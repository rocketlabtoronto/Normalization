Business, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
a) Business
Amerant Bancorp Inc. (the “Company”) is a Florida corporation incorporated in 1985, which has operated since January 1987. The Company is a bank holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (“BHC Act”), as a result of its 
100
% ownership of Amerant Bank, N.A. (the “Bank”). The Company’s principal office is in the City of Coral Gables, Florida. The Bank is a member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta (“Federal Reserve”) and the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta (“FHLB”). The Bank is a national bank subject to regulation and regular examinations by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”). The Bank has 
two
 operating subsidiaries: Amerant Investments, Inc., a securities broker-dealer (“Amerant Investments”) and Amerant Mortgage, LLC (“Amerant Mortgage”), a mortgage lending company domiciled in Florida (“Amerant Mortgage”).
Elant Bank & Trust Ltd., a Grand-Cayman based trust company (the “Cayman Bank”) is a subsidiary of the Bank. The Company is executing a plan for the dissolution of the Cayman Bank and, as of June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the Cayman Bank no longer had any trust relationships, many of which were transferred to the Bank. The dissolution of the Cayman Bank is expected to be completed in 2025, once regulatory approval from the applicable regulatory agency is received.
In April 2025, considering its strategic decision to focus on Florida, the Company announced its decision to transition the focus of its mortgage business from being a national mortgage originator to focusing on in-footprint mortgage lending to support the Company’s retail and private banking customer base.

Segment Information
Determination of the CODM
The Company’s Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) is its Chief Executive Officer (CEO). The CEO makes the overall decisions about the Company’s resource allocation and assesses the performance of the Company. 
Determination and Identification of operating segments
The CODM manages the Company as 
one
 operating segment: the consolidated Company as one entity.  All decisions regarding the allocation of financial, operational, and other resources are managed under this 
one
 segment. As part of the determination for the allocation of resources, the CODM regularly reviews net income as the measure of profit or loss. In addition, as part of the CODM’s assessment of the performance of the consolidated entity, the CODM also reviews the consolidated financial statements for significant expenses which include both cash and noncash items, such as amortization and depreciation and stock-based compensation. For more information on the significant components of net income or any significant cash or noncash items, refer to our accompanying consolidated financial statements or the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained within. The measure of assets is reported on the consolidated balance sheet as total consolidated assets.
Segment results
As the Company’s consolidated financial information as of June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024 conform with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP) and the Company is managed on a single operating business segment, we collectively refer to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the Segment Results for the measures of consolidated profit or loss, as well as consolidated total assets.

b) Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Significant Accounting Policies
 
 The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required for a fair statement of financial position, results of operations and cash flows in conformity with GAAP. These unaudited interim consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim periods presented. These adjustments are of a normal, recurring nature. Interim period operating results may not be indicative of the operating results for a full year or any other period. These unaudited interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 and for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024 and the accompanying footnote disclosures for the Company, which are included in the 2024 Form 10-K.
In the second quarter of 2025, the Company changed its policy for charging off unsecured consumer loans when balances are past-due 120 days or more. Previously, the Company charged-off these loan types when balances were 90 days past due. The Company believes this change is in line with regulatory guidance. There was no material impact to Company’s consolidated financial statements as of and for the six months ended ended June 30, 2025 as a result of this change in policy.
For a complete summary of our significant accounting policies, 
see
 Note 1 to the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements in the 2024 Form 10-K. 
Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Significant estimates made by management include: (i) the determination of the allowance for credit losses; (ii) the fair values of loans, securities and derivative contracts; (iii) the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance; and (iv) the determination of whether the amount of deferred tax assets will more likely than not be realized. Management believes that these estimates are appropriate. Actual results could differ from these estimates.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
Issued and Not Yet Adopted
The  Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”)  2024-03 and 2025-01 Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income—Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses, and Clarifying the Effective Date. This new guidance is intended to improve the disclosures a public company makes with respect to its expenses and seeks to address requests from financial statement users for more detailed information about the types of expenses in common captions. This new guidance is effective for public business entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements when adopted.

Subsequent Events
On July 4, 2025, federal legislation generally referred to as H.R. 1 - One Big Beautiful Bill Act (the “Act”) was signed into law. The Act includes a variety of tax provisions including permanently extending and modifying certain key aspects of existing tax law.
 
U.S. GAAP requires the effects of changes in tax laws and rates to be recognized in its financial statements in the period in which legislation is enacted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the Act on its consolidated financial statements; however, the Company does not anticipate a material impact resulting from the Act.
The effects of other significant subsequent events, if any, have been recognized or disclosed in these unaudited interim consolidated financial statements.

U.S. Government Sponsored Enterprise Debt Securities and U.S. Government Agency Debt Securities
At June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the Company held certain debt securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government and U.S. government-sponsored entities and agencies. The Company evaluates these securities for credit losses by reviewing current market conditions, the extent and nature of changes in fair value, credit ratings, default and delinquency rates and current analysts’ evaluations. The Company believes the decline in fair value on these debt securities below their amortized cost basis is attributable to changes in interest rates and investment securities markets, generally, and not credit quality. As a result, the Company did 
no
t record an Allowance for Credit Losses, or ACL, on these securities as of June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024. Additionally, the Company does not intend to sell these debt securities and it considers it is more likely than not that it will not be required to sell the securities before their anticipated recovery.

The ACL was determined utilizing a reasonable and supportable forecast period. The ACL was determined using a weighted-average of various economic scenarios provided by a third-party and incorporated qualitative components. There have not been material changes in our policies and methodology to estimate the ACL in the six months ended June 30, 2025.
The ACL increased by $
1.6
 million, or 
1.8
% at June 30, 2025, compared to December 31, 2024. The ACL as a percentage of total loans held for investment was 
1.20
% at June 30, 2025 compared to 
1.18
% at December 31, 2024. The increase in the ACL during the period included a provision for credit losses on loans in the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2025, which was partially offset by net charge-offs.

Table of Contents
Amerant Bancorp Inc. and Subsidiaries

In the second quarter of 2025, the provision for credit losses on loans included $
6.0
 million to cover for charge-offs, and $
2.2
 million due to macro-economic factors. This was partially offset by releases of $
1.5
 million due to lower loan balances and $
3.3
 million due to recoveries.
In the first half of 2025, the provision for credit losses on loans included $
14.1
 million for specific reserves, $
10.0
 million to cover net charge-offs, and $
4.7
 million due to model adjustments for macroeconomic factors, partially offset by releases of $
1.1
 million due to credit quality and other macroeconomic updates, $
2.3
 million due to lower loan balances and $
4.8
 million due to recoveries.
In the second quarter of 2025, the Company sold a participation in a Quick Service Restaurant (“QSR”)-related loan with carrying value of $
6.9
 million and ACL of $
4.8
 million as of March 31, 2025. Proceeds from the sale were $
2.2
 million which resulted in a charge off against the ACL of $
4.8
 million in the second quarter 2025.

Loan Modifications to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty
The Company modifies loans related to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties by providing multiple types of concessions. Typically, one type of concession, such as a term extension, is granted initially. If the borrower continues to experience financial difficulty, another concession, such as principal forgiveness, may be granted. 
The Company had 
no
 new loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty during the three  and six month periods ended June 30, 2025 and 2024. There were 
no
 modified loans that defaulted in the three and six months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024 and had been modified within the 12 months preceding the payment default.
As of June 30, 2025, there were 
no
 outstanding balances related to loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties compared to $
9.4
 million as of December 31, 2024. The $
9.4
 million as of December 31, 2024 was related to one commercial nonaccrual loan that was paid off in the second quarter of 2025.
Credit Risk Quality
The sufficiency of the ACL is reviewed at least quarterly by the Chief Risk Officer and the Chief Financial Officer. The Board of Directors considers the ACL as part of its review of the Company’s consolidated financial statements. As of June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the Company believes the ACL to be sufficient to absorb expected credit losses in the loans portfolio in accordance with GAAP.
Loans may be classified but not considered collateral dependent due to one of the following reasons: (1) the Company has established minimum dollar amount thresholds for individual assessment of expected credit losses, which results in loans under those thresholds being excluded from individual assessment of expected credit losses; and (2) classified loans may be considered in the assessment because the Company expects to collect all amounts due.
As part of the on-going monitoring of the credit quality of the Company’s loan portfolio, management tracks certain credit quality indicators including trends related primarily to (i) the risk rating of loans, (ii) the loan payment status, (iii) net charge-offs, (iv) nonperforming loans and (v) the general economic conditions in the main geographies where the Company’s borrowers conduct their businesses. The Company considers the views of its regulators as to loan classification and in the process of estimating expected credit losses. 
The Company utilizes an internal risk rating system to identify the risk characteristics of each of its loans, or group of homogeneous loans such as consumer loans. Internal risk ratings are updated on a continuous basis on a scale from 1 (worst credit quality) to 10 (best credit quality). Loans are then grouped in five master risk categories for purposes of monitoring rising levels of potential loss risks and to enable the activation of collection or recovery processes as defined in the Company’s Credit Risk Policy. 
Internal risk ratings are considered the most meaningful indicator of credit quality for commercial loans. 
Generally, internal risk ratings for commercial real estate loans and commercial loans with balances over $
3
 million are updated at least annually and more frequently if circumstances indicate that a change in risk rating may be warranted. For consumer loans, single-family residential loans and smaller commercial loans under $
3
 million, risk ratings are updated based on the loans past due status. 
The following is a summary of the master risk categories and their associated loan risk ratings, as well as a description of the general characteristics of the master risk category:

onclassified 
This category includes loans considered as Pass (5-10) and Special Mention (4). A loan classified as Pass is considered of sufficient quality to preclude a lower adverse rating. These loans are generally well protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the borrower or by the value of any collateral received. Special Mention loans are defined as having potential weaknesses that deserve management’s close attention which, if left uncorrected, could potentially result in further credit deterioration. Special Mention loans may include loans originated with certain credit weaknesses or that developed those weaknesses since their origination.
Classified 
This classification indicates the presence of credit weaknesses which could make loan repayment unlikely, such as partial or total late payments and other contractual defaults.
Substandard 
A loan classified substandard is inadequately protected by the sound worth and paying capacity of the borrower or the collateral pledged. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if the credit weaknesses are not corrected. Loss potential, while existing in the aggregate amount of substandard loans, does not have to exist in individual assets.
Doubtful 
These loans have all the weaknesses inherent in a loan classified as substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. These are poor quality loans in which neither the collateral, if any, nor the financial condition of the borrower presently ensure collection in full in a reasonable period of time. As a result, the possibility of loss is extremely high.
 
Loss 
Loans classified as loss are considered uncollectible and of such little value that the continuance as bankable assets is not warranted. This classification does not mean that the assets have absolutely no recovery or salvage value, but not to the point where a write-off should be deferred even though partial recoveries may occur in the future. This classification is based upon current facts, not probabilities. As a result, loans in this category should be promptly charged off in the period in which they are determined to be uncollectible.

 Collateral -Dependent Loans
Loans are considered collateral-dependent when the repayment of the loan is expected to be provided by the sale or operation of the underlying collateral. The Company performs an individual evaluation as part of the process of calculating the allowance for credit losses related to these loans. 
The following tables present the amortized cost basis of collateral dependent loans related to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty by type of collateral as of June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024:

Collateral dependent loans are evaluated on an individual basis for purposes of determining expected credit losses. For collateral-dependent loans where the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and the Company expects repayment of the financial asset to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral, the ACL is measured based on the difference between the fair value of the collateral and the amortized cost basis of the loan as of the measurement date. When repayment is expected to be from the operation of the collateral, expected credit losses are calculated as the amount by which the amortized cost basis of the loan exceeds the present value of expected cash flows from the operation of the collateral. When repayment is expected to be from the sale of the collateral, expected credit losses are calculated as the amount by which the amortized cost basis of the loan exceeds the fair value of the underlying collateral less estimated costs to sell. The ACL may be zero if the fair value of the collateral at the measurement date exceeds the amortized cost basis of the loan.
Other Individually Evaluated Loans
As of June 30, 2025, as part of the process of calculating the ACL, in addition to collateral dependent loans, the Company evaluated individually $
53.2
 million in commercial loans primarily in the restaurant, transportation and healthcare industries, in addition to collateral dependent loans ($
7.2
 million in a commercial loan in the restaurant industry as of December 31, 2024). The ACL on these loans as of June 30, 2025 was $
4.7

Derivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments 
Interest Rate Swaps On Debt Instruments
The Company enters into interest rate swap contracts on debt instruments which the Company designates and qualifies as cash flow hedges. These interest rate swaps are designed as cash flow hedges to manage the exposure that arises from differences in the amount of the Company’s known or expected cash receipts and the known or expected cash payments on designated debt instruments. These interest rate swap contracts involve the Company’s payment of fixed-rate amounts in exchange for the Company receiving variable-rate payments over the life of the contracts without exchange of the underlying notional amount.
 
At June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the Company had 
five
 interest rate swap contracts with notional amounts totaling $
64.2
 million maturing in the third and fourth quarters of 2025. These contracts were designated as cash flow hedges to manage the exposure of variable rate interest payments on all of the Company’s outstanding variable-rate junior subordinated debentures with principal amounts at June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024 totaling $
64.2
 million. The Company expects these interest rate swaps to be highly effective in offsetting the effects of changes in interest rates on cash flows associated with the Company’s variable-rate junior subordinated debentures. The Company recognized unrealized gains of $
0.1
 million and $
0.2
 million in the three months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, and unrealized gains of $
0.1
 million and $
0.4
 million in the six months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, in connection with these interest rate swap contracts, which were included as part of interest expense on junior subordinated debentures in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income.
In 2019, the Company terminated 
16
 interest rate swaps that had been designated as cash flow hedges of variable rate interest payments on the outstanding and expected rollover of variable-rate advances from the FHLB. The Company is recognizing the contracts’ cumulative net unrealized gains of $
8.9
 million in earnings over the remaining original life of the terminated interest rate swaps ranging between 
one month
 and 
seven years
. The Company recognizes a reduction of interest expense on FHLB advances as a result of this amortization.
Interest Rate Swaps On Loans
As of June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the Company had 
one
 interest rate swap contract with a notional amount of $
50.0
 million. In the second quarter of 2025, this contract matured and was renewed for another 2 years.  The Company designates this interest rate swap contract as a cash flow hedge to manage interest rate risk exposure on variable rate interest receipts on the first $
50
 million principal balance of a pool of loans. This interest rate swap contract involves the Company’s payment of variable-rate amounts in exchange for the Company receiving fixed-rate payments over the life of the contract without exchange of the underlying notional amount. Unrealized losses on these instruments are included as part of interest income on loans in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income.

Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments
  a) Customer related positions
The Company offers certain derivatives products, including interest rate swaps and caps, directly to qualified commercial banking customers to facilitate their risk management strategies. The Company partially offsets its exposure to interest rate swaps and caps by entering similar derivative contracts with various third-party brokers.
 Interest Rate Swaps
Interest rate swap contracts involve the Company’s payment of variable-rate amounts to customers in exchange for the Company receiving fixed-rate payments from customers over the life of the contracts without exchange of the underlying notional amount.
 The Company enters into swap participation agreements with other financial institutions to manage the credit risk exposure on certain interest rate swaps with customers. Under these agreements, the Company, as the beneficiary or guarantor, will receive or make payments from/to the counterparty if the borrower defaults on the related interest rate swap contract. The notional amount of these agreements is based on the Company’s pro-rata share of the related interest rate swap contracts.
Interest Rate Caps
Interest rate cap contracts involve the Company making payments if an interest rate exceeds the agreed strike price.
b) Economic Hedges
The Company enters into forward sale contracts  to effectively offset changes in market valuation on the trading securities portfolio. These forward sale contracts are the commitment to sell To-Be-Announced (“TBA”) mortgage-backed securities on a specific future date. At December 31, 2024, there were 
no
 derivatives classified as economic hedges. In each of the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2025, the net unrealized loss on these instruments was $
1.9
 million. This  amount was included in derivative losses, net in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income.
c) Mortgage Derivatives
The Company enters into interest rate lock commitments and forward sale contracts to manage the risk exposure in the mortgage banking area. Interest rate lock commitments guarantee the funding of residential mortgage loans originated for sale, at specified interest rates and times in the future. Forward sale contracts consist of commitments to deliver mortgage loans, originated and/or purchased, in the secondary market at a future date. A separate type of forward sale contracts are the commitment to sell To-Be-Announced (“TBA”) mortgage-backed securities on a specific future date. In each of the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2025, the change in the fair value of these instruments was an unrealized loss of $
0.3
 million. In the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, the change in the fair value of these instruments was unrealized loss of $
0.2
 million and $
0.5
 million, respectively.  These amounts were recorded as part of other noninterest income in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.

Credit Risk-Related Contingent Features
Some agreements may require the Company to pledge securities as collateral when the valuation of the interest rate swap derivative contracts fall below a certain amount. At June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, there were $
7.9
 million and $
0.4
 million, respectively, in securities pledged as collateral for interest rate swaps in a liability position. Additionally, most of our derivative arrangements with counterparties require the posting of collateral upon meeting certain net exposure thresholds. As of June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the Company had cash held as collateral for derivatives margin calls of $
6.3
 million and $
23.5
 million, respectively. 
See 
Note 2 “Interest Earning Deposits with Banks, Other Short-Term Investments and Restricted Cash” for additional information about cash held as collateral.

9.
Income Taxes
The Company uses an estimated annual effective tax rate method in computing its interim tax provision. This effective tax rate is based on forecasted annual consolidated pre-tax income, permanent tax differences and statutory tax rates. Under this method, the tax effect of certain items that do not meet the definition of ordinary income or expense are computed and recognized as discrete items when they occur.
The effective combined federal and state tax rates for the six months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024 were 
22.70
% and 
21.50
%, respectively. Effective tax rates differ from the statutory rates mainly due to the impact of forecasted permanent non-taxable interest and other income, forecasted permanent non-deductible expenses, and the effect of corporate state taxes.

Commitments and Contingencies
 From time to time the Company and its subsidiaries may be exposed to loss contingencies. In the ordinary course of business, those contingencies may include, known but unasserted claims, and legal/regulatory inquiries or examinations. The Company records these loss contingencies as a liability when the likelihood of loss is probable and an amount or range of loss can be reasonably estimated. In the opinion of management, the Company maintains a liability that is in an estimated amount sufficient to cover said loss contingencies, if any, at the reporting dates.
Financial instruments whose contract amount represents off-balance sheet credit risk at June 30, 2025 are generally short-term and are as follows:

Loans Held for Sale, at Lower of Cost or Fair Value
For loans held for sale that are carried at the lower of cost or fair value, the fair value is generally based on quoted market prices of similar loans less estimated cost to sell and is considered to be Level 3.
 Collateral Dependent Loans Measured For Expected Credit Losses
The carrying amount of collateral dependent loans is typically based on the fair value of the underlying collateral. The Company primarily uses third party appraisals to assist in measuring expected credit losses on collateral dependent loans. The Company also uses third party appraisal reviewers for loans with an outstanding balance of $
1
 million and above. These appraisals generally use the market or income approach valuation technique and use market observable data to formulate an opinion of the fair value of the loan’s collateral. However, the appraiser uses professional judgment in determining the fair value of the collateral or properties and may also adjust these values for changes in market conditions subsequent to the appraisal date. When current appraisals are not available for certain loans, the Company uses judgment on market conditions to adjust the most current appraisal. The sales prices may reflect prices of sales contracts not closed and the amount of time required to sell out the real estate project may be derived from current appraisals of similar projects. As a consequence, the fair value of the collateral is considered a Level 3 valuation.
 OREO 
The Company values Other Real Estate Owned (OREO), at the lower of cost or fair value of the property, less cost to sell. The fair value of the property is generally based upon recent appraisal values of the property, less cost to sell. The Company primarily uses third party appraisals to assist in measuring the valuation of OREO. Period revaluations are classified as level 3 as the assumptions used may not be observable. The Company had OREO balances of $
15.4
 million and $
18.1
 million as of June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively. In the second quarter of 2025, the Company sold 
two
 OREO properties for an aggregate of $
2.7
 million. and recognized a total net loss on sale $
0.8
 million in connection with these transactions.

As of June 30, 2025 and 2024, potential dilutive instruments consisted of unvested shares of restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance share units totaling 
598,770
 and 
539,072
, respectively. In the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, potential dilutive instruments were included in the diluted earnings per share computation because, when the unamortized deferred compensation cost related to these shares was divided by the average market price per share in those periods, fewer shares would have been purchased than restricted shares assumed issued. Therefore, in those periods, such awards resulted in higher diluted weighted average shares outstanding than basic weighted average shares outstanding, and had a dilutive effect on per share earnings.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion and analysis is designed to provide a better understanding of various factors related to Amerant Bancorp Inc.’s (the “Company,” “Amerant,” “our” or “we”) results of operations and financial condition and its subsidiaries, including its principal subsidiary, Amerant Bank, N.A. (the “Bank”). The Bank has two operating subsidiaries: Amerant Investments, Inc., a securities broker-dealer (“Amerant Investments”) and Amerant Mortgage, LLC, a mortgage lending company domiciled in Florida (“Amerant Mortgage”). 
For an update on the strategic focus of our mortgage business see “Amerant Mortgage Updates” below
.
This discussion is intended to supplement and highlight information contained in the accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements and related footnotes included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (the “Form 10-Q”), as well as the information contained in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024 filed on March 5, 2025 (the “2024 Form 10-K”).
Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
Various of the statements made in this Form 10-Q, including information incorporated herein by reference to other documents, are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of, and subject to, the protections of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).
All statements other than statements of historical fact are statements that could be forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include statements with respect to our beliefs, plans, objectives, goals, expectations, anticipations, assumptions, estimates, intentions and future performance and condition. Examples of forward-looking statements include but are not limited to: our future operating or financial performance, including revenues, expenses, expense savings, income or loss and earnings or loss per share, and other financial items; statements regarding expectations, plans or objectives for future operations, products or services, and our expectations on our securities repositioning and loan recoveries or reaching positive resolutions on problem loans. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, which may be beyond our control, and which may cause the actual results, performance, achievements, or financial condition of the Company to be materially different from future results, performance, achievements, or financial condition expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. You should not expect us to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. These forward-looking statements should be read together with the “Risk Factors” included in the 2024 Form 10-K , and in our other filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), which are available at the SEC’s website www.sec.gov.  
All statements other than statements of historical fact are statements that could be forward-looking statements. You can identify these forward-looking statements through our use of words such as “may,” “will,” “anticipate,” “assume,” “seek,” “should,” “indicate,” “would,” “believe,” “contemplate,” “consider”, “expect,” “estimate,” “continue,” “plan,” “point to,” “project,” “could,” “intend,” “target” and other similar words and expressions of the future. These forward-looking statements may not be realized due to a variety of factors, including, without limitation: 
•
Liquidity risks could affect our operations and jeopardize our financial condition and certain funding sources could increase our interest rate expense;
•
We may not be able to develop and maintain a strong core deposit base or other low-cost funding sources;
•
We may elect or be compelled to seek additional capital in the future, but that capital may not be available when it is needed or on acceptable terms;
•
Our ability to receive dividends from our subsidiaries could affect our liquidity and our ability to pay dividends;
•
Our profitability is subject to interest rate risk; 
53
•
Our allowance for credit losses may prove inadequate;
•
Our concentration of CRE loans could result in increased loan losses;
•
Many of our loans are to commercial borrowers, which have unique risks compared to other types of loans;
•
Our valuation of securities and the determination of a credit loss allowance in our investment securities portfolio are subjective and, if changed, could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition;
•
Nonperforming and similar assets take significant time to resolve and may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows;
•
We are subject to environmental liability risk associated with lending activities;
•

We provide individuals and businesses a comprehensive array of deposit, credit, investment, wealth management, retail banking, mortgage services, and fiduciary services. We serve customers in our United States markets and select international customers. These services are offered through the Bank, which is also headquartered in Coral Gables, Florida, and its operating subsidiaries, Amerant Investments and Amerant Mortgage.

The Cayman Bank is a subsidiary of the Bank. The Company is executing a plan for the dissolution of the Cayman Bank and, as of the end of the third quarter of 2024, the Cayman Bank no longer had any trust relationships, many of which were transferred to the Bank. The dissolution of the Cayman Bank, is expected to be completed in 2025, once regulatory approval from the applicable regulatory agency is received.
Business Developments
For more information on the progress of our business strategy and strategic initiatives in 2024, 
see 
Item 1. Business section included in the 2024 Form 10-K.
People and Channels
In the first quarter of 2025, we had strategic additions to our leadership team, particularly our risk management function. We hired a new Chief Credit Officer who started in mid-March 2025, leading a focused assessment of our current credit functions and credit quality overall. He is also now a part of our Executive Management Committee. We also hired a new Head of Treasury Management who will help expand our treasury management services and grow core deposit relationships. Lastly, our Chief Business Development Officer, who had joined the Company last year has now assumed additional responsibilities as Chief Consumer Banking Officer, where he will leverage his extensive business development, private banking and wealth management experience to further elevate the Company’s consumer banking strategy.  In the second quarter of 2025, we hired a new Head of Special Assets on the risk management side, and a Head of Business Development. Additionally, in July 2025. we hired our new Head of Credit of C&I.  
In April 2025, we opened our new regional headquarters office and our new banking center in West Palm Beach. We currently have two planned openings in Miami Beach, FL and a second location in downtown Tampa, FL in the coming months. In July 2025, the Company received regulatory approval for the opening of a new banking center in St Petersburg, Florida which we currently expect to open in mid-2026.

Amerant Mortgage
In April 2025, considering its strategic decision to focus on Florida, the Company announced its decision to transition the focus of its mortgage business from being a national mortgage originator to focusing on in-footprint mortgage lending to support the Company’s retail and private banking customer base. Since April 2025 and throughout the early part of the fourth quarter of 2025, the Company plans to progressively reduce the FTE count from 77 FTEs to approximately 20, transfer loans owned into our core platform, and exit and/or modify existing vendor contracts.
We believe these strategic actions will support our ongoing efforts in becoming the bank of choice in the markets we serve. 
Macroeconomic Outlook
The economy is currently experiencing heightened uncertainty, primarily due to market reactions to changes in tariff policies. Throughout the second quarter of 2025, the Federal Reserve has maintained interest rates steady, despite inflation remaining above its 2% target. Tariffs have the potential to exacerbate inflationary pressures, although the duration of their impact—whether temporary or prolonged—remains uncertain.
In terms of employment, data has remained relatively stable, with the unemployment rate slightly increasing to just above 4%. Federal Reserve officials, including Chairman Powell, have indicated a willingness to exercise patience at current levels of inflation and unemployment to better understand how policy changes affect economic indicators.
Overall, the economic data presents a mixed picture. While the manufacturing sector continues to contract, the services sector is expanding, albeit at a slower pace compared to the previous two quarters. Additionally, consumer spending in the United States appears to be decelerating. Historical data suggests signs of an economic slowdown are emerging. While recession odds have decreased from earlier highs in 2025, they remain somewhat elevated compared to the long-term average.
This macroeconomic environment has contributed to volatility across the banking industry and other sectors. Consequently, we continuously face challenges in executing our business strategy. These include expanding our balance sheet (especially loans and deposits) amid fierce competition, adapting to fluctuating interest rates, and complying with evolving regulatory requirements.
While these are widespread challenges for the banking industry, the Company has not experienced a material impact to its business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
On July 4, 2025, federal legislation generally referred to as H.R. 1 - One Big Beautiful Bill Act (the “Act”) was signed into law. The Act includes a variety of tax provisions including permanently extending and modifying certain key aspects of existing tax law.
 
U.S. GAAP requires the effects of changes in tax laws and rates to be recognized in its financial statements in the period in which legislation is enacted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the Act on its consolidated financial statements; however, the Company does not anticipate a material impact resulting from the Act.

Primary Factors Used to Evaluate Our Business
Results of Operations.
 In addition to net income or loss, the primary factors we use to evaluate and manage our results of operations include net interest income, noninterest income and expenses, and indicators of financial performance including return on assets (“ROA”) and return on equity (“ROE”). We also use certain non-GAAP financial measures in the internal evaluation and management of our businesses.
Net Interest Income.
 Net interest income represents interest income less interest expense. We generate interest income from interest, dividends and fees received on interest-earning assets, including loans and investment securities we own. We incur interest expense from interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities, including interest-bearing deposits, and borrowings such as advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta (“FHLB”) and other borrowings such as repurchase agreements, notes, debentures and other funding sources we may have from time to time. Net interest income typically is the most significant contributor to our revenues and net income. To evaluate net interest income, we measure and monitor: (i) yields on our loans and other interest-earning assets; (ii) the costs of our deposits and other funding sources; (iii) our net interest spread; (iv) our net interest margin, or NIM; and (v) our provisions for credit losses. Net interest spread is the difference between rates earned on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. NIM is calculated by dividing net interest income for the period by average interest-earning assets during that same period. Because noninterest-bearing sources of funds, such as noninterest-bearing deposits and stockholders’ equity, also fund interest-earning assets, NIM includes the benefit of these noninterest-bearing sources of funds. Non-refundable loan origination fees, net of direct costs of originating loans, as well as premiums or discounts paid on loan purchases, are deferred and recognized over the life of the related loan as an adjustment to interest income in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).
Changes in market interest rates and the interest we earn on interest-earning assets, or which we pay on interest-bearing liabilities, as well as the volumes and the types of interest-earning assets, interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing liabilities and stockholders’ equity, usually have the largest impact on periodic changes in our net interest spread, NIM and net interest income. We measure net interest income before and after the provision for credit losses. 
Noninterest Income.
 Noninterest income consists of, among other revenue streams: (i) service fees on deposit accounts; (ii) income from brokerage, advisory and fiduciary activities; (iii) benefits from and changes in cash surrender value of bank-owned life insurance, or BOLI, policies; (iv) card and trade finance servicing fees; (v) securities gains or losses; (vi) net gains and losses on early extinguishment of FHLB advances which we may execute from time to time as part of asset/liability management activities; (vii) income from derivative transactions with customers; (viii) derivative gains or losses; and (ix) other noninterest income which includes mortgage banking revenue and gains or losses on the sale of loans originated for investment.
Our income from service fees on deposit accounts is affected primarily by the volume, growth and mix of deposits we hold and volume of transactions initiated by customers (i.e. wire transfers). These are affected by prevailing market pricing of deposit services, interest rates, our marketing efforts and other factors.
Our income from brokerage, advisory and fiduciary activities consists of brokerage commissions related to our customers’ trading volume, fiduciary and investment advisory fees generally based on a percentage of the average value of assets under management and custody (“AUM”), and account administrative services and ancillary fees during the contractual period. 
Income from changes in the cash surrender value of our BOLI policies represents the amounts that may be realized under the contracts with the insurance carriers, which are nontaxable. In the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company restructured certain of its BOLI contracts, by surrendering existing lower-yielding policies and reinvesting the proceeds in higher-yielding policies. This transaction is expected to increase income from this source prospectively.
59
 Interchange fees, other fees and revenue sharing are recognized when earned. Trade finance servicing fees, which primarily include commissions on letters of credit, are generally recognized over the service period on a straight line basis. Card servicing fees include credit and debit card interchange fees and other fees. We have also entered into referral arrangements with recognized U.S.-based card issuers, which permit us to serve our customers and earn referral fees and share interchange revenue without exposure to credit risk.  
 
Our gains and losses on sales of securities are derived from sales from our securities portfolio and are primarily dependent on changes in U.S. Treasury interest rates and asset liability management activities. Generally, as U.S. Treasury rates increase, our securities portfolio decreases in market value, and as U.S. Treasury rates decrease, our securities portfolio increases in value. We also recognize unrealized gains or losses on changes in the valuation of our trading securities portfolio and our marketable equity securities not held for trading.
Our fee income generated on customer interest rate swaps and other loan level derivatives is primarily dependent on the volume of transactions completed with customers and are included in noninterest income.
 Derivatives unrealized net gains and derivatives unrealized net losses are primarily derived from fair market value changes in the derivative position of our economic hedges on trading.
Other noninterest income includes mortgage banking income generated through our subsidiary, Amerant Mortgage, and consists of gain on sale of loans, gain on loans market valuation, other fees and smaller sources of income. Mortgage banking income was $0.7 million and $1.9 million in the three months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, and $1.2 million and $3.0 million in the six months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. Other income in the three and six months ended June 30, 2025, includes approximately $0.4 million and $3.2 million, respectively, of net gain on sale of loans originated for investment.
Non-routine noninterest income items include other non-routine noninterest income. Other non-routine noninterest income items include the effect of items such as derivative losses, securities gains and losses, gains on sale of loans, amongst others items non-recurrent in nature. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for more information on non-routine noninterest income items.
Noninterest Expense.
 Noninterest expenses generally increase as our business grows and whenever necessary to implement or enhance policies and procedures for regulatory compliance, and other purposes.
Noninterest expense consists of: (i) salaries and employee benefits; (ii) occupancy and equipment expenses; (iii) professional and other services fees; (iv) loan-level derivative expenses; (v) FDIC deposit and business insurance assessments and premiums; (vi) telecommunication and data processing expenses; (vii) depreciation and amortization; (viii) advertising and marketing expenses; (ix) other real estate and repossessed assets, net; (x) losses on sale of assets, and (xi) other operating expenses.
Salaries and employee benefits include compensation (including severance expenses which we generally consider non-routine), employee benefits and employer tax expenses for our personnel. Salaries and employee benefits are partially offset by costs directly related to the origination of loans, which are deferred and amortized over the life of the related loans as adjustments to interest income in accordance with GAAP.
Occupancy expense consists of lease expense on our leased properties, including right-of-use or ROU asset impairment charges, and other occupancy-related expenses. Equipment expense includes furniture, fixtures and equipment related expenses. Rental income associated with subleasing portions of the Company’s headquarters building and the subleasing of the New York office space, primarily, is included as a reduction to rent expense under lease agreements under occupancy and equipment cost.
Professional and other services fees include the cost of outsourced services, including technology infrastructure and banking processing services from our new technology provider, and other professional consulting fees associated with our transition to a new core banking platform, legal, accounting and related consulting fees, card 
60
processing fees, director’s fees, regulatory agency fees, such as OCC examination fees, and other fees related to our business operations. 
Loan-level derivative expenses are incurred in back-to-back derivative transactions with commercial loan clients and with brokers. The Company pays a fee upon inception of the back-to-back derivative transactions, corresponding to the spread between a wholesale rate and a retail rate.
Advertising expenses include the costs of promoting the Amerant brand, as well as the costs associated with promoting the Company’s products and services to create positive awareness, or consideration to buy the Company’s products and services. These costs include expenses to produce, deliver and communicate advertisements using available media and technologies, primarily streaming and other digital advertising platforms. Advertising expenses are expensed as incurred, except for media production costs which are expensed upon the first airing of the advertisement.
FDIC deposit and business insurance assessments and premiums include deposit insurance, net of any credits applied against these premiums, corporate liability and other business insurance premiums.
Telecommunication and data processing expenses include expenses paid to our third-party data processing system providers and other telecommunication and data service providers.
Depreciation and amortization expense includes the value associated with the depletion of the value on our owned properties and equipment, including leasehold improvements made to our leased properties.
OREO and repossessed assets expense includes 
expenses and revenue (rental income) from the operation of foreclosed property/assets as well as fair value adjustments and gains/losses from the sale of OREO and repossessed assets.
Other operating expenses include community engagement, earnings credits, mortgage loan origination and servicing expenses, charitable contributions, postage and courier expenses, debits which mirror the valuation income on the investment balances held in the non-qualified deferred compensation plan in order to adjust the liability to participants of the deferred compensation plan, and other small operational expenses. Earnings credits are provided to certain commercial depositors primarily in the mortgage banking industry to help offset deposit service charges incurred.
Non-routine noninterest expense items include other non-routine noninterest expenses. Other non-routine noninterest expenses include the effect of items such as OREO and loans held for sale valuation allowances, sale of repossessed assets, impairment of investments, gains on sale of loans, amongst others items non-recurrent in nature. 
See 
“Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for more information on non-routine noninterest expense items.

Primary Factors Used to Evaluate Our Financial Condition
The primary factors we use to evaluate and manage our financial condition include asset quality, capital and liquidity.
Asset Quality.
 We manage the diversification and quality of our assets based upon factors that include the level, distribution and risks in each category of assets. Problem assets may be categorized as classified, delinquent, nonaccrual, and nonperforming assets. We also manage the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses, or the allowance, the diversification and quality of loan and investment portfolios, the extent of counterparty risks, credit risk concentrations and other factors.
Capital.
 Financial institution regulators have established minimum capital ratios for banks and bank holding companies. We manage capital based upon factors that include: (i) the level and quality of capital and our overall financial condition; (ii) the trend and volume of problem assets; (iii) the adequacy of reserves; (iv) the level and quality of earnings; (v) the risk exposures in our balance sheet under various scenarios, including stressed conditions; (vi) the Tier 1 capital ratio, the total capital ratio, the Tier 1 leverage ratio, and the CET1 capital ratio; (vii) the tangible common equity ratio; and (viii) other factors, including market conditions.
Liquidity.
 Our deposit base consists primarily of personal and commercial accounts maintained by individuals and businesses in our primary markets and select international core depositors. The Company is focused on relationship-driven core deposits. The Company may also use third party providers of domestic sources of deposits as part of its balance sheet management strategies. We define core deposits as total deposits excluding all time deposits. This definition of core deposits differs from the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council’s (the “FFIEC”) Uniform Bank Performance Report (the “UBPR”) definition of “core deposits,” which exclude brokered time deposits and retail time deposits of more than $250,000.
 See 
“Core Deposits” discussion for more details.
We manage liquidity based upon factors that include the amount of core deposit relationships as a percentage of total deposits, the level of diversification of our funding sources, the allocation and amount of our deposits among deposit types, the short-term funding sources used to fund assets, the amount of non-deposit funding used to fund assets, the availability of unused funding sources, off-balance sheet obligations, the amount of cash and liquid securities we hold, the availability of assets readily convertible into cash without undue loss, the characteristics and maturities of our assets when compared to the characteristics of our liabilities and other factors.  
Seasonality
. 
Our loan production, generally, is subject to seasonality, with the lowest volume typically in the first quarter of each year.

(1)    In the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, potential dilutive instruments consisted of unvested shares of restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance share units. 
See
 Note 13 to our unaudited interim consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q for details on the dilutive effects of the issuance of restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance share units on earnings per share.
Three Months Ended June 30, 2025 and 2024
In the three months ended June 30, 2025, net income attributable to the Company was $23.0 million, or $0.55 income per diluted share, compared to net income of $5.0 million, or $0.15 income per diluted share, in the same quarter of 2024. The increase of $18.0 million, or 363.5%, in the three months ended June 30, 2025 was primarily driven by higher net interest income and noninterest income, as well as lower provision for credit losses. These results were partially offset by higher noninterest expense.
65
 
Net interest income was $90.5 million in the three months ended June 30, 2025, an increase of $11.1 million, or 14.0%, from $79.4 million in the three months ended June 30, 2024. This was primarily driven by the lower cost of interest-bearing liabilities which decreased 45 basis points in the second quarter compared to the same period last year. Additionally, there was an increase of $501.6 million, or 39.6%, $69.0 million or 1.0%, and $150.0 million or 41.2%, in the average balances of debt securities available for sale, the loan portfolio, and deposits with banks, respectively, during the period. These improvements were partially offset by: (i) a 21 basis points decrease in the average yield on total interest earning assets; (ii) an increase of $188.2 million, or 2.6%, in the average balance of total interest-bearing liabilities  in the second quarter compared to the same period last year; and (iii) a decrease of $221.1 million, or 100.0%, in the average balance of debt securities held to maturity.
Noninterest income was $19.8 million in the three months ended June 30, 2025 compared to noninterest income of $19.4 million in the three months ended June 30, 2024. The increase was mainly driven by: (i) securities gains, net compared to losses in the previous period; (ii) higher loan-level derivative income; (iii)  higher total brokerage, advisory and fiduciary activities; and (iv) cards and trade finance servicing fees. These results were partially offset by higher derivatives losses, net and lower deposit and services fees.  
See
 “Noninterest Income” for more details.
In the three months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, noninterest income included certain non-routine income and loss items. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for more information on non-routine noninterest income items.
Noninterest expense was $74.4 million in the three months ended June 30, 2025, an increase of $1.1 million, or 1.5%, compared to $73.3 million in the same period in 2024. This increase was mainly due to: (i) higher salary and employee benefits; (ii) higher professional and other service fees; (iii) higher net OREO and repossessed assets expenses; (iv) higher advertising expenses; and (v) higher loan-level derivative expenses; These increases were partially offset by: (i) lower occupancy and equipment expenses; and (ii) lower losses on loans held for sale carried at the lower of cost or fair value. 
See
 “Noninterest Expense
” 
for more details.
In the three months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, noninterest expense included total non-routine items of $1.2 million and $5.6 million, respectively. Other non-routine items in noninterest expense in the three months ended June 30, 2024, included: (i) $3.4 million in fixed assets impairment, a (ii) $1.3 million loss on loans held for sale for valuation expense, (iii) $0.6 million in legal and broker fees, and (iv) $0.3 million in goodwill and intangible asset impairment. All non-routine items mentioned in the three months ended June 30, 2024 are related to the Houston Sale Transaction completed in 2024.  See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for more information on non-routine noninterest expense items.
In the three months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, the Company incurred noninterest expenses of $3.0 million and $3.8 million, respectively, related to Amerant Mortgage which consists of salaries and employee benefits expense, mortgage lending costs and professional and other services fees. Amerant Mortgage had 35 full time equivalent employees (“FTEs”) at June 30, 2025 compared to 83 at June 30, 2024.
Six Months Ended June 30, 2025 and 2024 
In the six months ended June 30, 2025, net income attributable to the Company was $35.0 million, or $0.83 income per diluted share, compared to net income of $15.5 million, or $0.46 income per diluted share, in the same period of 2024. The increase of $19.4 million, or 125.10%, in the six months ended June 30, 2025 was primarily driven by higher net interest income and noninterest income, as well as lower provision for credit losses. These results were partially offset by higher noninterest expense.
66
 
Net interest income was $176.4 million in the six months ended June 30, 2025, an increase of $19.1 million, or 12.1%, from $157.3 million in the six months ended June 30, 2024. This was primarily driven by an increase of $368.3 million, or 29.4%, $128.0 million or 1.8%, and $153.6 million or 39.0%, in the average balances of debt securities available for sale, the loan portfolio, and deposits with banks, respectively, during the period. Additionally, the cost of interest-bearing liabilities decreased 40 basis points in the current year compared to the same period last year. These improvements were partially offset by: (i) a decrease of $223.0 million, or 100.0%, in the average balance of debt securities held to maturity; (ii) a 17 basis points decrease in the average yield on total interest earning assets; and (iii) an increase of $124.8 million, or 1.7%, in the average balance of total interest-bearing liabilities in the current year compared to the same period last year.
Noninterest income was $39.3 million in the six months ended June 30, 2025 compared to noninterest income of $33.9 million in the six months ended June 30, 2024. The increase was mainly driven by: (i) securities gains, net compared to losses in the previous period; (ii) higher loan-level derivative income; (iii) higher total brokerage, advisory and fiduciary activities; (iv)  higher deposits and service fees;  (v) higher cards and trade finance servicing fees; and (vi) higher other noninterest income. These changes were partially offset primarily by higher derivatives losses. 
See
 “Noninterest Income” for more details.
In the six months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, noninterest income included non-routine items of $2.8 million and $0.2 million.  See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for more information on non-routine noninterest income items.
Noninterest expense was $146.0 million in the six months ended June 30, 2025, an increase of $6.1 million, or 1.5%, compared to $139.9 million in the same period in 2024. This increase was mainly due to: (i) higher professional and other service fees; (ii) higher advertising expenses; (iii) higher net OREO and repossessed assets expenses; (iv) higher salary and employee benefits; and (v) higher loan-level derivative expenses. These increases were partially offset by: (i) lower occupancy and equipment expenses, and (ii) lower losses on loans held for sale carried at the lower of cost or fair value. 
See
 “Noninterest Expense
” 
for more details.
In the six months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, noninterest expense included total non-routine items of $1.7 million and $5.6 million, respectively.

Net Interest Income
Three Months Ended June 30, 2025 and 2024
Net interest income in the three months ended June 30, 2025, was $90.5 million, an increase of $11.1 million, or 14.0%, from $79.4 million in the three months ended June 30, 2024. This was primarily driven by: (i) lower cost of interest bearing liabilities which decreased by 45 basis points in the second quarter of 2025 compared to the same period one year ago, (ii) increases of $501.6 million, or 39.6%, $69.0 million or 1.0%,  and $150.0 million or 41.2%, in the average balances of debt securities available for sale, the loan portfolio, and deposits with banks, respectively, during the period.
These improvements were partially offset by (i) a 21 basis points decrease in the average yield on total interest earning assets, mainly loans and deposits with banks,  and (ii) an increase of $188.2 million or 2.6%, in the average balance of total interest-bearing liabilities in the second quarter compared to the same period last year, mainly driven by a higher average balance in money market deposit accounts; and (iii) a decrease of $221.1 million, or 100.0%, in the average balance of debt securities held to maturity. Net interest margin was 3.81%  in the three months ended June 30, 2025, an increase of 25 basis points from 3.56% in the three months ended June 30, 2024.

In addition, we had no debt securities held to maturity at June 30, 2025, compared to $219.6 million at June 30, 2024. The Company was able to reprice the cost of its interest-bearing deposits to offset lower yields on the loan portfolio we recorded during the second quarter of 2025 compared to the same period last year.  Additionally, we continued investing in higher-yielding, fixed rate, debt securities available for sale, and maintaining a high average balance in funds at the Federal Reserve.

This was primarily driven by an increase of $501.6 million, or 39.6%,  and $150.0 million or 41.2%, in the average balances of debt securities available for sale and deposits with banks, respectively, during the period. These increases were partially offset by: (i) a decrease of $221.1 million, or 100.0%, in the average balance of debt securities held to maturity and (ii) an 21 basis points decrease in the average yield on total interest earning assets, mainly loans and deposits with banks.

This was mainly due to an increase of $501.6 million, or 39.6% in the average balance of these securities as well as an increase of 50 basis points in average yields, primarily as a result of the investment portfolio repositioning that was completed in October 2024.

Three Months Ended June 30, 2025
 and 2024 
Total noninterest income increased $0.4 million, or 1.8%, in the three months ended June 30, 2025, compared to the same period last year, mainly due to: (i) higher securities gains; (ii) higher loan-level derivative income; (iii) higher cards and trade finance servicing fees; and (iv) higher brokerage, advisory and fiduciary fees. These increases were partially offset by: (i) higher derivatives losses, (ii) lower other noninterest income, and (iii) lower deposits and service fees,
In the second quarter of 2025, the Company executed a new investment strategy and purchased $0.0 million in trading securities. In addition, in the same period, as part of this investment strategy, we entered into to-be-announced TBA MBS derivative contracts to offset the changes in market valuation on the trading securities portfolio. In the three months ended June 30, 2025, securities gains were $1.8 million, mainly unrealized gains on market valuation of the trading securities portfolio, compared to losses of $0.1 million in the same period in 2024. In the three months ended June 30, 2024, these losses related to a sale of an AFS security. Securities gains in the second quarter of 2025 were offset by derivatives losses of $1.9 million which consisted of net losses on the TBA MBS derivative contracts.
Loan-level derivative income increased $0.8 million, or 35.9%, in the three months ended June 30, 2025 compared to the same period in 2024, mainly driven by new swap contracts during the period compared to the same period last year. 
Cards and trade finance servicing fees increased $0.5 million, or 35.5% in the three months ended June 30, 2025 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024, mainly driven by higher commissions from the issuance of letters of credits.
Brokerage, advisory and fiduciary fees increased $0.5 million, or 10.0%, in the three months ended June 30, 2025, compared to the same period one year ago. This was mainly driven by higher fees from equity and fixed income trading in the second quarter of 2025 versus second quarter of 2024.
Our AUMs totaled $3.07 billion at June 30, 2025, an increase of $175.0 million, or 6.1%, from $2.89 billion at December 31, 2024, primarily driven by higher market valuations and, to a lesser extent, net new assets.
Other noninterest income decreased $1.3 million, or 34.3%, in the three months ended June 30, 2025 compared to the same period in 2024, primarily driven by a $1.2 million decrease in mortgage banking income.
Deposits and service fees decreased $0.3 million, or 5.9%, in the three months ended June 30, 2025, compared to the same period in 2024, primarily driven by lower commissions income on wire transfers.
Six Months Ended June 30, 2025 and 2024
Total noninterest income increased $5.4 million, or 15.9%, in the six months ended June 30, 2025, compared to the six months ended June 30, 2024 mainly due to: (i) higher securities gains; (ii) higher loan-level derivative income; (iii) higher other non-interest income; (iv) higher brokerage, advisory and fiduciary fees; (v) higher cards and trade finance servicing fees; and (vi) higher deposits and service fees. These increases were partially offset by higher derivatives losses.
79
 
In the six months ended June 30, 2025, securities gains were $1.8 million, mainly unrealized gains on market valuation of the trading securities portfolio, compared to a $0.2 million loss in the same period in 2024. In the six months ended June 30, 2024, these losses were related to the sale of an AFS security and a decrease in valuation of equity securities. Securities gains in the first half of 2025 were offset by derivatives losses of $1.9 million which consisted of net losses on the TBA MBS derivative contracts.
Loan-level derivative income increased $1.9 million, or 66.9%, in the six months ended June 30, 2025 compared to the same period in 2024, mainly driven by new swap contracts during the period compared to the same period last year. Additionally, we recognized income associated with swap terminations during the three months ended June 30, 2025.
Other noninterest income increased $1.0 million, or 17.4%, in the six months ended June 30, 2025 compared to the same period in 2024, primarily driven by net gains from loan note sales, including $3.2 million related to a loan note sale that was previously charged-off. The increase was partially offset by a $1.8 million decrease in mortgage banking income.
Brokerage, advisory and fiduciary fees increased $0.9 million, or 9.7%, in the six months ended June 30, 2025, compared to the same period in 2024. This was mainly driven by higher fees from equity and fixed income trading in the first half of 2025 versus the first half of 2024.
Cards and trade finance servicing fees increased $0.6 million, or 25.1% in the six months ended June 30, 2025 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2024, mainly driven by higher commissions from the issuance of letters of credits.
Deposits and service fees increased $0.5 million, or 5.2%, in the six months ended June 30, 2025, compared to the same period in 2024, primarily driven by an increase in statement fees on business accounts.

Three Months Ended June 30, 2025 and 2024
Noninterest expense increased $1.1 million, or 1.5%, in the three months ended June 30, 2025 compared to the same period in 2024, mainly due to: (i) higher salary and employee benefits; (ii) higher professional and other service fees, (iii) higher net OREO and repossessed assets expenses; (iv) higher advertising expenses, and (v) higher loan-level derivative expenses. These increases were partially offset by: (i) lower occupancy and equipment expenses, and (ii) the absence of a $1.2 million valuation expense on loans held for sale at the lower of cost or fair value in the second quarter of 2024.
Salaries and employee benefits increased $2.2 million, or 6.4%, in the three months ended June 30, 2025 compared to the same period one year ago, mainly driven by higher salary expense as a result of the new hires in the period and higher severance expenses. These expenses were partially offset by a decrease in total FTE count compared to the same period last year. At June 30, 2025, our FTEs were 692, a net decrease of 28 FTEs, or 3.9%, compared to 720 FTEs at June 30, 2024.
Professional and other services fees increased $1.4 million, or 11.9%, in the three months ended June 30, 2025 compared to the same period last year. This was mainly driven by an overall increase in other professional fees related to outsourced core software and technology services and consulting fees related to various projects.
Other real estate owned and repossessed assets expenses increased $0.7 million, or 506.1%, in the three months ended June 30, 2025, compared to the same period last year. This was mainly due to losses on sale of two OREO properties in the second quarter of 2025.
Advertising expenses increased $0.6 million, or 13.6%, in the three months ended June 30, 2025 compared to the same period last year. This was mainly driven by higher expenses related to traditional media and professional sports agreements.
Loan-level derivative expenses increased $0.5 million, or 91.9%, in the three months ended June 30, 2025, compared to the same period last year due to higher expenses during the period associated with payments for opening of new swaps and caps with clients.
Occupancy and equipment expenses decreased $3.6 million, or 39.3%, in the three months ended June 30, 2025 compared to the same period one year ago mainly driven by the absence of a $3.4 million fixed assets impairment charge in the second quarter of 2024 in connection with the Houston Transaction.
82
 
Six Months Ended June 30, 2025 and 2024
Noninterest expense increased $6.1 million, or 4.3%, in the six months ended June 30, 2025 compared to the same period in 2024, mainly due to: (i) higher professional and other service fees; (ii)  higher salary and employee benefits; (iii) higher net OREO and repossessed assets expenses; (iv) higher advertising expenses, and (iv) higher loan-level derivative expenses. These increases were partially offset by: (i) lower occupancy and equipment expenses, and (ii) the absence of a $1.2 million valuation expense on loans held for sale at the lower of cost or fair value in the first half of 2024.
Professional and other services fees increased $5.2 million, or 22.4%, in the six months ended June 30, 2025 compared to the same period last year. This was mainly driven by an overall increase in other professional fees related to outsourced core software and technology services, mortgage servicing expenses, accounting fees in connection with outsourced audit fees and consulting and legal fees related to various projects.
Salaries and employee benefits increased $2.6 million, or 3.8%, in the six months ended June 30, 2025 compared to the same period one year ago, mainly driven by: (i) higher salary expense as a result of the new hires, and (ii) higher severance expenses. This was partially offset by lower equity variable compensation in connection with the long-term incentive program mainly attributable to the effect of forfeitures during the period.
Other real estate owned and repossessed assets expenses increased $1.3 million, or 252.4%, in the six months ended June 30, 2025, compared to the same period last year. This was mainly due to losses on sale and valuation  expense on OREO properties during the first half of 2025. 
Advertising expenses increased $1.1 million, or 15.5%, in the six months ended June 30, 2025 compared to the same period last year. This was mainly driven by higher expenses related to traditional media and professional sports agreements as well as higher expenses related to community engagement events.
Loan-level derivative expenses increased $0.9 million in the six months ended June 30, 2025, compared to the same period last year due to higher expenses during the period associated with payments for opening of new swaps and caps with clients.
Occupancy and equipment expenses decreased $3.9 million, or 25.1%, in the six months ended June 30, 2025 compared to the same period one year ago primarily due to: (i) the absence of a $3.4 million fixed assets impairment charge in the second quarter of 2024 in connection with the Houston Transaction,  (ii) fewer banking centers as a result of the Houston Sale Transaction, and (iii) an increase in sublease income from additional subleasing of portions of the headquarter building.

Income tax expense increased to $6.8 million in the second quarter of 2025 from $1.4 million in the second quarter of 2024, and to $10.3 million in the first half of 2025 from $4.3 million in the first half of 2024, mainly driven by higher income before income taxes in the 2025 periods compared to the same periods last year.
As of June 30, 2025, the Company’s net deferred tax assets were $51.0 million, a decrease of $2.6 million, or 4.8%, compared to $53.5 million as of December 31, 2024. This was primarily driven by a decrease of $5.0 million in connection with $19.4 million in net unrealized holding gains on debt securities available for sale during the period, partially offset by the tax effect of an increase in the allowance for credit losses.
On July 4, 2025, federal legislation generally referred to as H.R. 1 - One Big Beautiful Bill Act (the “Act”) was signed into law. The Act includes a variety of tax provisions including permanently extending and modifying certain key aspects of existing tax law.
 
U.S. GAAP requires the effects of changes in tax laws and rates to be recognized in its financial statements in the period in which legislation is enacted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the Act on its consolidated financial statements; however, the Company does not anticipate a material impact resulting from the Act.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The Company supplements its financial results that are determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) with non-GAAP financial measures, such as “pre-provision net revenue (PPNR)”, “core pre-provision net revenue (Core PPNR)”, “core noninterest income”, and “core noninterest expense”. This supplemental information is not required by, or is not presented in accordance with GAAP. The Company refers to these financial measures and ratios as “non-GAAP financial measures”.
We use certain non-GAAP financial measures, including those mentioned above, both to explain our results to shareholders and the investment community and in the internal evaluation and management of our business. Management believes that these supplementary non-GAAP financial measures and the information they provide are useful to investors since these measures permit investors to view our performance using the same tools that our management uses to evaluate our past performance and prospects for future performance. These non-GAAP financial measures have been adjusted for the effect of non-core banking activities such as the sale of loans and securities, the Amerant Mortgage downsizing, the Houston Transaction, the valuation of securities, derivatives, loans held for sale and other real estate owned and repossessed assets. While we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating our performance, this information should be considered as supplemental and not as a substitute for or superior to the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from similar measures presented by other companies.

Financial Condition - Comparison of Financial Condition as of June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024
Assets. 
Total assets were $10.3 billion  as of June 30, 2025, an increase of $432.9 million, or 4.4%, compared to $9.9 billion at December 31, 2024. This result was primarily driven by increases of: (i) $473.0 million, or 31.6%, in total securities, mainly debt securities available for sale and trading securities; (ii) $46.5 million, or 7.9%, in cash and cash equivalents; (iii) $11.9 million, or 4.9%, in BOLI mainly driven by a newly purchased policy and the change in cash surrender values during the first half of 2025. The increases were partially offset by decreases of: (i) $83.7 million, or 1.2%, in total loans held for investment and loans held for sale, net of the ACL; and (ii)  $14.4 million, or 8.1%, in accrued interest receivable and other assets. 
See
 “-Average Balance Sheet, Interest and Yield/Rate Analysis” for detailed information, including changes in the composition of our interest-earning assets.
Cash and Cash Equivalents. 
Cash and cash equivalents increased to $636.8 million at June 30, 2025 from $590.4 million at December 31, 2024, primarily as a result of an increase in interest earning cash balances.
At June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, interest earning deposits with banks, mainly cash balances held at the Federal Reserve, were $573.4 million and $519.9 million, respectively. In addition, at June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the Company’s cash and cash equivalents included restricted cash of $8.0 million and $24.4 million, respectively, which was held primarily to cover margin calls on derivative transactions with certain brokers. Furthermore, at June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the Company’s cash and cash equivalents included other short-term investments of $7.1 million and $6.9 million, respectively, which consist of US Treasury Bills that mature in 90 days or less. 
Cash and cash equivalents provided by operating activities were $77.8 million in the six months ended June 30, 2025, mainly driven by: (i) net sales of $30.8 million in loans held for sale at a fair value; (ii) a non-cash adjustment of $24.5 million for the provision for credit losses, and (iii) net income of $35.0 million. These results were partially offset by a net decrease of $9.2 million in operating assets and liabilities and other non-cash adjustments of $3.3 million. 
Net cash used in investing activities was $425.2 million during the six months ended June 30, 2025, mainly driven by: (i) purchases of investment securities totaling $546.3 million, mainly comprised of debt securities available for sale and trading securities; (ii) proceeds from the sale of loans originated for investment of $24.6 million, and (iii) purchases of BOLI of  $7.0 million. These disbursements were partially offset by: (i) maturities, sales, calls and paydowns of investment securities totaling $93.5 million; and (ii) a net decrease in loans originated for investment of $11.0 million.
88
In the six months ended June 30, 2025, net cash provided by financing activities was $393.8 million, mainly due to: (i) an increase in total demand, savings and money market deposit balances of $523.5 million, and (ii) net proceeds from advances from the FHLB of $20.0 million.This was partially offset by: (i) a net decrease of $71.5 million in time deposits; (ii) the redemption of $60.0 million of senior notes that were due June 30, 2025; (iii) an aggregate of $10.0 million of Class A common stock repurchased in the six months ended June 30, 2025; and (iv) $7.7 million of dividends declared and paid by the Company in the six months ended June 30, 2025.

As of June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the Company had no loans carried at the lower of cost or fair value. In the first quarter of 2025, the Company transferred a loan of $40.6 million from loans held for investment to to held for sale, at the lower of cost or fair value, and no valuation allowance was recorded as part of this transaction.  In April 2025, the Company determined that it no longer plans the sale of this loan and, therefore, in April 2025, reclassified the loan to its held for investment loan portfolio.
 As of June 30, 2025, total loans held for investment were $7.2 billion, down $45.3 million, or 0.6%, compared to December 31, 2024. Domestic loans held for investment decreased $40.1 million, or 0.6%, as of June 30, 2025, compared to December 31, 2024. The decrease in total domestic loans held for investment includes: (i)  $185.2 million, or 10.6%, in domestic commercial loans; (ii) $24.5 million, or 9.0%, in domestic consumer loans, mainly purchased indirect consumer loans as the Company discontinued purchases of these loans in 2023 and this portfolio is set to runoff over time; (iii) $24.0 million, or 2.4%, in domestic owner occupied loans, and (iv) $13.5 million, or 7.9% in loans to financial institutions and acceptances. These decreases were partially offset by a net increases of: (i) $187.9 million, or 7.5% in domestic CRE loans; and (ii) $19.1 million, or 1.3% in domestic single-family residential loans. 
In the six months ended June 30, 2025, the Company has added approximately $90.0 million in single-family residential and construction loans through Amerant Mortgage, which includes loans originated and purchased from different channels.
 Loans to international customers, primarily from Venezuela and other customers in Latin America decreased $5.1 million, or 12.6%, in the six months ended June 30, 2025, mainly driven by repayments totaling $4.8 million to existing single family residential loans. 
  As of 
June 30, 2025
, loans under syndication facilities, included in loans held for investment, were 
$379.9 million
, a decrease of 
$13.8 million
, or 
3.5%
, compared to $393.7 million at 
December 31, 2024
. This was mainly driven by the paydown of five commercial loans totaling $40.9 million partially offset by an increase of four construction loans, three commercial loan totaling $18.4 million and $11.5 million, respectively, and other minor balance changes totaling $2.8 million. As of 
June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024
, there were no SNC loans that financed highly leveraged transactions.

Loan Quality
Allocation of Allowance for Credit Losses
In the following table, we present the allocation of the ACL by loan segment at the end of the periods presented. The amounts shown in this table should not be interpreted as an indication that charge-offs in future periods will occur in these amounts or percentages. These amounts represent our best estimates of expected credit losses to be collected throughout the life of the loans, at the reported dates, derived from historical events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts at the dates reported. Our allowance for credit losses is established using estimates and judgments, which consider the views of our regulators in their periodic examinations. Re-evaluation of the ACL estimate in future periods, in light of changes in composition and characteristics of the loan portfolio, changes in the reasonable and supportable forecast and other factors then prevailing may result in material changes in the amount of the ACL and credit loss expense in those future periods. We also show the percentage of each loan class, which includes loans in nonaccrual status.

The decrease in nonperforming loans during the six months ended June 30, 2025 was primarily due to loan charge offs, repayments and sales. The Company also sold two OREO properties in the period.  These results were partially offset primarily by downgrades based on receipt of year-end 2024 financials. 
See discussion on Classified and Special Mention Loans below for more details.
We recognized no interest income on nonaccrual loans during the six months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024.

Classified loans increased $49.0 million, or 29.4%, primarily due to: (i) 3 CRE loan totaling $41.6 million downgraded to substandard accrual due to the loss of tenants and delays in repositioning plan, and (ii) 9 loans totaling $68.8 million downgraded to non-performing loan status, based on receipt of year-end 2024 and first quarter 2025 financials. The remaining downgrades included other smaller classified loans. These results were partially offset by charge offs and paydowns during the period.
Classified loans include 9 loans totaling $134.4 million that remain in accruing status. Classified accruing loans include: (i) $21.3 million in a CRE loan to a customer in the hospitality service sector in Florida; (ii) $33.2 million CRE retail property loans; (iii) $8.3 in a CRE multifamily loan in New York; (iv) $31.1 million in three commercial loans in the restaurant and transportation industry; and (v) a $40.5 million owner-occupied loan to a customer in the restaurant service sector in Florida.
In July 2025, the Company downgraded to substandard accrual a total of $55.6 million, which included one CRE loan from Pass, one CRE loan from Special Mention, and two commercial loans from Pass. Additionally, the Company collected a total of $53.0 million in full satisfaction, which included two CRE accruing loans and one commercial non-performing loan. There were no additional charges as a result of this activity.
In February 2025, the Company decided to sell the aforementioned $40.6 million substandard accruing owner-occupied loan. The Company transferred this loan from loans held for investment to loans held for sale, at the lower of cost or fair value, and determined no valuation allowance was required at the time of the transfer. In April 2025, the Company determined that it no longer plans the sale of this loan and, therefore, in April 2025, reclassified the loan to its held for investment loan portfolio.
Special Mention Loans.

All special mention loans remained current at June 30, 2025.
The increase in Special mention loans was primarily driven by 8 commercial loans in multiple industries totaling $80.3 million. These commercial loans were downgraded based on receipt of year-end 2024 and first quarter 2025 financials. In addition, the increase in special mention loans include seven CRE  loans totaling $91.3 million. While certain milestones were missed by the borrowers, there are acceptable mitigating factors in place, such as adequate loan-to-value, interest reserves or other structural enhancements. These increases were partially offset by  $16.8 million in upgrades to Pass, $25.4 million in payoffs and $20.6 million in downgrades to Substandard.
Potential problem loans, which are accruing loans classified as substandard and are less than 90 days past due, at June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, are as follows:

__________________
(1)   Issued by a financial institution.
(2)    In 2023, the Company purchased an investment in an open-end fund incorporated in the U.S. with an original cost of $2.5 million. The Fund’s objective is to provide a high level of current income consistent with the preservation of capital and investments deemed to be qualified under the Community Reinvestment Act.
(3)    In the three months ended June 30, 2025, the Company began participating in trading of MBS as part of its investment portfolio strategy.
(4)    Includes investments in FHLB and Federal Reserve stock. Amounts correspond to original cost at the date presented. Original cost approximates fair value because of the nature of these investments.
As of June 30, 2025, total securities increased $473.0 million, or 31.6%, to $1.97 billion compared to $1.50 billion at December 31, 2024. The increase in the six months ended June 30, 2025 was mainly driven by: (i) purchases of debt securities held for sale, trading securities and FHLB stock totaling $546.3 million; and (ii) net pre-tax unrealized gains of $19.4 million on debt securities available for sale primarily attributable to changes in market interest rates during the current period . This increase was partially offset by: maturities, sales, calls and pay downs, totaling $93.5 million.
99
Debt securities available for sale had net unrealized holding losses of $39.1 million and net unrealized holding gains of $3.7 million at June 30, 2025, compared to December 31, 2024 when net unrealized holding losses were $55.7 million and net unrealized holding gains were $0.9 million.  The Company does not intend to sell these debt securities and it is more likely than not that it will not be required to sell the securities before their anticipated recovery. The Company believes these securities are not credit-impaired because the change in fair value is attributable to changes in interest rates and investment securities markets, generally, and not credit quality. As a result, the Company did not record an ACL on these securities as of June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024.
The Company does not have any debt securities classified as held to maturity at June 30, 2025.
 The following tables set forth the book value, scheduled maturities and weighted average yields for our securities portfolio at June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024. Similar to the table above, the book value for securities available for sale, trading securities and equity securities with readily determinable fair value not held for trading is equal to fair market value and the book value for debt securities held to maturity is equal to amortized cost less an ACL if required.

The investment portfolio’s weighted expected average effective duration decreased to 4.4 years at June 30, 2025  compared to 5.2 years at December 31, 2024, due to higher prepayment assumptions due to projections of lower market rates, and higher composition of variable-rate investments that result in a lower weighted average duration.

Liabilities
Total liabilities were $9.41 billion at June 30, 2025, an increase of $399.1 million, or 4.4%, compared to $9.0 billion at December 31, 2024. This was primarily driven by an increase of  $451.9 million, or 5.8%, in total deposits, mainly due to an increase in core deposits, and (ii) $20.0 million, or 2.7%, in advances from the FHLB. This increase was partially offset by: (i) the redemption of $60 million of senior notes that were due June 30, 2025; and (ii)  $16.2 million, or 10.7%, in accounts payable, accrued liabilities and other liabilities. 
See
 “Capital Resources and Liquidity Management” and “Deposits” for more details on the changes in advances from the FHLB and total deposits. 
See
 “Our Company- Business Developments” for additional information.
Deposits 
We continue with our efforts in growing our deposits. Our efforts include the additions of new team members to our business development teams across South Florida and Tampa in the first six months of 2025. 
Total deposits were $8.31 billion at June 30, 2025, an increase of $451.9 million, or 5.8%, compared to December 31, 2024. The increase in deposits in the six months ended June 30, 2025 was mainly due to an increase of: (i) $269.5 million, or 14.3%, in savings and money market deposits; (ii) $201.8 million, or 13.4%, in noninterest bearing demand deposits; and (iii) $52.1 million, or 2.3%, in interest-bearing deposits. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $71.5 million, or 3.2%, in time deposits.
The $71.5 million, or 3.2%, net decrease in time deposits includes decreases of: (i) $67.0 million, or 9.5%, in brokered time deposits; and (ii) $4.5 million, or 0.3% in customer CDs.
As of June 30, 2025 total brokered deposits were $644.0 million, a decrease of $57.9 million, or 8.3%, compared to $701.9 million at December 31, 2024.

(1)    Includes brokered deposits of $644.0 million and $701.9 million at June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively.
(2)    Based upon the diligence we customarily perform to "know our customers" for anti-money laundering, OFAC and sanctions purposes, we believe that the U.S. economic embargo on certain Venezuelan persons will not adversely affect our Venezuelan customer relationships, generally.
(3)    Our other foreign deposits do not include deposits from Venezuelan resident customers.
102
Our domestic deposits increased $429.0 million, or 8.1%, in the six months ended June 30, 2025, primarily driven by increases of: (i) $241.5 million in savings and money market accounts; (ii) $197.4 million in domestic noninterest bearing accounts; and (iii) $82.8 million in domestic interest bearing accounts. These increases were partially offset by decreases of: (i)  $77.0 million in domestic brokered time deposits; and (ii) $15.7 million in domestic customer time deposits.
During the six months ended June 30, 2025, total foreign deposits increased $23.0 million, or 0.9%, primarily driven by an increase of $14.7 million, or 2.1%, in deposits from countries other than Venezuela, mostly savings and money market and time deposits. In addition, there was an increase of $8.3 million, or 0.4%, in deposits from customers domiciled in Venezuela, mostly in time deposits. 
 Core Deposits 
 Our core deposits were $6.1 billion and $5.6 billion as of June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively. Core deposits represented 74.0% and 71.6% of our total deposits at those dates, respectively. The increase of $523.5 million, or 9.3%, in core deposits in the six months ended June 30, 2025 was mainly driven by increases in savings and money market deposits, noninterest bearing demand deposits as well as interest bearing demand deposits. We define “core deposits” as total deposits excluding all time deposits.
 Brokered Deposits 
We utilize brokered deposits primarily as an asset/liability management tool. As of June 30, 2025, we had $644.0 million in brokered deposits, which represented 7.8% of our total deposits at that date (8.9% as of December 31, 2024). As of June 30, 2025, brokered deposits decreased $57.9 million, or 8.3%, compared to $701.9 million as of December 31, 2024, mainly due to maturities of brokered time deposits, partially offset by an increase in brokered non-time deposits during the period. As of June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, brokered deposits included time deposits of $634.9 million and $701.9 million, respectively. As of June 30, 2025, there were $9.1 million in brokered non-time deposits which consists of an aggregate of $8.1 million interest bearing demand and money market brokered deposits and $1.0 million in noninterest bearing brokered deposits, while there were no brokered non-time deposits as of December 31, 2024. The Company has not historically sold brokered CDs in individual denominations over $100,000.
 Large Fund Providers 
Large fund providers consist of third party relationships with balances over $20 million. At June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, our large fund providers included 17 and 20 deposit relationships, respectively, with total balances of $1.1 billion and $942.3 million, respectively. The increase in balances from large fund providers in the six months ended June 30, 2025 was mainly driven by an increase in large deposits from commercial customers  as the Company continues its focus on depository relationships.

Short-Term Borrowings
In addition to deposits, we use short-term borrowings from time to time, such as advances from the FHLB and borrowings from other banks, as a source of funds to meet the daily liquidity needs of our customers and fund growth in earning assets. Short-term borrowings have maturities of 12 months or less as of the reported period-end. 
Short-term borrowings outstanding at June 30, 2025 matured in July 2025 (balance outstanding at December 31, 2024 matured in January 2025). All of our outstanding short-term borrowings at December 31, 2024 corresponded to advances from the FHLB. There were no other borrowings or repurchase agreements outstanding at June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024.

In the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, potential dilutive instruments consisted of unvested shares of restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance share units. S

 Note 13 to our unaudited interim consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q for details on the dilutive effects of the issuance of restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance share units on earnings per share for the six month periods ended June 30, 2025 and 2024. 
 
During the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2025, basic and diluted earnings per share increased compared to the same period one year ago, primarily driven by improved net income in the current periods compared to the same periods last year. These results were partially offset by an increase in the weighted average number of shares as a result of the Company’s public offering of its Class A common stock that was completed in September 2024.
Capital Resources and Liquidity Management
Capital Resources 
Stockholders’ equity is influenced primarily by earnings, dividends, if any, and changes in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss (AOCI/AOCL) caused primarily by fluctuations in unrealized holding gains or losses, net of taxes, on debt securities available for sale and derivative instruments. AOCI or AOCL are not included in stockholders’ equity for purposes of determining our capital for bank regulatory purposes.
Total stockholders’ equity was $924.3 million as of June 30, 2025, an increase of $33.8 million, or 3.8%, compared to $890.5 million as of December 31, 2024. This increase was primarily driven by: (i) a net income of $35.0 million in the first six months of 2025, and (ii) $14.4 million of other comprehensive income in the first half of 2025. This was partially offset by: (i) an aggregate of $10.0 million of Class A common stock repurchased in the first six months of 2025, and (ii) $7.7 million of dividends declared and paid by the Company in the first six months of 2025.
105
Common Stock Transactions
In the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2025, the Company repurchased an aggregate of 275,666 and 491,093 shares, respectively, of Class A common stock at a weighted average price of $18.14 and $20.36 per share at those , under the 2023 Class A Common Stock Repurchase Program. The aggregate purchase price for these transactions was $5.0 million and $10.0 million in the three and six months ended June 30, 2025, including transaction costs.

On July 23, 2025, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.09 per share of the Company’s common stock. The dividend is payable on August 29, 2025, to shareholders of record at the close of business on August 15, 2025.
Liquidity Management
We manage our liquidity based on several factors that include the amount of core deposit relationships as a percentage of total deposits, the level of diversification of our funding sources, the allocation and amount of our deposits among deposit types, the short-term funding sources used to fund assets, the amount of non-deposit funding used to fund assets, the availability of unused funding sources, off-balance sheet obligations, the amount of cash and liquid securities we hold, the availability of assets readily convertible into cash without undue loss, the characteristics and maturities of our assets when compared to the characteristics of our liabilities and other factors.
 
Liquidity risk management is a relevant element of our asset/liability management. Our contingency funding plan is constantly monitored by our Assets and Liabilities Committee and serves as the basis to identify our liquidity needs. The contingency funding plan models several liquidity stress scenarios to evaluate different potential liquidity outflows or funding gaps resulting from economic disruptions and volatility in the financial markets, among other factors.
Customer deposits have been our principal source of funding, supplemented by our investment securities portfolio, our short-term and long-term borrowings as well as loan repayments and amortizations.
 
The Company’s liquidity position includes cash and cash equivalents of $636.8 million at June 30, 2025, compared to $590.4 million at December 31, 2024.
At June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the Company had $765.0 million and $745.0 million, respectively, of outstanding advances from the FHLB. At June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, we had an additional $1.9 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, of remaining borrowing capacity with the FHLB. This additional borrowing capacity is determined by the FHLB. In the six months ended June 30, 2025, the Company borrowed $50.0 million and repaid $30.0 million in advances from the FHLB. In the six months ended June 30, 2025, the Company had no significant gains or losses on the repayments of the advances from the FHLB. These repayments are part of the Company’s asset/liability management strategies.
106
There were no other borrowings as of June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024.
We also have available uncommitted federal funds lines with several banks. We had no outstanding borrowings under uncommitted federal funds lines with banks at June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024. 
Holding Company
We are a corporation separate and apart from the Bank and, therefore, must provide for our own liquidity. Historically, our main source of funding has been dividends declared and paid to us by the Bank. The Company is the obligor and guarantor on our junior subordinated debt and the guarantor of the Subordinated Notes.
The Company held cash and cash equivalents mainly at the Bank of $11.6 million as of June 30, 2025 in funds available to service Subordinated Notes and junior subordinated debt and for general corporate purposes, as a separate stand-alone entity ($99.5 million as of December 31, 2024 in funds available to service Subordinated Notes, Senior Notes and junior subordinated debt and for general corporate purposes).
On April 1, 2025, the Company redeemed $60.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 5.75% Senior Notes that were due June 30, 2025. The Notes were redeemed in full at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The aggregate redemption price, including accrued interest, totaled approximately $60.9 million.
Subsidiary Dividends 
There are statutory and regulatory limitations that affect the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to the Company. These limitations exclude the effects of AOCI/AOCL. Management believes that these limitations will not affect the Company’s ability to meet its ongoing short-term cash obligations. See “Supervision and Regulation” in the 2024 Form 10-K. 
In July 2025, the Board of Directors of the Bank approved the payment of a cash dividend of $40.0 million by the Bank to the Company.
Based on our current outlook, we believe that net income, advances from the FHLB, available other borrowings and any dividends paid to us by the Bank will be sufficient to fund liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future.

Contractual Obligations
In the normal course of business, we and our subsidiaries enter into various contractual obligations that may require future cash payments. Significant commitments for future cash obligations include capital expenditures related to operating leases, certain binding agreements we have entered into for services including outsourcing of technology services, advertising and other services, and other borrowing arrangements which are not material to our liquidity needs. We currently anticipate that our available funds, credit facilities, and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our operational cash needs for the foreseeable future. Other than the changes discussed herein, there have been no material changes to the contractual obligations previously disclosed in the 2024 Form 10-K.
In the six months ended June 30, 2025, the Company redeemed $60.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 5.75% senior notes that were due June 30, 2025.
In the six months ended June 30, 2025, the Company borrowed $50.0 million and repaid $30.0 million of FHLB advances.
In the six months ended June 30, 2025, total time deposits decreased $71.5 million, or 3.2%.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
 
 We believe interest rate and price risks are the most significant market risks impacting us. We monitor and evaluate these risks using sensitivity analyses to measure the effects on earnings, equity and the available for sale portfolio mark-to-market exposure, of changes in market interest rates. Exposures are managed to a set of limits previously approved by our Board of Directors and monitored by management. See discussions below for material changes in our market risk exposure as compared to those discussed in our 2024 Form 10-K, Part II, Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk”.

__________________
(1)    Represents the change in net interest income, and the percentage that change represents of the base scenario net interest income. The base scenario assumes (i) flat interest rates over the next 12 months, (ii) that total financial instrument balances are kept constant over time and (iii) that interest rate shocks are instant and parallel to the yield curve, for the various interest rates and indices that affect our net interest income.
Net interest income in the base scenario increased to approximately $371.0 million in the six months ended June 30, 2025 compared to $361.0 million as of December 31, 2024. This increase is mainly due to (i) the growth in the size of the balance sheet as total assets increased $432.9 million, or 4.4%, in the first six months of 2025 compared to December 31, 2024; and (ii) a decrease in the cost of total deposits and borrowings.
The Company periodically reviews the scenarios used for earnings sensitivity to reflect market conditions.

The estimated average effective duration of our investment portfolio decreased to 4.4 years at June 30, 2025 compared to 5.2 years at December 31, 2024, due to higher prepayment assumptions due to projections of lower market rates and higher composition of variable-rate investments that result in a lower weighted average duration.
Additionally, the floating rate portfolio increased to 19%  at June 30, 2025 from 16.8% at December 31, 2024.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
The Company maintains a set of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. The CEO and the CFO, with assistance from other members of management, have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30, 2025, and, based on their evaluation, have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of such date.
Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures
In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the period covered by this Form 10-Q that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
