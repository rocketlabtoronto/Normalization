Forward-Looking Statements
In this Annual Report on Form 10-K for Brady Corporation (âBrady,â âCompany,â âwe,â âus,â or âourâ), statements that are not reported financial results or other historic information are âforward-looking statements.â These forward-looking statements relate to, among other things, the Company's future financial position, business strategy, targets, projected sales, costs, income, capital expenditures, debt levels and cash flows, and plans and objectives of management for future operations.
The use of words such as âmay,â âwill,â âexpect,â âintend,â âestimate,â âanticipate,â âbelieve,â âshould,â âprojectâ or âplanâ or similar terminology are generally intended to identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements by their nature address matters that are, to different degrees, uncertain and are subject to risks, assumptions, and other factors, some of which are beyond Brady's control, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. For Brady, uncertainties arise from:
â¢
Increased cost of materials, labor, material shortages and supply chain disruptions, including as a result of tariffs or other impacts of the global trade environmentÂ Â Â Â 
â¢
Decreased demand for the Company's products
â¢
Ability to compete effectively or to successfully execute the Company's strategy
â¢
Ability to develop technologically advanced products that meet customer demands
â¢
Ability to identify, integrate, and grow acquired companies, and to manage contingent liabilities from divested businesses
â¢
Difficulties in protecting websites, networks, and systems against security breaches and difficulties in preventing phishing attacks, social engineering or malicious break-ins
â¢
Extensive regulations by U.S. and non-U.S. governmental and self-regulatory entities
â¢
Risks associated with the loss of key employees
â¢
Litigation, including product liability claims
â¢
Global climate change and environmental regulations
â¢
Foreign currency fluctuations
â¢
Changes in tax legislation and tax rates
â¢
Potential write-offs of goodwill and other intangible assets
â¢
Differing interests of voting and non-voting shareholders and changes in the regulatory and business environment around dual-class voting structures
â¢
Numerous other matters of national, regional and global scale, including major public health crises and government responses thereto and those of a political, economic, business, competitive, and regulatory nature contained from time to time in Brady's U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (âSECâ) filings, including, but not limited to, those factors listed in the âRisk Factorsâ section within Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K
These uncertainties may cause Brady's actual future results to be materially different than those expressed in its forward-looking statements. Brady does not undertake to update its forward-looking statements except as required by law.

Business
General Development of Business
Brady was incorporated under the laws of the state of Wisconsin in 1914. Brady is a global manufacturer and supplier of identification solutions and workplace safety products that identify and protect premises, products and people. The ability to provide customers with a broad range of proprietary, customized and diverse products for use in various applications across multiple industries and geographies, along with a commitment to quality and service, have made Brady a leader in many of its markets.

The Company manufactures differentiated, proprietary products, most of which have been internally developed. These internally developed products include materials, printing and identification systems, tracking systems, and software. Materials manufactured by the Company generally require a high degree of precision and the application of adhesives with chemical and physical properties suited for specific uses. The Companyâs manufacturing processes include compounding, coating, converting, printing, melt-blown operations, software development and printer design and assembly.
Competition is based upon several factors, including product innovation, customer service, breadth of product offering, product quality, price, expertise, production capabilities, and for multinational customers, our global footprint. Competition is highly fragmented, ranging from smaller companies offering minimal product variety, to some of the world's largest adhesive and electrical product companies offering competing products as part of their overall product lines.
These products serve customers in many industries within each reportable segment, of which those industries include industrial manufacturing, electronic manufacturing, healthcare, chemical, oil, gas, alternative energy, automotive, aerospace, governments, mass transit, mechanical contractors, construction, utilities, education, leisure and entertainment, retail and telecommunications, among others.
Research and Development
The Company focuses its R&D efforts on identification and printing systems, track and trace applications, pressure sensitive materials, software, and the development of other innovative workplace safety-related products. The Company incurred $79.9 million, $67.7 million, and $61.4 million of expense on its R&D activities during the years ended JulyÂ 31, 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively. The majority of R&D spend supports the Company's identification products. Material development involves the application of surface chemistry concepts for top coatings and adhesives applied to a variety of base materials. The design of our identification and printing systems integrates materials, embedded software, a variety of printing technologies and product scanning and identification technologies to form a complete solution for customer applications. In addition, R&D supports production and marketing efforts by providing application and technical expertise.
The Company owns patents and tradenames relating to certain products in the United States and internationally. Although the Company believes patents are a significant driver in maintaining its position for certain products, technology in the areas covered by many of the patents continues to evolve and may limit the value of such patents. The Company's business is not dependent on any single patent or group of patents. Patents applicable to specific products extend for up to 20 years according to the date of patent application filing or patent grant, depending upon the legal term of patents in the various countries where 
5
Table

patent protection is obtained. The Company's tradenames are generally valid ten years from the date of registration, and are typically renewed on an ongoing basis.
Operations
The materials used in the products manufactured by the Company consist of a variety of plastic and synthetic films, paper, metal and metal foil, cloth, fiberglass, inks, dyes, adhesives, pigments, natural and synthetic rubber, organic chemicals, polymers, and solvents for consumable identification products in addition to molded parts, electronic components, chips, and sub-assemblies for identification and printing systems. The Company operates coating facilities that manufacture bulk rolls of label stock for internal and external customers. In addition, the Company purchases finished products for resale.
The Company purchases raw materials, components and finished products from many suppliers. Overall, we are not dependent upon any single supplier for our most critical base materials or components. However, we have chosen in certain situations to sole source, or limit the sources of materials, components, or finished items for design or cost reasons. As a result, disruptions in supply could have an impact on results for a period of time, but we believe most disruptions would simply require qualification of new suppliers and the disruption would be modest. In certain instances, the qualification process could be more costly or take a longer period of time and in certain situations, such as a global shortage of critical materials or components, the financial impact could be material.
The Company carries working capital mainly related to accounts receivable and inventory. Inventory consists of raw materials, work in process and finished goods. Generally, custom products are made to order while an on-hand quantity of stock product is maintained to provide customers with timely delivery. Average time to fulfill customer orders varies from same-day to one month, depending on the type of product, customer request, and whether the product is stock or custom-designed and manufactured. Normal and customary payment terms primarily range from net 10 to 90 days from date of invoice and vary by geography.
The Company has a broad customer base, and no individual customer represents 10% or more of total net sales.
Human Capital Management
As of JulyÂ 31, 2025, the Company employed approximately 6,400 individuals worldwide, of which approximately 1,700 were employed in the United States and approximately 4,700 were employed outside the United States.
The Companyâs Vice President of Human Resources is responsible for developing the Companyâs human capital strategy, which includes the attraction, acquisition, development, engagement and retention of talent to deliver on the Companyâs strategy as well as the design of employee compensation and benefits programs. Management is responsible for executing the Company's human capital strategy. The Vice President of Human Resources is also responsible for enhancing the Companyâs high-performance culture, which rewards execution and fosters inclusion, to drive differential performance and execute our strategy for the organization. The Companyâs Board of Directors and its committees receive regular updates on the operation and status of these initiatives and human capital trends and activities from the Vice President of Human Resources, the CEO and others within senior management.
Key areas of focus with respect to human capital include:
Health and Safety
: The Companyâs health and safety programs are designed around global standards with appropriate variations addressing the multiple jurisdictions and regulations, specific hazards and unique working environments of the Companyâs manufacturing, distribution and headquarter operations. The Company requires each of its locations to perform regular safety audits to ensure proper safety policies, program procedures, analyses and trainings are in place. The Company utilizes a mixture of leading and lagging indicators to assess the health and safety performance of its operations. Lagging indicators include the OSHA Total Recordable Incident Rate (âTRIRâ) and the Lost Time Case Rate (âLTCRâ) based upon the number of incidents per 100 employees. Leading indicators include reporting and closure of all near miss events. The Company also utilizes trainings such as Environmental, Health and Safety (âEHSâ) coaching and engagement conversations as preventative measures. During the year ended JulyÂ 31, 2025, the Company had a TRIR of 0.43, a LTCR of 0.23 and no work-related fatalities.
Inclusive Workplace
: The Company prioritizes fostering an inclusive workplace where employees feel valued and heard. This commitment is central to our ability to leverage the full strengths of our workforce, aiming to exceed customer expectations and achieve growth objectives. To support this, the Company engages employees through various employee resource groups. These groups bring together employees to share common interests in personal and professional development, while improving corporate culture and delivering business results. Senior leaders throughout the organization sponsor and support each employee resource group.

Table
 of Contents
The Company also strives to build a robust talent pipeline by partnering with its business units in their workforce planning to develop initiatives and goals to recruit talent from all backgrounds across defined organizational levels and skill areas. The Company trains its recruiting workforce in sourcing strategies aimed at broadening its talent pool and partners with external organizations that develop and supply a wide range of talent. As a commitment to an inclusive workplace, the Company supports the unique input of individuals at all levels within the organization. As of JulyÂ 31, 2025, 45% of the members of the Companyâs Board of Directors were women and 60% of Board committee chairs were women. 
Training and Talent Development
: The Company is committed to the continued development of its people. Strategic talent reviews and succession planning occur on a planned cadence annually. The CEO and the Vice President of Human Resources convene meetings with senior Company leadership and the Board of Directors to review top enterprise talent and discuss succession planning for key leadership roles. The Company also emphasizes career development planning to support employee growth and progression across a wide range of roles and functions.
The Company provides technical training to employees, customers and suppliers who work for or with the Companyâs products. Training is provided in a variety of formats to accommodate the respective learnerâs style, pace, location, technical knowledge and access.
Compensation and Benefits:
 The Company values its people and strives to deliver compensation and benefit programs and plans that are competitive with the external market. The Company provides subsidized health and welfare benefits, as well as postretirement, incentive and equity-based compensation plans and programs to eligible employees. Refer to the Compensation Discussion & Analysis for additional information regarding the Companyâs compensation and benefits programs.

The Companyâs Corporate Internet address is www.bradyid.com. The Company makes available, free of charge, on or through its website, copies of its Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to all such reports as soon as reasonably practicable after such reports are electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC. The Company is not including the information contained on or available through its website as part of, or incorporating such information by reference into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
ItemÂ 1A.
 
Risk Factors
Investors should carefully consider the risks set forth below and all other information contained in this report and other documents we file with the SEC. The risks and uncertainties described below are those that we have identified as material, but are not the only risks and uncertainties facing us. Our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies, such as market conditions, geopolitical events, changes in laws or accounting rules, fluctuations in interest rates, terrorism, wars or conflicts, major health concerns, natural disasters or other disruptions of expected economic or business conditions. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business and financial results.
Business Risks
Raw material and other cost inflation as well as product shortages could adversely affect our business and financial results.
We manufacture certain parts and components of our products and therefore require raw materials from suppliers, which could be interrupted for a variety of reasons, including availability and pricing. Our prices and lead times for raw materials and other components necessary for production have continued to fluctuate over the past year, including increased raw production costs, increased wage rates, and extended lead times. Significant increases could adversely affect our profit margins and results of operations. Changes in trade policies; supply chain disruptions; and the imposition of duties and tariffs and potential retaliatory countermeasures could adversely impact the price or availability of raw materials, which could adversely affect our profit margins and results of operations. In addition, labor shortages or an increase in the cost of labor could adversely affect our profit margins and results of operations. Due to competitive pressures or other factors, we may not be able to pass along increased raw material and component part costs to our customers in the form of price increases or our ability to do so could be delayed, which could adversely impact our business and financial results.
While we have implemented certain cost containment measures and selective price increases, as well as taken other actions to offset recent inflationary pressures in our supply chain, we may not be able to offset all of the increases in our operational costs, which could adversely impact our business and financial results.

If any of these factors occur, the demand for our products could suffer, and this could adversely impact our business and financial results.
Failure to compete effectively or to successfully execute our strategy may have a negative impact on our business and financial results.
We actively compete with companies that produce and market the same or similar products, and in some instances, with companies that sell different products that are designed for the same target markets. Competition may force us to reduce prices or incur additional costs to remain competitive in an environment in which business models, including the development and use of artificial intelligence technologies, are changing rapidly. We compete on the basis of several factors, including customer support, product innovation, product offering, product quality, price, expertise, digital capabilities, production capabilities, and for multinational customers, our global footprint. Present or future competitors may develop and introduce new and enhanced products, offer products based on alternative technologies and processes, accept lower profit, have greater financial, technical or other resources, or have lower production costs or other pricing advantages. Any of these could put us at a disadvantage by threatening our share of sales or reducing our profit margins, which could adversely impact our business and financial results.
Additionally, throughout our global business, distributors and customers may not accept our price increases or may seek lower cost sourcing opportunities, which could result in a loss of business that may adversely impact our business and financial results.
Our strategy is to expand into higher-growth adjacent product categories and markets with technologically advanced new products, as well as to grow our sales generated through the digital channel. While traditional direct marketing channels such as catalogs are an important means of advertising and selling our products, an increasing number of customers are purchasing products online. Our strategy to increase sales through the digital channel is an investment in our e-commerce sales capabilities. There is a risk that we may not continue to successfully implement this strategy, or if successfully implemented, we may not realize its expected benefits due to increased competition and pricing pressure brought about by other e-commerce businesses. Our failure to successfully implement our strategy could adversely impact our business and financial results.
Failure to develop or acquire technologically advanced products that meet customer demands, including price expectations, could adversely impact our business and financial results.
We develop technologically advanced new products to promote our organic growth and profitability. Technology is changing rapidly and our competitors are innovating quickly. If we do not keep pace with developing technologically advanced products, we risk product commoditization, deterioration of the value of our brand, and reduced ability to effectively compete. We must continue to develop innovative products, as well as acquire and retain the necessary intellectual property rights in these products. If we fail to innovate, or we launch products with quality problems, or if customers do not accept our products, then our business and financial results could be adversely affected.
The failure to properly identify, integrate and grow acquired companies, and to manage contingent liabilities from divested businesses could adversely affect our business and financial results.
Our historical growth has included acquisitions and our future growth strategy includes acquisitions. Acquisitions place significant demands on management, operational, and financial resources. Recent and future acquisitions will require integration of operations, sales and marketing, information technology, finance, and administrative operations, which could decrease the time available to focus on our other growth strategies. We cannot assure that we will be able to successfully integrate acquisitions, that these acquisitions will operate profitably, or that we will be able to achieve the desired sales growth

or operational success. Our sales, results of operations, cash flow, and liquidity could be adversely affected if we do not successfully integrate acquired businesses, including realizing synergies, or if our other businesses suffer due to the increased focus on the acquired businesses.
We continually assess the strategic fit of our existing businesses and may divest businesses that we determine do not align with our strategic plan, or that are not achieving the desired return on investment. Divestitures pose risks and challenges that could negatively impact our business. When we decide to sell a business or specific assets, we may be unable to do so on satisfactory terms or within our anticipated timeframe, and even after reaching a definitive agreement to sell a business, the sale is typically subject to pre-closing conditions which may not be satisfied. In addition, the impact of the divestiture on our revenue and net income may be larger than projected, which could distract management, and disputes may arise with buyers. We have retained responsibility for and have agreed to indemnify buyers against certain contingent liabilities related to several businesses that we have sold. The resolution of these contingencies has not had a material adverse impact on our financial results, but we cannot be certain that this pattern will continue.
Global Operating Risks
Our failure or the failure of third-party service providers to protect our sites, networks and systems against security breaches, to protect our confidential information, or to facilitate our digital strategy, could adversely affect our business and financial results. 
Our business systems collect, transmit and store data about our customers, vendors and others, including credit card information and personally identifiable information. We also employ third-party service providers that store, process and transmit proprietary, personal and confidential information on our behalf. We rely on encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties in an effort to securely transmit confidential and sensitive information, including credit card numbers. Our security measures, and those of our third-party service providers, may not detect or prevent all attempts to hack our systems, denial-of-service attacks, viruses, malicious software, break-ins, phishing attacks, social engineering, security breaches or other similar disruptions that may jeopardize the security of information stored in or transmitted by our sites, networks and systems or that we or our third-party service providers otherwise maintain. We engage third-party service providers to assist with certain of our website and digital platform upgrades, which may result in a decline in sales when initially deployed, which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.
We and our service providers may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent all types of attacks, and techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to or to sabotage systems change frequently and may not be known until launched against us or our third-party service providers. In addition, security breaches can also occur as a result of non-technical issues, including intentional or inadvertent breaches by our employees or by persons with whom we have commercial relationships. Although we maintain privacy, data breach and network security liability insurance, we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate or will cover liabilities actually incurred, or that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all. Any compromise or breach of our security measures, or those of our third-party service providers, could adversely impact our ability to conduct business, violate applicable privacy, data security and other laws, and cause significant legal and financial exposure, adverse publicity, and a loss of confidence in our security measures, which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.
We are a global company headquartered in the United States. We are subject to extensive regulations by U.S. and non-U.S. governmental and self-regulatory entities at various levels of the governing bodies. Failure to comply with laws and regulations could adversely affect our business and financial results.
Approximately 50% of our sales are derived outside of the United States. Our operations are subject to the risks of doing business domestically and globally, including the following:
â¢
Imposition of new or changes in existing duties, tariffs and trade agreements, which could have a direct or indirect impact on our ability to manufacture products, on our customers' demand for our products, or on our suppliers' ability to deliver raw materials.
â¢
Delays or disruptions in product deliveries and payments in connection with international manufacturing and sales.
â¢
Regulations resulting from political and economic instability and disruptions.
â¢
Import, export and economic sanction laws.
â¢
Current and changing governmental policies, regulatory, and business environments.
â¢
Disadvantages from competing against companies from countries that are not subject to U.S. laws and regulations including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
â¢
Local labor regulations.
â¢
Regulations relating to climate change, air emissions, wastewater discharges, handling and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes.

â¢
Regulations relating to product content, health, safety and the protection of the environment.
â¢
Imposition of trade or travel restrictions as a result of any effects of pandemics or global health crises.
â¢
Specific country regulations where our products are manufactured or sold.
â¢
Regulations relating to compliance with data protection and privacy laws throughout our global business.
â¢
Laws and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government, including audit requirements of government contracts related to procurement integrity, export control, employment practices, and the accuracy of records and recording of costs.
Further, these laws and regulations are constantly evolving and it is difficult to accurately predict the effect they may have upon our business and financial results.
We cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by employees, agents or business partners that would violate U.S. and/or non-U.S. laws, including the laws governing payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, anti-kickback and false claims rules, competition, export and import compliance, money laundering and data privacy. Any such improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions, lead to substantial civil or criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and related lawsuits by shareholders and others, damage our reputation, and adversely impact our business and financial results.
We depend on key employees and the loss of these individuals could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.
Our financial results could be adversely affected by increased competition for employees, difficulty in recruiting employees, higher employee turnover or increased compensation and benefit costs. Our employees are important to our success and we are dependent on our ability to retain the services of our employees in key roles. We have built our business on a set of core values, and we attempt to hire and retain employees who are committed to these values and our culture of providing exceptional service to our customers. In order to compete and to continue to grow, we must attract, retain and motivate our employees. We need qualified managers and skilled employees with technical and industry experience to operate our business successfully. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified individuals, or if our costs to do so increase significantly, or if internal realignment of responsibilities are not executed properly, our business and financial results could be adversely affected.
We are subject to litigation that could adversely impact our business, financial results, and reputation.
We are, or may become, a party to litigation that arises in the normal course of our business operations, including product liability and recall (strict liability and negligence) claims, patent and trademark matters, contract disputes and environmental, employment and other litigation matters. We face an inherent risk that our competitors will allege that aspects of our products infringe their intellectual property or that our intellectual property is invalid, such that we could be prevented from manufacturing and selling our products or prevented from stopping others from manufacturing and selling competing products. We face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products is alleged to have resulted in injury or other damage. To date, we have not incurred material costs related to these types of claims. However, while we currently maintain insurance coverage for certain types of claims that we believe is adequate, we cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable terms or that this insurance will provide sufficient coverage against potential liabilities that may arise. Any claims brought against us, with or without merit, may have an adverse effect on our business, financial results and reputation as a result of potential adverse outcomes. The expenses associated with defending such claims and the diversion of our managementâs resources and time may have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.
Global climate change and related emphasis on environmental matters by various stakeholders could negatively affect our business and financial results.
Increased public awareness and concern regarding global climate change may result in more regional and/or federal requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gas emissions. There continues to be a lack of consistent climate legislation, which creates economic and regulatory uncertainty. Further, our customers and the markets we serve may impose emissions or other environmental standards through regulation, market-based emissions policies or consumer preference that we may not be able to timely meet due to the required level of capital investment or technological advancement. 
Additionally, the enhanced stakeholder focus on Environmental, Social and Governance (âESGâ) issues relating to our business requires the continuous monitoring of various and evolving standards and the associated reporting requirements. A failure to adequately meet stakeholder expectations may result in the loss of business, diluted market valuation, an inability to attract customers or an inability to attract and retain top talent.

Financial and Security Ownership Risks
The global nature of our business exposes us to foreign currency fluctuations that could adversely affect our business and financial results.
Approximately 50% o
f our sales are derived outside the United States. Sales and purchases in currencies other than the U.S. dollar expos
e us to fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, and may adversely affect our financial results. Increased strength of the U.S. dollar could increase the effective price of our products sold in currencies other than U.S. dollars into other countries. Decreased strength of the U.S. dollar could adversely affect the cost of materials, products, and services purchased overseas. Our sales and expenses are translated into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes, and further strengthening of the U.S. dollar could result in unfavorable translation effects. In addition, certain of our subsidiaries may invoice customers in a currency other than its functional currency or may be invoiced by suppliers in a currency other than its functional currency, which could result in unfavorable translation effects on our business and financial results.
Changes in tax legislation or tax rates could adversely affect results of operations and financial statements. Additionally, audits by taxing authorities could result in tax payments for prior periods.
We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and in many non-U.S. jurisdictions. As such, our income is subject to risk due to changing tax laws and tax rates around the world. Our tax filings are subject to audit by U.S. federal, state and local tax authorities and by non-U.S. tax authorities. If these audits result in payments or assessments that differ from our reserves, our future net income may be adversely impacted.
On July 4, 2025, the U.S. government enacted tax legislation commonly referred to as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (âOBBBAâ). The OBBBA made permanent or extended several provisions from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, including restoration of 100% bonus depreciation, an EBITDA-based limitation on interest expense deductions, and immediate expensing of domestic research and development expenditures. Future changes to these or other tax laws, as well as related regulations and interpretations, could materially affect our financial results. 
We review the probability of the realization of our deferred tax assets quarterly based on forecasts of taxable income in both the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. As part of this review, we utilize historical results, projected future operating results, eligible carry-forward periods, tax planning opportunities, and other relevant considerations. Changes in profitability and financial outlook in both the U.S. and/or foreign jurisdictions, or changes in our geographic footprint may require modifications in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets.
Globally, many countries have enacted, or plan to enact, legislation and other guidance to align with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Developmentâs (âOECDâ) Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Pillar Two (âPillar Twoâ) model rules, which aim to establish a global minimum tax rate of 15 percent for large multinational enterprise groups. The OECD has continued to issue new administrative guidance on the Pillar Two model rules throughout 2025. Significant uncertainty remains regarding the interpretation and consistent implementation of the Pillar Two model rules across jurisdictions, their interaction with existing national tax laws, and their alignment with current tax treaty obligations. Final adoption and implementation of Pillar Two in the jurisdictions where we operate could adversely affect our business and financial results. While it is impossible to predict whether other tax proposals will be enacted, many could have an impact on our business and financial results.
Failure to execute our strategies could result in impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets, which may negatively impact income and profitability
. 
We have goodwill of $676.9 million and other intangible assets of $105.4 million as of JulyÂ 31, 2025, which represent 45.1% of our total assets, and we have recognized impairment charges in the past. We evaluate goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if impairment indicators are present, based upon the fair value of each respective asset. The valuations prepared for the required impairment test include management's estimates of sales, profitability, cash flow generation, capital structure, cost of debt, interest rates, capital expenditures, and other assumptions. Significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, inability to achieve sales projections or cost savings, inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses, unexpected changes in the use of the assets, and divestitures may adversely impact the assumptions used in the valuations. If the estimated fair value of our goodwill or other intangible assets change in future periods, we may be required to record an impairment charge, which would reduce net income in such period.

Substantially all of our voting stock is controlled by two shareholders, while our public investors hold non-voting stock. The interests of the voting and non-voting shareholders could differ, potentially resulting in decisions that affect the value of the non-voting shares.
Substantially all of our voting stock is controlled by Elizabeth P. Bruno, one of our directors, and William H. Brady III, both of whom are descendants of the Company's founder. All of our publicly traded shares are non-voting. Therefore, the voting shareholders have control in most matters requiring approval or acquiescence by shareholders, including the composition of our Board of Directors and many corporate actions, and their interests may not align with those of the non-voting shareholders.Â Such concentration of ownership may discourage a potential acquirer from making a purchase offer that our public shareholders may find favorable and it may adversely affect the trading price for our non-voting common stock because investors may perceive disadvantages in owning stock in companies whose voting stock is controlled by a limited number of shareholders. Additionally, certain private investors, mutual funds and index sponsors have implemented rules restricting ownership, or excluding from indices, companies with non-voting publicly traded shares. For example, the Company was removed from the Russell 2000 Index in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023 for not meeting the minimum voting rights hurdle.

Cybersecurity
Brady has strategically included cybersecurity risk management into our 
integrated
 Company-wide risk management framework, which consists of administrative, operational, physical, and technical processes that we believe are appropriate to the scope and nature of our business. We believe this integrated approach allows cybersecurity considerations to form an integral part of our corporate and strategic decision-making processes. Management works closely with our information technology security team to continuously evaluate and address cybersecurity risks in alignment with our business and operational needs. Our cybersecurity policies and practices follow the cybersecurity framework of the Center for Internet Security (âCISâ) Controls.
Our cybersecurity strategy focuses on continued strengthening of our cybersecurity defense model, improvement of cybersecurity operational efficiencies, and preparedness for evolving business and technology needs including the detection, analysis, and response to known, anticipated and unexpected cybersecurity threats, management of material risks related to cybersecurity threats and resilience against cybersecurity incidents. We regularly assess potential threats and make investments to mitigate the risk of these threats against our critical information and assets by implementing a broad set of information security and cybersecurity measures, including comprehensive monitoring and enhancement of our networks and systems, intrusion prevention defense, rapid detection and response, and threat management capabilities. To supplement our internal resources, we 
engage
 external consultants to conduct independent assessments, perform penetration testing, and provide other cybersecurity-related services as needed. In addition, we engage external vendors to review and test key controls within our cybersecurity program.
Cybersecurity awareness training is provided to new employees and annually for current Brady employees, which is designed to educate employees on recognizing information security and cybersecurity concerns, how they can help protect the organization and how to inform the information technology security team of potential incidents. 
In addition, we implement processes to manage risks associated with our third-party providers, including security assessments prior to engagement and monitoring their compliance with our cybersecurity standards on an ongoing basis.
The 
Audit Committee of our Board of Directors
 is responsible for the oversight of risks from cybersecurity threats. Management updates the Audit Committee on a quarterly basis regarding our cybersecurity programs. As part of its oversight responsibilities, the Audit Committee regularly discusses and reviews with management, among other items, Bradyâs compliance and cybersecurity programs, and any significant cybersecurity matters and related strategic risk management decisions are 
escalated
 to the Board of Directors.
 
Our 
information technology security team
 reports to our Chief Information Officer (the âCIOâ) and is headed by our Information Technology Director 
(the âIT Directorâ)
. 
Our CIO is an experienced information technology professional with extensive cybersecurity and information technology risk management experience.
 
The information technology security team regularly informs our CIO, General Counsel and Chief Financial Officer with regard to cybersecurity risks and incidents, and our executive management team evaluates cybersecurity issues quarterly or as needed.
Brady has a detailed incident response plan that provides the process and workflow of communication for escalation of cybersecurity incidents to executive leadership to determine if there is a breach warranting further action. The information

technology security team, in conjunction with various departments, including finance, corporate communications, legal, regional presidents and the CIO, are charged with reviewing any incident under our materiality framework to assess whether further escalation and reporting is required and if an incident could constitute a material cybersecurity incident.
Although we 
have not experienced
 any material cybersecurity incidents to date, cybersecurity threats could materially affect the implementation of our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition, as further discussed in our risk factors in Part I, Item 1A of this report.

Market Information
Brady Corporation ClassÂ A Nonvoting Common Stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange (âNYSEâ) under the symbol BRC. There is no trading market for the Companyâs Class B Voting Common Stock.
Holders
As of AugustÂ 31, 2025, there were approximately 1,000 ClassÂ A Common Stock shareholders of record and approximately 17,000 beneficial shareholders. There are three Class B Common Stock shareholders.
Dividends
The Company has historically paid quarterly dividends on outstanding common stock. Before any dividend may be paid on the Class B Common Stock, holders of the ClassÂ A Com
mon Stock are entitled to receive an annual, noncumulative cash dividend of $0.01665 per share (subject to adjustment in the event of future stock splits, stock dividends or similar events involving shares of ClassÂ A Common Stock). Thereafter, any further dividend in that fiscal year must be paid on all shares of ClassÂ A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock on an equal basis. The Company believes that based on its historic dividend practice, this requirement will not impede it in following a similar dividend practice in the future.
During the two most recent years ended July 31 and for the first quarter of fiscal 2026, the Company declared the following dividends per share on its ClassÂ A and Class B Common Stock:

Managementâs Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Overview
Brady Corporation is a global manufacturer and supplier of identification solutions and workplace safety products that identify and protect premises, products and people. The Company is organized and managed on a geographic basis with two reportable segments: Americas & Asia and Europe & Australia.
Managementâs Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements (Item 8) in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following discussion is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of the Company for the year ended 
JulyÂ 31, 2025
 compared to the year ended JulyÂ 31, 2024.
A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023 can be found under Item 7 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended JulyÂ 31, 2024, filed with the SEC on September 6, 2024, which is available on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov and our corporate website at www.bradyid.com/corporate/investors and such information is incorporated by reference herein.
References in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to âorganic salesâ refer to sales calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, sales recorded from divested companies up to the first anniversary of their divestiture and sales recorded from acquired companies prior to the first anniversary date of their acquisition. The Companyâs organic sales disclosures exclude the effects of foreign currency translation as foreign currency translation is subject to volatility that can obscure underlying business trends. Management believes that the non-GAAP financial measure of organic sales is meaningful to investors as it provides them with useful information to aid in identifying underlying sales trends in our businesses and facilitating comparisons of our sales performance with prior periods.
Macroeconomic Conditions and Trends
The Company's operations and financial performance are subject to the risks and uncertainties inherent in the global economic environment, including inflationary pressures, supply chain disruptions, and other macroeconomic challenges. These pressures may impact the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations as the global economic outlook remains uncertain.
In recent months, the U.S. government introduced incremental import tariffs on goods imported into the U.S. from numerous countries, triggering reciprocal tariffs and other actions from many countries on goods exported from the U.S. Trade policies of the U.S. and other countries, including China, are complex and rapidly evolving. Our strategy of manufacturing products near the point of sale reduces our overall exposure to tariffs, though certain sourced inputs and manufactured items remain subject to incremental tariffs. Our business has incurred, and expects to continue to incur, additional costs as it relates to these incremental tariffs for the foreseeable future. The Company has taken and will continue to take action to mitigate inflationary pressures caused by the incremental tariffs through a combination of targeted price increases and surcharges, strategic sourcing adjustments, product portfolio optimization, as well as our ongoing efforts to drive sustainable efficiency gains in our operations and administrative structures.
Notwithstanding the uncertain situation relating to tariffs, we believe our financial strength positions us well to continue investing in acquisitions and organic growth opportunities, such as expanded sales channels, marketing programs, and research and development (âR&Dâ). We remain focused on driving sustainable efficiency gains and automation across our operations and selling, general and administrative (âSG&Aâ) functions, while also returning capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. At 
JulyÂ 31, 2025
, we had cash of
 $174.3 million, as 
well as a credit agreement with 
$
198.1
 million
 available for future borrowing, which can be increased up to 
$
1,093.1
 million
 at the Company's option and subject to certain conditions, for total available liquidity
 of $1,267.4 million.
We believe that our financial resources and liquidity levels, including the undrawn portion of our credit agreement and our ability to increase that credit line as necessary, are sufficient to support the execution of our growth strategy and to manage the impact of economic or geopolitical events that could potentially reduce sales, net income, or cash provided by operating activities. Refer to Risk Factors, included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended

Results of Operations
The comparability of the operating results for the year ended JulyÂ 31, 2025 to the year ended JulyÂ 31, 2024 has been impacted by the acquisitions of Gravotech Holding (âGravotechâ) on August 1, 2024, American Barcode and RFID Incorporated (âAB&Râ) on October 1, 2024 and the Microfluidic Solutions business unit of Funai Electric Co., Ltd. (âMicrofluidic Solutionsâ) on April 1, 2025. The operating results of Gravotech, AB&R and Microfluidic Solutions have been included since their acquisition dates. Gravotech has been included in both reportable segments, and AB&R and Microfluidic Solutions have been included in the Americas & Asia reportable segment. The comparability of the operating results for the Americas & Asia segment has also been impacted by the divestiture of two non-core businesses, one in March 2023 and another in October 2023. 
A comparison of results of operating income for the years ended JulyÂ 31, 2025, 2024, and 2023 is as follows:

Net sales increased 12.8% to $1,513.6 million in fiscal 2025 compared to $1,341.4 million in fiscal 2024, which consisted of organic sales growth of 2.6% and sales growth from acquisitions of 10.5%, which was partially offset by a decrease of 0.3% due to divestitures. Organic sales grew 4.8% in the Americas & Asia segment, while organic sales declined 1.8% in the Europe & Australia segment. 
Gross margin increased 10.6% to $760.8 million in fiscal 2025 compared to $687.9 million in fiscal 2024. As a percentage of net sales, gross margin decreased to 50.3% in fiscal 2025 from 51.3% in fiscal 2024. The decrease in gross margin as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to a non-recurring increase in cost of goods sold of $4.1 million related to the fair value adjustment to inventory from acquisitions, facility closure and other reorganization costs of $4.9 million, as well as the impact of incremental tariffs, which were partially offset by organic sales growth in higher gross margin product lines.
R&D expenses increased 17.9% to $79.9 million in fiscal 2025 compared to $67.7 million in fiscal 2024. As a percentage of net sales, R&D expenses increased to 5.3% in fiscal 2025 compared to 5.1% in fiscal 2024. The increase in R&D spending in fiscal 2025 was primarily due to the acquisition of Gravotech, and, to a lesser extent, an increase in R&D headcount within the Company's organic business. The Company remains committed to investing in new innovative product development to drive long-term organic sales growth. Investments in new printing systems, pressure sensitive materials, scanners and software are the primary focus of R&D expenditures in fiscal 2026.
SG&A expenses include selling and administrative costs directly attributed to the Americas & Asia and Europe & Australia segments, as well as certain other corporate administrative expenses including finance, information technology, human resources and other administrative expenses. SG&A expenses increased 17.9% to $444.3 million in fiscal 2025 compared to $376.7 million in fiscal 2024. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expense increased to 29.4% in fiscal 2025 compared to 28.1% in fiscal 2024 primarily due to incremental amortization expense from acquired intangible assets of $9.5 million and facility closure and other reorganization costs of $13.6 million.
Operating income decreased 2.8% to $236.6 million in fiscal 2025 compared to $243.4 million in fiscal 2024. As a percentage of sales, operating income decreased to 15.6% in fiscal 2025 compared to 18.1% in fiscal 2024. The decrease in operating income in fiscal 2025 was primarily due to facility closure and other reorganization costs, incremental amortization expense related to acquired businesses, and the fair value adjustment to inventory from acquisitions.

Investment and other income was $5.2 million in fiscal 2025 compared to $7.6 million in fiscal 2024. The decrease in investment and other income in fiscal 2025 was primarily due to a decrease in interest income resulting from a reduced cash balance and lower interest rates.
Interest expense increased to $4.7 million in fiscal 2025 compared to $3.1 million in fiscal 2024. The increase in interest expense in fiscal 2025 was primarily due to an increase in outstanding borrowings on the Company's credit agreement to fund acquisitions, which was partially offset by a decrease in the weighted average interest rate compared to fiscal 2024.
The Company's income tax rate was 20.2% in fiscal 2025 compared to 20.4% in fiscal 2024. Refer to Item 8, Note 11, âIncome Taxesâ for additional information on the Company's income tax rates.

Americas & Asia
Americas & Asia net sales increased 12.1% to $993.7 million in fiscal 2025 compared to $886.5 million in fiscal 2024, which consisted of organic sales growth of 4.8% and sales growth from acquisitions of 8.3%, which were partially offset by a decrease from foreign currency translation of 0.6% and a decrease due to a divestiture of 0.4%. Organic sales growth reflected strong execution of our commercial strategies, supported by steady industrial demand in North America, continued expansion in key end markets across Latin America, and resilient demand in Asia despite mixed economic conditions in certain countries.
Organic sales in the Americas increased in the low-single digits in fiscal 2025. The increase in organic sales was primarily due to growth in the wire identification, safety and facility identification and product identification product lines, which was partially offset by a decline in the people identification and healthcare identification product lines. 
Organic sales in Asia increased approximately 13% in fiscal 2025. The organic sales increase was primarily driven by higher demand from electronics manufacturing services providers, technology companies, and industrial suppliers across Japan, India, Malaysia and Singapore. This growth was partially offset by lower volumes in China.
Segment profit increased 6.6% to $209.8 million in fiscal 2025 from $196.8 million in fiscal 2024. As a percent of net sales, segment profit decreased to 21.1% in fiscal 2025 from 22.2% in fiscal 2024. The increase in segment profit was primarily due to increased profit from organic sales growth, which was partially offset by facility closure and other reorganization costs and incremental amortization expense related to acquired businesses. The decrease in segment profit as a percentage of sales was primarily due to costs associated with the closure of two facilities, incremental amortization from acquired businesses and purchase accounting adjustments, which was partially offset by increased profit from organic sales growth.

Europe & Australia
Europe & Australia sales increased 14.3% to $519.9 million in fiscal 2025 compared to $454.9 million in fiscal 2024. The increase consisted of sales growth from acquisitions of 14.7% and an increase from foreign currency translation of 1.4%, which was partially offset by an organic sales decline of 1.8%. Organic sales declined due to softer industrial demand, driven by lower manufacturing output and ongoing economic uncertainty in Europe, particularly the United Kingdom and Germany, and by a weaker growth outlook in Australia. Looking ahead, the Company remains focused on leveraging its capabilities and market presence to drive growth in key markets over the long term.
Organic sales in Europe declined in the low-single digits in fiscal 2025. The decline was driven by the safety and facility identification and people identification product lines, which was partially offset by growth in the wire identification product line. The decline was driven by the United Kingdom and Western Europe Regions, which was partially offset by growth in the Middle East and Nordic Regions.
Organic sales in Australia declined in the mid-single digits in fiscal 2025. The organic sales decline was primarily driven by a decrease in volume in the safety and facility and wire identification product lines.
Segment profit decreased 19.4% to $56.9 million in fiscal 2025 compared to $70.6 million in fiscal 2024. As a percentage of net sales, segment profit decreased to 11.0% in fiscal 2025 compared to 15.5% in fiscal 2024. The decrease in segment profit and segment profit as a percentage of sales was primarily due to incremental amortization from acquired businesses, purchase accounting adjustments and reorganization costs in order to streamline our operating structure. 
Financial Condition
Liquidity & Capital Resources
The Company's cash balances are generated and held in numerous locations throughout the world. At JulyÂ 31, 2025, approximately 97% of the Company's cash and cash equivalents were held outside the United States. The Company's organic and inorganic growth has historically been funded by a combination of cash provided by operating activities and debt financing. The Company believes that its cash flow from operating activities and its borrowing capacity are sufficient to fund its anticipated requirements for working capital, capital expenditures, research and development, common stock repurchases, dividend payments, and strategic acquisitions for the next 12 months and beyond. Although the Company believes these sources of cash are currently sufficient to fund domestic operations, annual cash needs could require repatriation of cash to the U.S. from foreign jurisdictions, which may result in additional tax payments.
Cash Flows
Cash and cash equivalents were $174.3 million at JulyÂ 31, 2025, a decrease of $75.8 million from JulyÂ 31, 2024. The following summarizes the cash flow statement for the years ended July 31:

Net cash provided by operating activities was $181.2 million during fiscal 2025 compared to $255.1 million in fiscal 2024. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to changes in working capital, including inventory growth to maintain high service levels and align with customer needs, higher receivables from strong organic growth in the Americas & Asia segment, and lower payroll-related accruals and accounts payable due to the timing of payments.
Net cash used in investing activities was $171.3 million during fiscal 2025, which primarily consisted of the acquisition of businesses of $144.5 million and capital expenditures of $27.6 million. Net cash used in investing activities was $81.0 million in fiscal 2024, which primarily consisted of capital expenditures, which included the purchase of a previously leased facility in Mexico and facility construction costs in Belgium.
Net cash used in financing activities was $83.9 million during fiscal 2025 compared to $70.5 million in fiscal 2024. The 
20
Table
 of Contents
increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to increased net repayments on borrowings on our credit agreement following the funding of acquisitions in fiscal 2025, which was partially offset by a decline in share repurchases compared to the prior year.
Material Cash Requirements
Our material cash requirements for known contractual obligations include capital expenditures, borrowings on our credit agreement and lease obligations. We believe that net cash provided by operating activities will continue to be adequate to meet our liquidity and capital needs for these items over the next 12 months and in the long-term beyond the next 12 months. We also have cash requirements for purchase orders and contracts for the purchase of inventory and other goods and services, which are based on current and anticipated customer needs and are fulfilled by our suppliers within short time horizons. We do not have significant agreements for the purchase of inventory or other goods or services specifying minimum order quantities. In addition, we may have liabilities for uncertain tax positions, but we do not believe that the cash requirements to meet any of these liabilities will be material. A discussion of income taxes is contained in Note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
Credit Agreement and Covenant Compliance
Refer to Item 8, Note 6, âDebtâ for information regarding the Company's credit agreement and covenant compliance.
Inflation and Changing Prices
Essentially all of the Companyâs revenue is derived from the sale of its products and services in competitive markets. Because prices are influenced by market conditions, it is not always possible to fully recover cost increases through pricing. Changes in product mix from year to year, timing differences in instituting price changes, and the large amount of custom products make it impracticable to accurately define the impact of inflation on profit margins.
Critical Accounting Estimates
Managementâs discussion and analysis of the Companyâs financial condition and results of operations are based upon the companyâs consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The Company bases these estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates and judgments.
The Company believes the following accounting estimates are most critical to an understanding of its financial statements. Estimates are considered to be critical if they meet both of the following criteria: (1)Â the estimate requires assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made, and (2)Â material changes in the estimates are reasonably likely from period to period. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting estimates, refer to Note 1 to the companyâs consolidated financial statements.
Income Taxes
The Company operates in numerous taxing jurisdictions and is subject to regular examinations by U.S. federal, state and non-U.S. taxing authorities. Its income tax positions are based on research and interpretations of the income tax laws and rulings in each of the jurisdictions in which the Company does business. Due to the ambiguity of laws and rulings in each jurisdiction, the differences and interplay in tax laws between those jurisdictions, the uncertainty of how underlying facts may be construed and the inherent uncertainty in estimating the final resolution of complex tax audit matters, the Company's estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments.
While the Company has support for the positions it takes on tax returns, taxing authorities may assert different interpretations of laws and facts and may challenge cross-jurisdictional transactions. The Company generally re-evaluates the technical merits of its tax positions and recognizes an uncertain tax benefit when (i)Â there is completion of a tax audit; (ii)Â there is a change in applicable tax laws including a tax case ruling or legislative guidance; or (iii)Â there is an expiration of the statute of limitations. The liability for unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, was $21.8 million and $22.6 million as of JulyÂ 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. If recognized, $18.3 million of unrecognized tax benefits would reduce the Company's income tax rate as of both JulyÂ 31, 2025 and 2024. Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits were $6.6 million and $6.1 million as of JulyÂ 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense on the consolidated statements of income. The Company believes it is reasonably possible that the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits could be reduced by up to $3.1 million in 
21
Table
 of Contents
the next 12Â months as a result of the resolution of worldwide tax matters, tax audit settlements, amended tax filings, and/or statute expirations, which would be the maximum amount that would be recognized as an income tax benefit in the consolidated statements of income.
The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future, based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. The Company establishes valuation allowances for its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. This requires management to make judgments regarding: (i) the timing and amount of the reversal of taxable temporary differences, (ii) expected future taxable income or loss, and (iii) the impact of tax planning strategies. The Company recognized valuation allowances for its deferred tax assets
 of 
$82.2 million
 
and $47.2 million as of JulyÂ 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively, which were primarily related to foreign tax credit carryforwards and net operating loss carryforwards in its various tax jurisdictions.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
The allocation of purchase price for business combinations requires management estimates and judgment as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business and the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets in determining the estimated fair value. If the actual results differ from these estimates, it could result in an impairment of intangible assets and goodwill or require acceleration of the amortization expense of finite-lived intangible assets. In addition, goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets must be tested for impairment at least annually. If circumstances or events prior to the date of the required annual assessment indicate that, in management's judgment, it is more likely than not that there has been a reduction of fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value, the Company performs an impairment analysis at the time of such circumstance or event. Changes in management's estimates or judgments could result in an impairment charge, and such a charge could have an adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.
The Company has identified six reporting units within its two reportable segments, Americas & Asia and Europe & Australia, with the following goodwill balances as of JulyÂ 31, 2025: North America, $494.8 million; Europe, $179.3 million; and Latin America, $2.9 million. The other three identified reporting units each have a goodwill balance of zero. The Company has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its respective carrying value. If the qualitative assessment leads to a determination that the fair value of a reporting unit may be less than its carrying value, or if the Company elects to bypass the qualitative assessment altogether, the Company performs a quantitative impairment test by calculating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing the fair value with its associated carrying value. When the Company performs the quantitative test for goodwill, the Company establishes the fair value for the reporting unit based on the income approach, in which a discounted cash flow model is utilized, the market approach, in which market multiples of comparable companies are utilized, or a combination of both approaches. The income approach requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including forecasted sales growth, operating income projections, and discount rates and changes in these assumptions may adversely impact the fair value assessments. The market approach requires significant assumptions related to the selection of comparable publicly traded companies and the market multiples. Significant negative industry or macroeconomic trends, disruptions to the Company's business, loss of significant customers, inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses, unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets or in entity structure, and divestitures may adversely impact the assumptions used in the valuations.
The Company completes its annual goodwill impairment analysis on May 1 of each fiscal year and evaluates its reporting units for potential triggering events on a quarterly basis in accordance with ASC 350, âIntangibles - Goodwill and Other.â In addition to the metrics listed above, the Company considers multiple internal and external factors when evaluating its reporting units for potential impairment, including (i) GDP growth for the respective geography, (ii) industry and market factors such as competition and changes in the market for the reporting unit's products, (iii) new product development, (iv) competing technologies, (v) overall financial performance such as cash flows, actual and planned revenue and profitability, and (vi) changes in the strategy of the reporting unit. In the event the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value, the Company would recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value. If necessary, the Company may consult valuation specialists to assist with the assessment of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit.
On May 1, 2025, the Company performed the qualitative assessment for all three reporting units with goodwill balances and determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value exceeds the carrying value for each reporting unit, and as such, goodwill was not considered impaired.

Business Combinations
The Company uses the acquisition method of accounting to allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. If the fair value of net assets acquired exceeds the purchase price, the Company records the excess as a bargain purchase gain in earnings after reassessing the estimated values. Assigning fair market values to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of an acquisition requires knowledge of current market values and the values of assets in use and often requires the application of judgment regarding estimates and assumptions. While the ultimate responsibility resides with management, for material acquisitions, we retain the services of certified valuation specialists to assist with assigning estimated values to certain acquired assets, including intangible assets and significant tangible long-lived assets. The valuation methods used to determine the estimated fair value of intangible assets included the multi-period excess earnings method for customer relationships using customer inputs and contributory charges, and the relief from royalty method for tradenames and technological know-how. Several assumptions and estimates were involved in the application of these valuation methods, including forecasted sales growth, margin, and cash flows attributable to existing customers, obsolescence factor, royalty rate, contributory asset charges, customer attrition rate, tax rates, and discount rates. Tangible long-lived assets are valued using a combination of the income, cost and market value approaches. While we believe expectations and assumptions utilized for historical business combinations have been reasonable, they are inherently uncertain and include significant management judgment.

ItemÂ 7A.
 
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
The Companyâs business operations give rise to market risk exposure due to changes in foreign exchange rates. To manage that risk effectively, the Company enters into hedging transactions according to established guidelines and policies that enable it to mitigate the adverse effects of t
his financial market risk.
The global nature of the Companyâs business requires active participation in the foreign exchange markets. The Company has manufacturing facilities and sells and distributes its products throughout the world and therefore has assets, liabilities and cash flows in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, the Companyâs financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak macroeconomic conditions in the foreign markets in which the Company manufactures, distributes and sells its products. The Companyâs operating results are principally exposed to changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the Euro, the British Pound, the Mexican Peso, the Canadian dollar, the Australian dollar, the Singapore dollar, the Malaysian Ringgit, and the Chinese Yuan. 
The objective of the Companyâs foreign currency exchange risk management is to 
minimize the impact of currency movements on non-functional currency transactions. To achieve this objective, the Company hedges a portion of known exposures using forward contracts. As of JulyÂ 31, 2025, the notional amount of outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges was $53.5 million. The Company uses Euro-denominated debt of $50.2 million and British Pound-denominated debt of $10.6 million designated as hedge instruments to hedge portions of the Companyâs net investment in its Euro-denominated and British Pound-denominated businesses. The Company's multi-currency revolving credit agreement allows it to borrow up to $200 million in currencies other than U.S. dollars. Debt issued in currencies other than U.S. dollars acts as a natural hedge to the Company's exposure to the associated currency.
The Company also faces exchange rate risk from transactions with customers in countries outside the United States and from intercompany transactions between affiliates. Although the Company has a U.S. dollar functional currency for reporting purposes, it has manufacturing sites throughout the world and a significant portion of its sales are generated in foreign currencies. Costs incurred and sales recorded by subsidiaries operating outside of the United States are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect during the respective period. As a result, the Company is exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the U.S. dollar. In particular, the Company has more sales in European currencies than it has expenses in those currencies. Therefore, when European currencies strengthen or weaken against the U.S. dollar, operating profits are increased or decreased, respectively. In fiscal 2025, the fluctuation in currency exchange rates had a negligible effect on sales; however, the effect was more pronounced in interim periods compared to fiscal 2024 as the U.S. dollar depreciated, on average, against other major currencies throughout the year.
Changes in foreign currency exchange rates for the Companyâs foreign subsidiaries reporting in local currencies are generally reported as a component of stockholdersâ equity. The Companyâs currency translation adjustments recorded during the years ended July 31, 2025, 2024, and 2023, as a separate component of stockholdersâ equity, were favorable by $18.2 million, unfavorable by $14.5 million, and favorable by $16.0 million, respectively. As of JulyÂ 31, 2025 and 2024, the Companyâs foreign subsidiaries had net current assets (defined as current assets less current liabilities) subject to foreign currency translation risk of $259.2Â million and $324.5Â million, respectively. The potential decrease in net current assets as of JulyÂ 31, 2025, from a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately $25.9Â million. This sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel shift in all major foreign currency exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar. Exchange rates rarely move in the same direction relative to the U.S. dollar due to positive and negative correlations of the various global currencies. This assumption may overstate the impact of changing exchange rates on individual assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency.
The Company could be exposed to interest rate risk through its corporate borrowing activities. The objective of the Companyâs interest rate risk management activities is to manage the levels of the Companyâs fixed and floating interest rate exposure to be consistent with the Companyâs preferred mix. The interest rate risk management program allows the Company to enter into approved interest rate derivatives if there is a desire to modify the Companyâs exposure to interest rates. As of JulyÂ 31, 2025, the Company had no interest rate derivatives and no fixed rate debt outstanding.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Brady Corporation
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Brady Corporation and subsidiaries (the âCompanyâ) as of July 31, 2025 and 2024, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended July 31, 2025, and the related notes and the schedule listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the âfinancial statementsâ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of July 31, 2025 and 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended July 31, 2025, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2025, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control â Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated September 4, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Taxes â Valuation Allowances â Refer to Notes 1 and 11 to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
The Company recognizes deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized in the future. Future realization of deferred tax assets depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income within the carryback or carryforward period of the appropriate character under the relevant tax law. Sources of taxable income include future reversals of deferred tax assets and liabilities, future taxable income (exclusive of the reversals of deferred tax assets and liabilities), taxable income in prior carryback year(s) if permitted under the tax law, and tax planning strategies. The Companyâs valuation allowance for deferred tax assets was $82.2 million as of July 31, 2025.
The Companyâs determination of the valuation allowance involves estimates. Managementâs primary estimate in determining whether a valuation allowance should be established is the projection of future sources of taxable income. Auditing

 of Contents
managementâs estimate of future sources of taxable income, which affects the recorded valuation allowances, required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our income tax specialists.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to estimated future sources of taxable income included the following, among others: 
â¢
We tested the effectiveness of managementâs controls over the estimates of future sources of taxable income.
â¢
With the assistance of our income tax specialists, we considered relevant tax laws and regulations in evaluating (1) the appropriateness of managementâs estimates of future sources of taxable income, including whether the future sources were of the appropriate character, and (2) the appropriateness of the carryforward periods utilized by management.
â¢
We evaluated managementâs ability to accurately estimate future sources of taxable income by comparing actual results to managementâs historical estimates. Further, we evaluated the reasonableness of managementâs estimates of future sources of taxable income by comparing the estimates to historical sources of taxable income or losses and evaluating whether there have been any changes that would affect management's estimates of future sources of taxable income.
â¢
We evaluated managementâs assessment that it is more likely than not that sufficient taxable income will be generated in the future to utilize the net deferred tax assets.

BRADY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Years Ended JulyÂ 31, 2025, 2024 and 2023 
(In thousands, except share and per share amounts)
1. 
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Nature of Operations â
 Brady Corporation is a global manufacturer and supplier of identification solutions and workplace safety products that identify and protect premises, products and people. The ability to provide customers with a broad range of proprietary, customized, and diverse products for use in various applications, along with a commitment to quality and service, a global footprint, and multiple sales channels, have made Brady a world leader in many of its markets.
Principles of Consolidation â
 The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Brady Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions between consolidated subsidiaries have been eliminated in consolidation.
 
Use of Estimates â
 The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (âU.S. GAAPâ), which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Acquisitions
 â The Company recognizes assets acquired, liabilities assumed, contractual contingencies and contingent consideration at their fair value on the acquisition date. The operating results of the acquired companies are included in the Companyâs consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the measurement period are recorded in income tax expense.
Cash Equivalents â
 The Company considers all highly-liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
Concentration of Credit Risk
 â The Company places temporary cash investments with global financial institutions of high credit quality. The Company performs periodic evaluations of the relative credit standing of its financial institutions and limits the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution. In addition, the Company has a broad customer base representing many diverse industries throughout the globe. Consequently, no significant concentration of credit risk is considered to exist.
Accounts Receivable â
 The Company's policy for estimating the allowance for credit losses on accounts receivables considers several factors including historical loss experience, the age of delinquent receivable balances due, and economic conditions. Specific customer reserves are made during review of significant outstanding balances due, in which customer creditworthiness and current economic trends may indicate that it is probable the receivable will not be recovered. Accounts receivable are written off after collection efforts occur and the receivable is deemed uncollectible. Adjustments to the allowance for credit losses are recorded in selling, general and administrative (âSG&Aâ) expense.
 
Inventories â
 Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value and include material, labor, and overhead. Cost has been determined using the last-in, first-out (âLIFOâ) method for certain inventories in the U.S. (
12.8
% of total inventories at JulyÂ 31, 2025, and 
13.0
% of total inventories at JulyÂ 31, 2024) and the first-in, first-out (âFIFOâ) or average cost methods for all other inventories. Had all inventories been accounted for on a FIFO basis instead of on a LIFO basis, the carrying value of inventories would have increased by $

Goodwill â
 The Company tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis on the first day of the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it may be impaired. Under U.S. GAAP, the Company has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of one of its reporting units is greater than its carrying value (âStep 0â). If the qualitative assessment leads to a determination that the reporting unitâs fair value is less than its carrying value, or if the Company elects to bypass the qualitative assessment altogether, it is required to perform a quantitative impairment test (âStep 1â) by calculating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing the fair value with its associated carrying value. During the fiscal year 2025 annual impairment test, the Company first assessed goodwill recoverability qualitatively using the Step 0 approach for each reporting unit. For the qualitative assessment, the Company considered the most recent quantitative analysis, which was performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023 for all three reporting units, including assumptions used, such as discount rates, indicated fair values, and the amounts by which those fair values exceeded their carrying amounts. Further, the Company compared actual performance in fiscal year 2025 to the internal financial projections used in the prior quantitative analyses. Additionally, the Company considered various other factors including macroeconomic conditions, relevant industry and market trends, and factors specific to the Company that could indicate a potential change in the fair value of the reporting units. Lastly, the Company evaluated whether any events have occurred or any circumstances have changed since that time that would indicate that goodwill may have become impaired since the last quantitative tests. Based on these qualitative assessments, the Company determined it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeds its respective carrying value, and goodwill was not considered impaired as of May 1, 2025. As such, the Step 1 quantitative goodwill impairment analysis was not necessary. No goodwill impairment charges were recognized during the year ended JulyÂ 31, 2025.
Other Intangible and Long-Lived Assets â 
Intangible assets with definite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives to reflect the pattern of economic benefits consumed. Intangible assets with indefinite lives as well as goodwill are not subject to amortization. These assets are assessed for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances have occurred that indicate the asset may not be recoverable or that the remaining estimated useful life may warrant revision. In addition, the Company performs qualitative assessments on a quarterly basis of significant events and circumstances, such as historical and current results, assumptions regarding future performance, and strategic initiatives and overall economic factors.
The Company evaluates indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset to the carrying value. Fair value is estimated using the income approach based upon current sales projections applying the relief from royalty method. If the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The Company evaluates long-lived assets, including finite-lived intangible assets, operating lease assets, and property, plant, and equipment, for recoverability by comparing an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows, derived from internal forecasts, over the remaining life of the primary asset to the carrying amount of the asset group. To the extent the undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the asset are less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. 
In fiscal 
2025
, long-lived and other intangible assets were analyzed for potential impairment. As a result of the analysis, no impairment charges were recorded.
 
Leases
 â The Company accounts for leases in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (âASCâ) 842 âLeases.â The Company determines whether an arrangement contains a lease at contract inception based on whether the arrangement provides the Company with the right to direct the use of and the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from 
34
Table
 of Contents
an identified asset in exchange for consideration. The Company recognizes a right-of-use (âROUâ ) asset and lease liability for its lease commitments with initial terms greater than one year.
The initial measurement of ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of future lease payments over the expected lease term. The ROU asset also includes any lease payments made on or before the commencement date, initial direct costs incurred, and is reduced by any lease incentives received. Some of the Companyâs leases include options to extend the lease agreement, of which the exercise is at the Companyâs sole discretion. The majority of renewal options are not included in the calculation of ROU assets and liabilities as they are not reasonably certain to be exercised. Some of the Company's lease agreements include rental payments that are adjusted periodically for inflation or the change in an index or rate. These variable lease payments are generally excluded from the initial measurement of the ROU asset and lease liability and are recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred. The Company has lease agreements that include both lease and non-lease components, which the Company elected to account for as a single lease component.
The Company determines the present value of future lease payments using its incremental borrowing rate, as the discount rate implicit within the Companyâs leases generally cannot be readily determined. The incremental borrowing rate is estimated based on the sovereign credit rating for the countries in which the Company has its largest operations, adjusted for several factors, such as internal credit spread, lease terms, and other market information available at the lease commencement date.
As of JulyÂ 31, 2025, all leases are accounted for as operating leases, with lease expense being recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Operating leases are reflected in âOperating lease assets,â âCurrent operating lease liabilities,â and âLong-term operating lease liabilitiesâ in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Operating lease expense is recognized in either cost of goods sold or selling, general, and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income, based on the nature of the lease. ROU assets are evaluated for impairment in the same manner as long-lived assets. No impairment charges were recognized related to operating lease assets during the year ended JulyÂ 31, 2025
.
Revenue Recognition â
 The Company recognizes revenue when a sales arrangement with a customer exists, the transaction price is fixed or determinable and the Company has satisfied its performance obligations per the sales arrangement. The majority of the Companyâs revenue relates to the sale of identification and safety products and revenue is recognized at the point in which the customer obtains control of the products. The Company considers control to have transferred when legal title, physical possession, and the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the asset have transferred to the customer and the collection of the transaction price is reasonably assured, most of which occur upon the shipment or delivery of goods to customers. Revenue is measured at the determinable transaction price, net of estimated sales returns, including product returns and credit memos, and sales rebates. The Company estimates product returns and credit memos based on historical return rates. As of JulyÂ 31, 2025 and 2024, the allowance for product returns and credit memos was $
5,434
 and $
4,210
, respectively.
 
Shipping and Handling Costs â
 Shipping and handling fees billed to a customer in a sale transaction are reported as net sales and the related costs incurred for shipping and handling are reported in cost of goods sold.
Advertising Costs â
 Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense for the years ended JulyÂ 31, 2025, 2024, and 2023 was $
50,349
, $
50,296
, and $
53,591
, respectively.
Stock-Based Compensation â
 The Company measures and recognizes the compensation expense for all share-based awards made to employees and directors based on estimated grant-date fair values. The Black-Scholes option valuation model is used to determine the fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant. The Company recognizes the compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, of all share-based awards on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the award. If it is determined that it is unlikely the award will vest, the expense recognized to date for the award is generally reversed in the period in which this is evident and the remaining expense is not recorded.
The Black-Scholes model requires the use of assumptions which determine the fair value of stock-based awards. The Company uses historical data regarding stock option exercise behaviors to estimate the expected term of options granted based on the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. Expected volatilities are based on the historical volatility of the Companyâs stock. The expected dividend yield is based on the Companyâs historical dividend payments and historical yield. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect on the grant date for the length of time corresponding to the expected term of the option. The market value is calculated as the average of the high and the low stock price on the date of the grant. Refer to No

Other Comprehensive Income
 
â
 Other comprehensive income consists of net unrealized gains and losses from cash flow hedges, the unamortized gain on defined-benefit pension plans net of their related tax effects, and foreign currency translation adjustments, which includes the impact of foreign currency translations, the settlements of net investment hedges, and long-term intercompany loan translation adjustments.
 
Foreign Currency Translation â
 The assets and liabilities of subsidiaries whose functional currency is a currency other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at end of period rates of exchange, and income and expense accounts are translated at the average rates of exchange for the period. Resulting foreign currency translation adjustments are included in other comprehensive income.
Income Taxes â
 The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740 âIncome Taxes.â Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to be realized or settled. Valuation allowances are established when it is estimated that it is more likely than not that the tax benefit of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The Company recognizes the benefit of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the tax authority. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which a change in judgment occurs.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments â
 The Company believes that the carrying amount of its financial instruments (cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and other current liabilities) approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments. Refer to Note 6, âDebtâ for more information regarding the fair value of long-term debt and Note 13, âFair Value Measurementsâ for information regarding fair value measurements.
Foreign Currency Hedging â
 The objective of the Companyâs foreign currency exchange risk management is to minimize the impact of currency movements on non-functional currency transactions and minimize the foreign currency translation impact on the Companyâs foreign operations. While the Companyâs risk management objectives and strategies are driven from an economic perspective, the Company attempts, where possible and practical, to ensure that the hedging strategies it engages in qualify for hedge accounting and result in accounting treatment where the earnings effect of the hedging instrument provides substantial offset (in the same period) to the income effect of the hedged item. 
The Company recognizes derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at fair value. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value of the derivatives designated as hedges are recorded as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (âAOCIâ) in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income and are reclassified into the same income statement line item in the period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects income. Refer to Note 14, âDerivatives and Hedging Activitiesâ for more information regarding the Companyâs derivative instruments and hedging activities.
New Accounting Standards 
Adopted Standards
In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (âFASBâ) issued Accounting Standards Update (âASUâ) 2023-07, âSegment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures.â The guidance requires expanded interim and annual disclosures of segment information including the disclosure of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker and included within segment profit and loss. The Company adopted ASU 2023-07 for the year ended July 31, 2025, with retrospective application of the expanded segment information for the years ended July 31, 2024 and 2023. Additional information regarding the Company's reportable segments is included in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements.
Standards not yet adopted
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, âIncome Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures.â The guidance requires expanded annual disclosures including the standardization and disaggregation of income tax rate reconciliation categories and the amount of income taxes paid by jurisdiction. The guidance is effective for the Companyâs fiscal year 2026 Form 10-K. The adoption of this guidance is not anticipated to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.

Table
 of Contents
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, âIncome Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses.â The guidance requires expanded interim and annual disclosures of expense information including the amounts of inventory purchases, employee compensation, depreciation, amortization, and depletion within commonly presented expense captions during the period. The guidance is effective for the Company's fiscal 2028 Form 10-K and interim periods thereafter. The Company is currently evaluating the ASU to determine its impact on the Company's disclosures.

Deferred Compensation Plans
The Company has two deferred compensation plans, the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan and the Director Deferred Compensation Plan that allow for compensation to be deferred into either the Company's Class A Nonvoting Common Stock or into other investment funds. Neither plan allows funds to be transferred between the Company's Class A Nonvoting Common Stock and the other investment funds. 
At JulyÂ 31, 2025, the deferred compensation balance in stockholdersâ equity represents the investment at the original cost of shares held in the Companyâs ClassÂ A Nonvoting Common Stock for the deferred compensation plans. The balance of shares held in the Rabbi Trust represents the investment in the Companyâs ClassÂ A Nonvoting Common Stock at the original cost of all the Companyâs ClassÂ A Nonvoting Common Stock held in deferred compensation plans.

For the PRSUs granted during the years ended JulyÂ 31, 2025 and 2024, awards will vest based on achievement of performance conditions relating to Company revenue and diluted EPS targets. For the PRSUs granted during the year ended JulyÂ 31, 2023, the vesting criteria for 50% of the grant is based upon the Company's total shareholder return (âTSRâ) relative to the S&P 600 SmallCap Industrials Index over a three-year performance period, and the vesting criteria for the remaining 50% of the grant is based upon Company revenue targets.
The PRSUs granted during the year ended July 31, 2025 had a fair value determined by the average of the high and low stock price on the date of grant.

The decrease
 
in accumulated other comprehensive loss as of JulyÂ 31, 2025 compared to JulyÂ 31, 2024 was primarily due to the depreciation of the U.S. dollar against certain other currencies during the fiscal year. Of the amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss during the years ended JulyÂ 31, 2025 and 2024, unrealized gains or losses on cash flow hedges were reclassified into âCost of goods soldâ and net unamortized gains on post-retirement plans were reclassified into âInvestment and other incomeâ on the consolidated statements of income.

Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue when control of the product or service transfers to the customer at an amount that represents the consideration expected to be received in exchange for those products and services.
Nature of Products 
The Companyâs revenues are primarily from the sale of identification solutions and workplace safety products that are shipped and billed to customers. All revenue is from contracts with customers and is included in âNet salesâ on the consolidated statements of income. 
44
Table
 of Contents
Performance Obligations
The Companyâs contracts with customers consist of purchase orders, which in some cases are governed by master supply or distributor agreements. For each contract, the Company considers the commitment to transfer tangible products, which are generally capable of being distinct, to be separate performance obligations.
The majority of the Company's revenue is earned and recognized at a point in time through ship-and-bill performance obligations where the customer typically obtains control of the product upon shipment or delivery, depending on freight terms. The Company considers control to have transferred if legal title, physical possession, and the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the asset have transferred to the customer and the Company has a present right to payment. In almost all cases, control transfers once a product is shipped or delivered, as this is when the customer is able to direct and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits associated with use of the asset.
Transaction Price and Variable Consideration
Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for the transfer of product to a customer. The transaction price is generally the price stated in the contract specific for each item sold, adjusted for all applicable variable considerations. Variable consideration generally includes discounts, returns, credits, rebates, or other allowances that reduce the transaction price. Certain discounts and price assurances are fixed and known at the time of sale. 
The Company estimates the amount of variable consideration and reduces the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. The expected value method is used to estimate expected returns and allowances based on historical experience. The most likely amount method is used to estimate customer rebates, which are offered retrospectively and typically defined in the master supply or distributor agreement.
Payment Terms
While the Companyâs standard payment terms are net 30 days, the specific payment terms and conditions in its contracts with customers vary by type and location of the customer. Cash discounts may be offered to certain customers. The Company has payment terms in its contracts with customers of less than one year, and therefore, does not recognize the time value of money or any financing component of such contracts.
Warranties
The Company offers standard warranty coverage on substantially all products which provides the customer with assurance that the product will function as intended. This standard warranty coverage is accounted for as an assurance warranty and is not considered to be a separate performance obligation. The Company records a liability for product warranty obligations at the time of sale based on historical warranty experience that is included in cost of goods sold.
The Company also offers extended warranty coverage for certain products, which it accounts for as service warranties. In most cases, the extended service warranty is included in the sales price of the product and is not sold separately. The Company considers the extended service warranty to be a separate performance obligation and allocates a portion of the transaction price to the service warranty based on the estimated stand-alone selling price. At the time of sale, the extended warranty transaction price is recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the life of the service warranty period. The deferred revenue is considered a contract liability as the Company has a right to payment at the time the product with the related extended service warranty is shipped or delivered and therefore, payment is received in advance of the Company's performance. 
Contract Balances
The balance of contract liabilities associated with service warranty performance obligations was $
3,060
 and $
2,947
 as of JulyÂ 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. This also represents the amount of unsatisfied performance obligations related to contracts that extend beyond one year. The current portion and non-current portion of contract liabilities are included in âOther current liabilitiesâ and âOther liabilities,â respectively, on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. During the year ended JulyÂ 31, 2025, the Company recognized revenue of $
1,373
 that was included in the contract liability balance at the beginning of the period from the amortization of extended service warranties. Of the contract liability balance outstanding at JulyÂ 31, 2025, the Company expects to recognize 
42
% by the end of fiscal 2026, an additional 
28
% by the end of fiscal 2027, and the balance thereafter.Â

Segment Information
The Company is organized and managed within 
two
 regions: Americas & Asia and Europe & Australia, which are the reportable segments. The Company's Chief Executive Officer (âCEOâ), who is also the Company's Chief Operating Decision Maker (âCODMâ), uses segment profit in measuring segment performance, allocating resources, evaluating performance in periodic reviews, and during the development of the annual budget and the regular forecasting process. The CODM considers budget-to-actual variances on a quarterly basis, as well as segment-specific forecasting, when making decisions about the allocation of operating and capital resources to each segment. The CODM also uses the segment's net sales in measuring segment performance.

Uncertain Tax Positions
The Company follows the guidance in ASC 740, âIncome Taxesâ regarding uncertain tax positions. The guidance requires application of a more-likely-than-not threshold to the recognition and de-recognition of income tax positions.

Table
 of Contents
Of the $
21,802
 of unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, $
18,318
 would affect the Company's income tax rate. The Company has classified $
18,502
 and $
19,527
, excluding interest and penalties, of the reserve for uncertain tax positions in âOther liabilitiesâ on the consolidated balance sheets as of 
JulyÂ 31, 2025
 and 2024, respectively. The Company has classified $
3,300
 and $
3,063
, excluding interest and penalties, as a reduction of long-term deferred income tax assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of 
JulyÂ 31, 2025
 and 2024, respectively.
Interest expense is recognized on the amount of potentially underpaid taxes associated with the Company's tax positions, beginning in the first period in which interest starts accruing under the respective tax law and continuing until the tax positions are settled. The Company recognized interest expense of $
299
, $
893
, and $
700
 on the reserve for uncertain tax positions during the years ended 
JulyÂ 31, 2025
, 2024, and 2023, respectively. The Company also recognized benefits related to penalties of $
120
, $
38
, and $
281
 during the years ended 
JulyÂ 31, 2025
, 2024, and 2023, respectively. These amounts are net of reversals due to reductions for tax positions of prior years, statute of limitations, and settlements. At 
JulyÂ 31, 2025
 and 2024, the Company had $
4,740
 and $
4,448
, respectively, accrued for interest on unrecognized tax benefits. Penalties are accrued if the tax position does not meet the minimum statutory threshold to avoid the payment of a penalty. At 
JulyÂ 31, 2025
 and 2024, the Company had $
1,893
 and $
1,631
, respectively, accrued for penalties on unrecognized tax benefits. Interest expense and penalties are recorded as a component of âIncome tax expenseâ in the consolidated statements of income.
The Company estimates that it is reasonably possible that the unrecognized tax benefits may be reduced by up to $
3,117
 in the next 12 months as a result of the resolution of worldwide tax matters, tax audit settlements, amended tax filings, and/or the expiration of statute of limitations, all of which, if recognized, would result in an income tax benefit in the consolidated statements of income.
During the year ended 
JulyÂ 31, 2025
, the Company recognized $
6,033
 of tax benefits (including interest and penalties) associated with the lapse of statutes of limitations.
The Company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S., various states, and foreign jurisdictions.

Fair Value Measurements
In accordance with fair value accounting guidance, the Company determines fair value based on the exchange price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. The inputs used to measure fair value are classified into the following hierarchy:
Level 1
 â Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical instruments that are accessible as of the reporting date.
Level 2 
â Other significant pricing inputs that are either directly or indirectly observable.
Level 3
 â Significant unobservable pricing inputs, which result in the use of management's own assumptions.
The following table summarizes the Company's financial assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis at 
JulyÂ 31, 2025
 and JulyÂ 31, 2024, according to the valuation techniques the Company used to determine their fair values.

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instrument:
Deferred compensation plan assets
: The Companyâs deferred compensation investments consist of investments in mutual funds, which are included in âOther assetsâ on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. These investments were classified as Level 1 as the shares of these investments trade with sufficient frequency and volume to enable us to obtain pricing information on an ongoing basis.
Foreign exchange contracts
: The Companyâs foreign exchange contracts were classified as Level 2 as the fair value was based on the present value of the future cash flows using external models that use observable inputs, such as interest rates, yield curves and foreign exchange rates. See
 Note 
14, âDerivatives and Hedging Activities,â for additional information.
There have been no transfers of assets or liabilities between the fair value hierarchy levels, outlined above, during the years ended 
JulyÂ 31, 2025
 and JulyÂ 31, 2024. 
See Note

 for information regarding the fair value of the Company's long-term debt.
 14. 
Derivatives and Hedging Activities
The Company utilizes forward foreign exchange currency contracts to reduce the exchange rate risk of specific foreign currency denominated transactions. These contracts typically require the exchange of a foreign currency for U.S. dollars at a fixed rate at a future date, with maturities of less than 
18
 months, which qualify as cash flow hedges or net investment hedges under the accounting guidance for derivative instruments and hedging activities. The primary objective of the Companyâs foreign currency exchange risk management program is to minimize the impact of currency movements due to transactions in other than the respective subsidiariesâ functional currency and to minimize the impact of currency movements on the Companyâs net investment denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar. To achieve this objective, the Company hedges a portion of known exposures using forward foreign exchange contracts.
Main foreign currency exposures are related to transactions denominated in the British Pound, Euro, Canadian dollar, Australian dollar, Mexican Peso, Chinese Yuan, Malaysian Ringgit and Singapore dollar. Generally, these risk management

transactions will involve the use of foreign currency derivatives to minimize the impact of currency movements on non-functional currency transactions.
The U.S. dollar equivalent notional amounts of outstanding forward exchange contracts were as follows as of JulyÂ 31, 2025 and 2024:

Cash Flow Hedges
The Company has designated a portion of its forward foreign exchange contracts as cash flow hedges and recorded these contracts at fair value on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. For these instruments, the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive income (âOCIâ) and reclassified into income in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects income. At 
JulyÂ 31, 2025
 and 2024, unrealized losses of $
493
 and $
124
 have been included in AOCI, respectively.
Net Investment Hedges
The Company has designated certain third party foreign currency denominated debt borrowed under its credit agreement as net investment hedges. These debt obligations, denominated in Euros and British Pounds, were designated as net investment hedges to hedge portions of the Company's net investment in its European operations. The Companyâs foreign currency denominated debt obligations are valued under a market approach using publicized spot prices, and the net gains or losses attributable to the changes in spot prices are recorded as cumulative translation within AOCI and are included in the foreign currency translation adjustments section of the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. As of 
JulyÂ 31, 2025
 and JulyÂ 31, 2024, the cumulative balance recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income were losses of $
2,753
 and $
1,237
, respectively, on any outstanding foreign currency denominated debt obligations.

The purchase price allocation was finalized in the fourth quarter of the year ended July 31, 2025. Measurement period adjustments did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated statement of income.

Controls and Procedures
Disclosure Controls and Procedures:
Brady Corporation maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports filed by the Company under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the âExchange Actâ), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECâs rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports the Company files under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Companyâs management, including the Companyâs principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The 
55
Table
 of Contents
Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including its President and Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Companyâs disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, the Companyâs President and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer concluded that the Companyâs disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of the end of the period covered by this report.
Managementâs Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting:
The management of Brady Corporation and its subsidiaries is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Companyâs internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
With the participation of the President and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of JulyÂ 31, 2025, based on the framework and criteria established in 
Internal Control â Integrated Framework (2013)
, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
.
 Consistent with guidance issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission that an assessment of a recently acquired business may be omitted from management's report on internal control over financial reporting in the year of acquisition, management excluded an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting related to Gravotech, AB&R and Microfluidic Solutions. The summation of the acquisitions represented 7.7% of the Company's consolidated total assets (excluding goodwill and intangible assets which were included in management's assessment of internal control over financial reporting) as of JulyÂ 31, 2025 and 9.4% of the consolidated net sales for the year ended JulyÂ 31, 2025. Based on the assessment, management concluded that, as of JulyÂ 31, 2025, the Companyâs internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.
Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
The Companyâs internal control over financial reporting, as of JulyÂ 31, 2025, has been audited by DeloitteÂ & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included herein.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting:
There were no changes in the Companyâs internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) that occurred during the Companyâs most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companyâs internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Brady Corporation
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Brady Corporation and subsidiaries (the âCompanyâ) as of July 31, 2025, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control â Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2025, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control â Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by COSO.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended July 31, 2025, of the Company and our report dated September 4, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.
As described in Managementâs Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting at Gravotech Holding (âGravotechâ), American Barcode and RFID Incorporated (âAB&Râ), and the Microfluidic Solutions business unit of Funai Electric Co., Ltd. (âMicrofluidic Solutionsâ), which were acquired on August 1, 2024, October 1, 2024, and April 1, 2025, respectively, and whose financial statements constitute 7.7% of total assets and 9.4% of net sales of the consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended July 31, 2025. Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting at Gravotech, AB&R, and Microfluidic Solutions.
Basis for Opinion
The Companyâs management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managementâs Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companyâs internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A companyâs internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companyâs internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companyâs assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Board Leadership Structure -
 The Board does not have a formal policy regarding the separation of the roles of Chief Executive Officer and Chair of the Board, as the Board believes it is in the best interest of the Company to make that determination based on the position and direction of the Company and the membership of the Board. Since September 2015, the Boardâs leadership structure has included a non-executive Chair of the Board of Directors. Mr. Richardson, an independent director, currently serves in the position of non-executive Chair of the Board. The duties of the non-executive Chair include, among others: chairing meetings of the Board and executive sessions of the non-management directors; meeting periodically with the Chief Executive Officer and consulting as necessary with management on issues facing the Company; facilitating effective communication among the Chief Executive Officer and all members of the Board; and overseeing the Board's shareholder communication policies and procedures.
The Board believes that its current leadership structure enhances the Board's oversight of, and independence from, Company management; the ability of the Board to carry out its roles and responsibilities on behalf of the Companyâs shareholders; and the Companyâs overall corporate governance.
Risk Oversight -
 The Board oversees the Company's risk management processes directly and through its committees. In general, the Board oversees the management of risks inherent in the operation of the Company's businesses, the implementation of its strategic plan, its acquisition and capital allocation program and its organizational structure. Each of the Board's committees also oversees the management of Company risks that fall within the respective committee's areas of responsibility. Specifically, cybersecurity is a critical part of risk management for the Company. The Audit Committee is aware of the rapidly evolving nature of threats presented by cybersecurity incidents and is committed to the prevention, timely detection, and mitigation of the effects of any such incidents on the Company. Additionally, the Audit Committee, Corporate Governance Committee, Management Development and Compensation Committee, and Technology Committee, each review certain risks, exposures and opportunities relating to the Companyâs ESG strategies, initiatives, policies and practices. The Company's management is responsible for reporting significant risks to executive management as a part of the disclosure process. The significance of the risk is assessed by executive management and escalated to the respective Board committee or the Board of Directors as deemed appropriate. The Company reviews its risk assessment with the Audit Committee annually. 
Audit Committee Financial Expert -
 The Board of Directors has determined that at least one Audit Committee financial expert is serving on its Audit Committee. Messrs. Hix, Chair of the Audit Committee; Allender, member of the Audit Committee; and Richardson, member of the Audit Committee, are financial experts under the rules of the SEC and financially literate and independent under the rules of the NYSE.
Director Independence -
 A majority of the directors must meet the criteria for independence established by the Board in accordance with the rules of the NYSE. In determining the independence of a director, the Board must find that a director has no relationship that may interfere with the exercise of his or her independence from management and the Company. In undertaking this determination with respect to the Companyâs directors other than Mr. Shaller, President and CEO, the Board considered the commercial relationships of the Company, if any, with those entities that have employed the Companyâs directors. The commercial relationships, which involved the purchase and sale of products on customary terms, did not exceed the maximum amounts proscribed by the director independence rules of the NYSE. Furthermore, the compensation paid to the Companyâs directors by their employers was not linked in any way to the commercial relationships their employers had with the Company. After consideration of these factors, the Board concluded that the commercial relationships were not material and did not prevent the Companyâs directors from being considered independent. Based on application of the NYSE independence criteria, all directors, with the exception of Mr. Shaller, are deemed independent. All members of the Audit, Management Development and Compensation, and Corporate Governance Committees are deemed independent.

Interested parties can raise concerns to be addressed at these meetings by calling the confidential Brady hotline at 1-877-781-9309.
Audit Committee Members -
 The Audit Committee, which is a separately-designated standing committee of the Board of Directors, is composed of Messrs. Hix (Chair), Allender, Bem and Richardson and Mses. Collins Smee and De Greef-Safft. Each member of the Audit Committee has been determined by the Board to be independent under the rules of the SEC and NYSE.

Fiscal 2025 Executive Summary
For fiscal 2025, the Board of Directors approved a 17.2% increase in base salary for Mr. Shaller. In addition, Mr. Shaller recommended and the Committee approved increases in base salary for Ms. Thornton and Messrs. Bojarski and Gorman. All increases were made to recognize the performance, current scope of responsibilities and peer company data for each executive.
The Company's fiscal 2025 annual equity grants consisted of 50% time-based restricted stock units (âRSUsâ) and 50% performance-based restricted stock units (âPRSUsâ) to align executive compensation with the creation of long-term shareholder value. The RSUs vest equally over three years and are intended to facilitate retention and align with the creation of long-term shareholder value. The PRSUs reinforce the Company's pay-for-performance philosophy because award payout increases and decreases based on Company performance. Specifically, the PRSU awards granted in fiscal 2025 will vest based on

Executive Compensation Practices
As part of the Company's pay-for-performance philosophy, the Company's compensation program includes several features that maintain alignment with shareholders:
65
Table
 of Contents
Emphasis on Variable Compensation
Â Â 
A significant portion of each NEO's total compensation opportunity is tied to Company performance, which is intended to drive shareholder value.
Ownership Requirements
Â Â 
The Company believes that the interests of shareholders and executives are aligned when executives are shareholders in possession of a meaningful amount of Company stock. Furthermore, stock ownership requirements encourage positive performance behaviors and discourage executive officers from taking excessive risk. In order to encourage our executive officers and directors to acquire and retain ownership of a significant number of shares of the Company's stock, stock ownership requirements have been established and are equal to a specified multiple of the executive officer's base salary. Our NEOs are expected to obtain the required ownership levels within five years of becoming an executive officer. Refer to the heading âStock Ownership Requirementsâ for further discussion of the stock ownership requirements established for each NEO and the actions that the Company may take when an executive is not in compliance with his or her respective stock ownership requirement.
Clawback Provisions
Â Â 
During fiscal 2024, the Committee adopted the Brady Corporation Incentive Recovery Policy, which requires the Company to recover the amount of erroneously awarded incentive-based compensation received by certain covered officers, including the NEOs, in the event of certain accounting restatements. The Incentive Recovery Policy satisfies NYSE listing requirements implementing SEC rules adopted under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street and Consumer Protection Act and applies to incentive-based compensation received on or after the effective date required by the listing requirements. The Incentive Recovery Policy is filed as Exhibit 97 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K and incorporated by reference. 
In addition to the Incentive Recovery Policy, there is a recoupment policy under which incentive compensation payments and/or awards may be recouped by the Company if such payments and/or awards were based on erroneous results. The recoupment policy applies to executive officers and other key executives who participate in any of the Company's incentive plans and i) have engaged in intentional misconduct that results in a material inaccuracy in the Company's financial statements, ii) have engaged in fraudulent or other willful and deliberate conduct that is detrimental to the Company or iii) there is a material, negative revision of a performance measure for which incentive compensation was paid or awarded. Under the recoupment policy, the Committee may take a variety of actions including, among others, seeking repayment of incentive compensation (cash and/or equity) that is greater than what would have been awarded if the compensation had been based on accurate results and the forfeiture of incentive compensation. As this policy suggests, the Committee believes that any incentive compensation should be based only on accurate and reliable financial and operational information, and, thus, any inappropriately paid incentive compensation should be returned to the Company for the benefit of shareholders. The Committee believes that this recoupment policy enhances the Company's compensation risk mitigation efforts.
Performance Thresholds and Caps
Â Â 
Excessive risk-taking is mitigated by utilizing caps on incentive plan payouts, multiple performance metrics, and different performance metrics for our annual cash incentive program and PRSUs. Our cash incentive awards are determined based on financial results for organic revenue,Â income before income taxes, division organic revenue and division operating income, which aggregate to a maximum payout of 200% of target. Executive officers then receive a performance rating that results in a multiplier ranging from 0% to 150%, resulting in a maximum payout of 300% of target.
We grant equity compensation to executive officers that promotes long-term financial and operating performance by delivering incremental value to the extent that our stock price increases over time. PRSUs incorporate Company performance relative to a benchmark over a three-year period and have a maximum payout of 200% of target.
Insider Trading and Anti-Hedging Policy
Â Â 
Our Insider Trading Policy prohibits executive officers from trading during certain periods each quarter until after we publicly disclose our financial and operating results. We may impose additional restricted trading periods at any time if we believe trading by executives would be inappropriate because of developments that are, or could be, material and which have not been publicly disclosed. The Insider Trading Policy also prohibits the pledging of Company stock as collateral for loans, holding Company securities in a margin account by officers, directors or employees, and the hedging of Company securities.
Annual Risk Reviews
Â Â 
The Company conducts an annual compensation-related risk review and presents findings and suggested risk mitigation actions to both the Audit and Management Development and Compensation Committees.
66
Table
 of Contents
The Companyâs compensation programs also maintain alignment with shareholders by not including certain features:
No Excessive Change of Control Payments
Â Â 
Messrs. Shaller, Bojarski and DeBruine and Ms. Thornton's maximum cash benefit is equal to two times their base salary and two times their target annual cash incentive in the year in which the termination occurs. For all other NEOs, their maximum cash benefit is equal to two times salary and two times the average annual cash incentive payment received in the three years immediately prior to the date the change of control occurs. In the event of a change of control, unexercised stock options become fully exercisable or, if canceled, each named executive officer shall be given cash or stock equal to the in-the-money value of the canceled stock options. In the event of a change of control, PRSUs and RSUs become fully vested at target.
No Reloads, Repricing, or Options Issued at a Discount
Â Â 
Stock options issued are not repriced, replaced, or regranted through cancellation or by lowering the option price of a previously granted option.
Policies and Practices Relating to the Timing of Equity Awards
We generally grant annual equity-based awards during the first quarter of our fiscal year based on the Committeeâs approval of the awards, although such timing may change from year to year. The Committee also may consider and approve interim or mid-year grants, or grants made on another basis, from time to time based on business needs, changing compensation practices or other factors, in the discretion of the Committee. The Committee does not take into account material nonpublic information in determining the timing and terms of equity-based awards, and we have not timed the disclosure of material nonpublic information for the purpose of affecting the value of executive compensation.
Compensation Philosophy and Objectives
We seek to align the interests of our executives with those of our shareholders by evaluating performance on the basis of key financial measurements that we believe closely correlate to long-term shareholder value. To this end, we have structured our compensation program to accomplish the following:
â¢
Allow the Company to attract, retain, motivate, develop and reward talented executives;
â¢
Deliver compensation plans that are both internally equitable when comparing similar roles and levels within the Company and externally competitive when comparing to the external market and the Companyâs designated peer group;
â¢
Maintain an appropriate balance between base salary and short-term and long-term incentive opportunities;
â¢
Provide integrated compensation programs aligned to the Companyâs annual and long-term financial goals and realized performance in order to reward the successful creation of long-term shareholder value;
â¢
Recognize and reward individual initiative and achievement with the amount of compensation each executive receives reflective of the executiveâs level of proficiency within his or her role and their level of sustained performance; and
â¢
Institute a pay-for-performance philosophy where the level of rewards is aligned to Company performance results.
Determining Compensation
Management Development & Compensation Committeeâs Role
The Committee is responsible for fulfilling the following responsibilities and duties:
â¢
Review, approve and monitor the compensation of the Company's CEO and executive officers
â¢
Review and approve corporate goals and objectives relevant to the CEO and executive officers and evaluate CEO and executive officer performance in light of those goals and objectives
â¢
Review and approve executive compensation, benefits, policies and strategies to support corporate objectives
â¢
Oversee the development process for executives and review development plans of key executives
â¢
Evaluate compensation programs, policies and practices for potential risk and to ensure they do not foster excessive risk taking
â¢
Administer the Company's equity incentive plans
â¢
Consult with management regarding executive compensation
On an annual basis with respect to executive officers, the Committee approves base salary adjustments, long-term equity incentive awards, the annual cash incentives paid for the achievement of performance metrics in the prior fiscal year and the annual cash incentive performance targets for the upcoming fiscal year. In addition, the Committee annually reviews a summary of the elements of compensation for each executive officer in order to evaluate, among other items, how a potential change to an element of our compensation program would affect the respective executive officer's overall compensation. When a new 
67
Table
 of Contents
executive officer is hired, the Committee is involved in reviewing and approving base salary, annual incentive target, sign-on incentives, annual equity awards, and other aspects of the executive's compensation.
Consultant's Role
The Committee has historically utilized the services of an executive compensation consulting firm to assist with the review and evaluation of compensation leve
ls and policies on a periodic basis, as well as to provide advice with respect to new or modified compensation programs. In fiscal 2025, the Committee utilized the services of Pearl Meyer as their compensation consultant, which was determined to be independent by the Corporate Governance Committee. In fiscal 2025, the compensation consultant completed an analysis of the Company's current compensation peer group, reviewed the Company's short-term and long-term incentive framework relative to market trends and the Company's strategy and objectives, completed a peer group review of CEO annual total compensation, presented to the Board of Directors any significant regulatory changes and executive compensation trends, and worked on ad hoc compensation-related requests from the Management Development & Compensation Committee throughout the year.
Managementâs Role
To aid in determining compensation f
or fiscal 2025, management obtained compensation data on peer group executive officer compensation through a subscription with Equilar, Inc. and published survey data from various third parties. Our CEO, Mr. Shaller, used this data to make recommendations to the Committee concerning compensation for each executive officer other than himself. Mr. Shaller made no recommendation with respect to his own compensation. In setting compensation for each executive officer, the Committee takes into consideration these recommendations, along with Company results during the fiscal year, the level of responsibility and demonstrated leadership capability, third-party market compensation data, and the results of annual performance reviews which, for our CEO, included a self-assessment and feedback from his direct reports and each member of the Board of Directors. The Committee also took into consideration the recommendations of Pearl Meyer with respect to compensation elements for the CEO. Mr. Shaller did not attend the portion of 
any meeting during which the Committee discussed matters related specifically to his compensation.
Elements of Compensation
Our total compensation program includes five elements: base salary, annual cash incentives, long-term equity incentives, employee benefits, and perquisites. We use these elements of compensation to attract, retain, motivate, develop and reward our executives.
Our compensation philosophy is to allocate a significant portion of total compensation to long-term compensation (equity incentive awards) in order to align the achievement of performance goals for our executives with shareholder interests. For fiscal 2025, equity incentive awards comprised 70% of Mr. Shallerâs total target compensation in his role as President, Chief Executive Officer and Director of the Company and on average, 43% of the total target compensation of the other NEOs.

Table
 of Contents
In general, we target each NEO's total of base salary, annual cash incentive, and long-term equity incentive compensation elements to be at or near the market median (50th percentile) with an opportunity for above market median pay (generally up to the 75th percentile) if performance goals for annual and long-term incentives are achieved above target. Our compensation structure is balanced by the payment of below market median compensation to our NEOs when actual financial results or individual performance do not meet expected results. The following table describes the purpose of each compensation element and how that element is related to our pay-for-performance approach:
Compensation Element
Â 
Purpose 
Â 
Performance Alignment
Base salary
Â 
A fixed level of income used to attract and retain executives by compensating for the primary functions and responsibilities of the position.
Â 
Base salary increase depends upon individual performance, job proficiency and market competitiveness.
Annual cash incentive award
Â 
To attract, retain, motivate and reward executives for achieving or exceeding annual performance goals at total Company and division levels.
Â 
Financial performance and individual performance of each executive determines the amount of the respective executive's annual cash incentive award.
Annual long-term equity incentive awards: RSUs and PRSUs
Â 
To attract, retain, motivate and reward executives for the successful creation of long-term shareholder value.
Â 
An assessment of executive leadership, experience and expected future contribution, combined with market data, are used to determine the amount of equity granted to each executive.
RSUs are intended to facilitate retention and to align executives with the creation of long-term shareholder value.
PRSUs are intended to align executives with long-term financial goals and the creation of long-term shareholder value.
Benchmarking Total Compensation
The Committee uses peer group data to assess the reasonableness and competitiveness of several elements of compensation, including base salaries, annual cash incentives, and long-term equity awards of positions similar to those of our NEOs. The guiding principles of the Company's peer group company selection process includes considerations for company size and scope, industry focus, operational scope, product and workforce. The following 18 companies were included in the fiscal 2025 total compensation analysis conducted using publicly available data:
Albany International Corp.
Franklin Electric Co., Inc.
Methode Electronics, Inc.

Annual Cash Incentive Awards
All executives participate in an annual cash incentive plan. The Company is organized and managed on a global basis within
 two segments: Americas & Asia and Europe & Australia
. Annual cash incentive award payouts to Mr. Bojarski, President of Americas & Asia, are primarily based on segment performance. Payouts to the other NEOs are based on total company performance.

Management and the Committee annually evaluate the performance metrics of the cash incentive award program, and concluded that the elements of the fiscal 2025 plan represent critical elements of the Companyâs performance that when combined, are designed to result in sustainable long-term sales and profit growth. Set forth below is a description of the fiscal 2025 financial performance metrics for the annual cash incentive plan:

The funding level of the fiscal 2025 annual cash incentive plan was determined based on the level of achievement of the annual sales and profit metrics described above compared to stated thresholds that were established at the beginning of the fiscal year. These thresholds are set forth in the tables below for each NEO. The annual cash incentive plan also includes a minimum profit threshold that must be exceeded in order for any cash incentive amount to be funded, regardless of the achievement of revenue. In addition, plan participants must be employed on the payment date to receive the payout of their annual incentive award.
Individual contribution is determined by assessing the level of achievement of each NEOâs individual annual goals combined with his or her ability to deliver on the competencies needed to achieve those goals. The competencies include items such as optimizing work processes through continuous improvement initiatives, building strong customer relationships and providing excellent customer service, creating innovative new product solutions, valuing different perspectives and developing our people. Individual annual goals and competencies are included in each NEOâs performance assessment to ensure they are focused on initiatives within their area of responsibility that will increase both sales and profitability and drive long-term shareholder value.
While our objective is to set goals that are quantitative and measurable, certain elements of the performance assessment may be subjective. Assessments and rating recommendations for all executive officers, except the CEO, are delivered to the Committee by the CEO in July. The CEO provides the Committee with a self-assessment of his own performance without a

rating recommendation and the Committee conducts an annual review and evaluation process to determine the CEO's performance rating.
The Company's rating system consists of five performance level ranges that are applied to the available annual cash incentive that is earned and payable based upon the NEO's contribution to the fiscal year objectives and their individual annual goals: Unsatisfactory - 0%; Needs Improvement - 50%; Fully Meets Objectives - 75% to 110%; Exceeds Objectives - 95% to 125%; and Outstanding - 120% to 150%. The annual cash incentive target is calculated as a percentage of the NEOâs eligible compensation, which is defined as base salary paid during the fiscal year. The achievement of the financial performance metrics defined in the table above is applied to this target for each NEO, and their individual performance rating is then applied, resulting in the annual cash incentive award. The following sections detail this calculation for each NEO.
Messrs. Shaller, DeBruine and Gorman and Ms. Thornton
The cash incentive payable to Messrs. Shaller, DeBruine and Gorman and Ms. Thornton for fiscal 2025 was based on total sales and income before income taxes. For fiscal 2025, an annual cash incentive was funded for the achievement of total sales and income before income taxes. The multiplier for individual performance was applied to the two components to arrive at the final cash incentive award achieved.
The threshold, target, maximum and actual cash incentive award earned for Messrs. Shaller, DeBruine and Gorman and Ms. Thornton were as follows:

Long-Term Equity Incentive Awards
For fiscal 2025, the Committee reviewed historical award sizes and median levels of equity awarded to similar positions at our peer companies and other relevant market data. The Committee then approved the fiscal 2025 awards consisting of a combination of RSUs and PRSUs to align executive compensation with the creation of long-term shareholder value. The Committee uses its discretion in combination with peer group data, analysis of actual pay and performance, and advice from its independent compensation consultant to determine the size and type of equity awards granted to the CEO. For all other executives, the Committee also considers the input from the CEO when determining the size and type of annual equity awards. 
RSUs: 
RSUs generally vest one-third annually for three years. The Committee has the ability to vary the vesting schedule for new RSU grants in accordance with the terms of the plan. All RSUs are granted following the Committee's approval, with a fair value equal to the average of the high and low stock price on the grant date.
PRSUs: 
PRSUs granted in fiscal 2025 include two vesting criteria: 50% of the shares vest based on diluted EPS targets, and 50% of the shares vest based on revenue performance. Each of these metrics is based on achievement over four separate performance periods as discussed in the Executive Summary. The diluted EPS performance measure aligns executive compensation with the creation of long-term shareholder value. If threshold performance is not achieved for a particular performance period, then no award will vest relative to that performance period. PRSUs will vest between 0% and 200% of target depending on the relative three-year achievement of revenue and diluted EPS growth goals over the respective performance periods.
No dividends are paid or accrued on the RSUs or PRSUs prior to the issuance of shares.

The target performance and baseline have been adjusted to reflect divestitures. As the Company divested businesses in fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2024, the corresponding baseline and target performance has been adjusted for these performance periods. The Company's target performance was a CAGR of 6% for each of these years.
During fiscal year 2025, the Management Development and Compensation Committee approved a modification to the performance vesting conditions for the above awards. Specifically, the performance metrics for a portion of the PRSU awards granted in fiscal year 2023 were adjusted to include revenue from acquisitions in the achievement of the revenue target. This is considered a Type III modification under ASC Topic 718, âShare-Based Paymentâ as the modification resulted in a change to the probability of vesting from improbable to probable. The Management Development and Compensation Committee made the decision to align these awards with the PRSUs granted in fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2025, which include the revenue from acquisitions as part of the performance metric. There was no modification made to the portion of awards vesting based on the TSR metric. The PRSUs achieved a total payout of 84%, with half the awards vesting based on the TSR metric, and the other half vesting based on the revenue growth metric.
Other Elements of Compensation
Health and Welfare Benefits:
 We provide subsidized health and welfare benefits which include medical, dental, life and disability insurance and paid time off. Executive officers are entitled to participate in our health and welfare plans on generally the same terms and conditions as other employees, subject to limitations under applicable law. In addition, the Company maintains a supplemental long-term disability policy for its U.S. executives. The supplemental long-term disability policy provides for an additional 15% of compensation, up to a maximum additional benefit of $5,000 per month. Brady pays the premiums for these benefits; therefore, these benefits represent taxable benefits to the executive.
Retirement Benefits:
 Brady employees (including NEOs) in the United States and certain expatriate employees working for its international subsidiaries are eligible to participate in the Brady Corporation Matched 401(k) Plan (the âMatched 401(k) Planâ). NEOs in the United States and employees at certain United States locations are also eligible to participate in the Brady Corporation Funded Retirement Plan (âFunded Retirement Planâ). In addition, certain Brady international employees are eligible to participate in Company sponsored statutory and supplementary defined benefit pension plans that are primarily unfunded and provide an income benefit upon termination or retirement.
75
Table
 of Contents
The Funded Retirement Plan is a defined contribution plan through which the Company contributes 4% of the annual wages of each eligible participant. In addition, participants may elect to defer up to 5% of their annual wages into the Matched 401(k) Plan, which is matched up to an additional 4% contribution from the Company. Participants may elect to contribute an additional 45% of their eligible earnings to their Matched 401(k) Plan account without an additional matching contribution from the Company, which is subject to specified maximum limits allowed by the Internal Revenue Service (âIRSâ). The assets of the Matched 401(k) Plan and Funded Retirement Plan credited to each participant are invested by the trustee of the Plans as directed by each plan participant in a variety of investment funds as permitted by the Plans. Participants in the Matched 401(k) Plan become fully vested in employer contributions over a two-year period of continuous service. Employer contributions to the Funded Retirement Plan become fully vested over a six-year period of continuous service.
Benefits are generally payable upon the death, disability, or retirement of the participant, or upon termination of employment before retirement, although benefits may be withdrawn from the Matched 401(k) Plan and paid to the participant in certain circumstances. Under certain specified circumstances, the Matched 401(k) Plan allows a participant to withdraw loans on their account.
Deferred Compensation Arrangements:
 The Company has two deferred compensation plans, the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan and the Director Deferred Compensation Plan, that allow for compensation to be deferred into either the Companyâs Class A Nonvoting Common Stock or other investment funds. Both the Director Deferred Compensation and the Executive Deferred Compensation Plans disallow transfers from other investment funds into the Companyâs Class A Nonvoting Stock, and both disallow transfers from the Companyâs Class A Nonvoting Stock into other investment funds. The assets in both deferred compensation plans are held in a Rabbi Trust and are invested by the trustee as directed by the participant. Executives and directors may elect whether to receive their account balance following termination of employment in a single lump sum payment or by means of distribution under an annual installment method. Distributions of the Companyâs Class A Nonvoting Common Stock are made in-kind; distributions of mutual funds are made in cash.
Executives are eligible to participate in the Brady Restoration Plan, which is a non-qualified deferred compensation plan that allows an equivalent benefit to the Matched 401(k) Plan and the Funded Retirement Plan for executives' income exceeding the IRS limits of participation in a qualified 401(k) plan. 
Perquisites:
 Brady generally provides executives with the following perquisites:
â¢
Financial planning and tax preparation;
â¢
Company car or car allowance;
â¢
Physical examination;
â¢
Long-term care insurance; and
â¢
Personal liability insurance.
Stock Ownership Requirements
In order to encourage our executive officers and directors to acquire and retain ownership of a significant number of shares of the Company's stock, stock ownership requirements have been established.
The Board of Directors has established the following stock ownership requirements for our NEOs:
R.R. Shaller
Â 
5 times base salary
A.E. Thornton
Â 
3 times base salary
O. Bojarski
3 times base salary
T.F. DeBruine
3 times base salary
A.T. Gorman
Â 
2 times base salary
Our NEOs are expected to meet their ownership requirement within five years of becoming an executive officer and may not sell shares, other than to cover tax withholding requirements associated with the vesting or exercise of an equity award, until such time as they meet the requirements. All NEOs were in compliance with their respective ownership requirements as of July 31, 2025. If an executive does not meet his or her ownership requirement within five years, the Committee may direct that the executive's after-tax payout on any incentive plans will be in Class A Nonvoting Common Stock in order to satisfy the executiveâs ownership requirement.
Actual stock ownership of each NEO is reviewed on an annual basis to ensure the guidelines are met.

value of vested and âin the moneyâ stock options. The fair market value of PRSUs are excluded from the determination of executive ownership levels.
Insider Trading and Anti-Hedging Policy
The Company's Insider Trading Policy prohibits hedging and other monetization transactions in Company securities by officers, directors and employees. The prohibition of hedging transactions includes financial instruments such as prepaid variable forwards, equity swaps, collars and exchange funds. The Insider Trading Policy also prohibits the pledging of Company stock as collateral for loans or holding Company securities in a margin account by officers, directors or employees.
Employment and Change of Control Agreements
Employment Offer Letter
Mr. Shaller has an employment offer letter providing for certain severance benefits, as described below under âPotential Payments Upon Termination or Change of Control.â None of the other NEOs have any severance agreements or similar arrangements that would apply outside of a change of control.
Change of Control Agreements
The Board of Directors previously approved change of control agreements for all of the NEOs of the Company. The agreements applicable to the NEOs provide a payment of an amount commensurate to a multiple of their salary and annual cash incentive payment, as specified in their respective agreement, prior to the date the change of control occurs in the event of termination or resignation for good cause upon a change of control. All of the NEO's agreements provide for up to $25,000 of attorney fees to enforce the executive's rights under the agreement. Payments under the agreement will be made over two years.
Under the terms of the 2017 and 2023 Omnibus Incentive Plans, in the event of (a) the merger or consolidation of the Company with or into another corporation or corporations in which the Company is not the surviving corporation, (b) the adoption of any plan for the dissolution of the Company, or (c) the sale or exchange of all or substantially all the assets of the Company for cash or for shares of stock or other securities of another corporation, all then-unexercised stock options become fully exercisable and all restrictions placed on restricted stock, and performance-based and time-based restricted stock units will lapse. If any stock option is canceled subsequent to the events described above, the Company or the corporation assuming the obligations of the Company, shall pay an amount of cash or stock equal to the in-the-money value of the canceled stock options. The awards granted under the 2017 and 2023 Omnibus Incentive Plans provide for either accelerated or continuation of vesting of stock options and RSUs upon termination due to retirement, for which the eligibility criteria is 60 years of age and 5 years of service.
Non-Compete/Non-Solicitation/Confidentiality
Equity awards under the Company's 2017 and 2023 Omnibus Incentive Plans contain non-competition, non-solicitation and confidential information covenants applicable to the award recipients. The confidential information covenant prohibits the use, disclosure, copying or duplication of the Company's confidential information other than in the course of authorized activities conducted in the course of the recipient's employment with the Company. The other covenants prohibit the NEOs for 12 months after termination of employment with the Company, from (i) performing duties for or as a competitor of the Company which are the same or similar to those performed by the recipient in the 24 months prior to termination of employment with the Company, (ii) soliciting customers for the sale of competitive products, (iii) soliciting employees to join a competitor or otherwise terminate their relationship with the Company, or (iv) interfering in the Company's relationships with its vendors and suppliers.
Tax Considerations
Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code generally disallows a federal income tax deduction to publicly traded companies for compensation in excess of $1Â million per year paid to certain current and former executive officers. Historically, the $1Â million deduction limit generally has not applied to compensation that satisfies IRS requirements for qualified performance-based compensation.
The Committee's intent is to preserve the deductibility of executive compensation to the extent reasonably practicable and to the extent consistent with its other compensation objectives. However, the Committee believes SectionÂ 162(m) is only one of several relevant considerations in establishing executive compensation and believes Section 162(m) implications should not compromise its ability to design and maintain executive compensation arrangements intended to, among other things, attract, motivate and help retain a highly qualified and successful management team to lead the Company. As a result, the Committee 
77
Table
 of Contents
retains the flexibility to provide compensation it determines to be in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders even if that compensation ultimately is not tax deductible.
Accounting Considerations
When reviewing preliminary recommendations and in connection with approving the terms of a given incentive plan, management and the Committee review and consider the accounting implications of a compensation arrangement, including the estimated expense and other accounting and disclosure requirements. With consideration of the accounting treatment associated with an incentive plan design, management and the Committee may alter or modify the incentive award if the award and the related accounting consequences were to adversely affect our financial performance.
Management Development and Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation
During fiscal 2025, the Committee was composed of Mses. Collins-Smee and Bruno and Messrs. Bem, Richardson and Nargolwala. There are no relationships among the Company's executive officers, members of the Committee or entities whose executives serve on the Board that require disclosure under applicable SEC regulations.
Management Development and Compensation Committee Report
The Committee has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis with management; based on the review and discussions, the Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Compensation Policies and Practices
The Company believes that its compensation policies, practices, and procedures for executive officers and all other employees are designed to avoid incentives that create unnecessary or excessive risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. The Company's compensation programs are weighted towards offering long-term incentives that reward sustainable performance; do not offer significant short-term incentives that might drive high-risk investments at the expense of long-term Company value; and are set at reasonable and sustainable levels, as determined by a review of the Company's economic position, as well as the compensation offered by comparable companies. Under the oversight of its Audit and Management Development and Compensation Committees, the Company reviewed its compensation policies, practices and procedures for all employees, including executive officers, to evaluate and ensure that they did not foster risk-taking beyond that deemed acceptable within the Company's business model.

Represents the grant date fair value of RSUs and PRSUs computed in accordance with accounting guidance for equity grants made or modified in the applicable year. The grant date fair value of RSUs is calculated based on the number of shares of Class A Common Stock underlying the RSUs times the average of the high and low stock price of Class A Common Stock on the date of grant. The grant date fair value of PRSUs was calculated based on the number of shares of Class A Common Stock underlying the award times the average of the high and low stock price of Class A Common Stock on the date of grant. The actual value of a RSU will depend on the market value of the Class A Common Stock on the date the stock is sold. The table reflects the grant date fair value at target for PRSUs (100%). The values of the PRSU awards in fiscal 2025 at the grant date if the highest level of performance conditions were to be achieved would be as follows: Mr. Shaller, $4,800,008; Ms. Thornton, $800,026; Mr. Bojarski, $750,014; Mr. DeBruine, $475,028; and Mr. Gorman, $350,074.

Represents annual cash incentives earned during the listed fiscal years, which was paid during the next fiscal year. 
(3)
The amounts in the 'All Other Compensation' column include: matching contributions to the Companyâs Matched 401(k) Plan, Funded Retirement Plan and Restoration Plan, company car or car allowance, the cost of group term life insurance, the cost of long-term care insurance, the cost of disability insurance and other compensation or perquisites. The other compensation includes pay related to severance agreements, settlement agreements and other perquisites including annual allowances for financial and tax planning and the cost of personal liability insurance. Refer to the table following these footnotes.

Upon his appointment to President, Chief Executive Officer and Director on April 1, 2022, Mr. Shaller was awarded $760,500 of stock options and $760,500 of RSUs. In addition, Mr. Shaller was granted an additional $250,000 RSU award at this time. The $760,500 stock option and $760,500 RSU grants related to an early grant of Mr. Shaller's fiscal 2023 equity awards, so he did not receive any stock options or RSUs during fiscal 2023. As such, fiscal 2024 was the first year in which Mr. Shaller received his full Chief Executive Officer compensation and benefits.
(5)
Ms. Thornton was appointed as Chief Financial Officer, Chief Accounting Officer and Treasurer effective April 14, 2023. As part of her appointment, Ms. Thornton received a base salary of $450,000. In fiscal 2024, Ms. Thornton began receiving equity awards and other incentive benefits corresponding to her appointment as Chief Financial Officer.
(6)
As discussed within the PRSU achievement section above, the Management Development and Compensation Committee approved a modification to certain outstanding stock awards to align their performance vesting conditions with current grant design and evolving business priorities. Specifically, the performance metrics for a portion of the PRSU awards granted in fiscal year 2023 were adjusted to include acquisitions from newly acquired companies in the achievement of the revenue target. In the Summary Compensation Table above, this incremental fair value is included 
79
Table

in the âStock Awardsâ column for each named executive officer who received the modified awards. The amounts reported in this column reflect the new grant date fair value based on the market price (average of the high and low of the stock price) on the date of the modification, as well as the amount expected to vest under the revised performance conditions. The value of the modification included in the âStock Awardsâ column for fiscal year 2025 is as follows: Mr. Shaller, $190,172; Mr. DeBruine $15,009; and Mr. Gorman $18,948.

At its July 2024 meeting, the Committee approved the values of the annual cash incentive award threshold, target and maximums under the Company's annual cash incentive plan. The structure of the plan is described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis above and was set prior to the beginning of the fiscal year.
(2)
This award represents PRSUs granted August 1, 2024, as part of the annual fiscal 2025 equity grant. These PRSUs have a three-year performance period with the number of shares issued at vesting determined by the Company's achievement of revenue and diluted EPS growth goals over the three-year performance period. Payout opportunities will range from 0% to 200% of the target award. Target payout is set at 100% of award value, with threshold and maximum payouts set at 25% and 200% of target award value, respectively.
(3)
The RSU awards vest equally over three years.
(4)
The base price for the RSU and PRSU awards is the average of the high and low prices of the Companyâs ClassÂ A Common Stock as reported by the NYSE on the date of the grant.
(5)
As discussed in the Summary Compensation Table, the portion of the fiscal 2023 PRSU awards that have a performance vesting condition were modified in fiscal 2025. The above amounts represent the incremental fair value recognized as part of the modification based on the market on the date of the modification. The shares listed within represent the original shares granted to each of Mr. Shaller, Mr. DeBruine and Mr. Gorman.

The executive contribution amounts included in this table are derived from the Salary and Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation columns of the Summary Compensation Table. The Company's contribution amounts included in this table are reported in the All Other Compensation columns of the Summary Compensation Table. Amounts reported in the aggregate balance at July 31, 2025, net of historical earnings and losses were previously reported as compensation to the NEO in the Summary Compensation Table for previous years. See discussion of the Company's non-qualified deferred compensation plans in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis.
Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change of Control
As described in the Employment and Change of Control Agreements section of the Compensation Discussion and Analysis above, the Company has entered into an employment offer letter with Mr. Shaller and change of control agreements with all of the NEOs that provide for benefits following termination of employment and/or a change of control. In addition, our equity incentive plans provide for certain potential benefits upon a change of control.
The offer letter entered into with Mr. Shaller provides that he is deemed an at-will employee but will receive a severance benefit equal to equal to two times the sum of his base salary and target bonus, payable in monthly installments over a 24-month period, in the event his employment is terminated without cause or he resigns for good reason as described therein. The offer letter also contains 24-month non-competition and non-solicitation provisions, as well as standard confidentiality and non-disparagement provisions. None of the other NEOs have any severance agreements or similar arrangements that would apply outside of a change of control.
84
Table
 of Contents
The terms of the change of control agreement are triggered if, within a 24-month period beginning with the date a change of control occurs, (i)Â the executiveâs employment with the Company is involuntarily terminated other than by reason of death, disability or cause, or (ii)Â the executiveâs employment with the Company is voluntarily terminated by the executive subsequent to (a)Â any reduction in the total of the executiveâs annual base salary, exclusive of fringe benefits, and the executiveâs target annual cash incentive in comparison with the executiveâs annual base salary and target annual cash incentive immediately prior to the date the change of control occurs, (b)Â a significant diminution in the responsibilities or authority of the executive in comparison with the executiveâs responsibility and authority immediately prior to the date the change of control occurs, or (c)Â the imposition of a requirement by the Company that the executive relocate to a principal work location more than 50 miles from the executiveâs principal work location immediately prior to the date the change of control occurs.
Following termination due to a change of control, executives shall be paid a multiplier of their annual base salary in effect immediately prior to the date the change of control occurs plus a multiplier of their annual cash incentive payment as discussed in their respective change of control agreements prior to the date the change of control occurs, payable in monthly installments over a 24-month period. If the payments upon termination due to change of control result in any excise tax being incurred by Messrs. Shaller, Bojarski, DeBruine and Gorman and Ms. Thornton as a result of SectionÂ 280G of the Internal Revenue Code, the officer will be solely responsible for such excise tax. The Company will also reimburse a maximum of $25,000 of legal fees incurred by the executives in order to enforce the change of control agreement, in which the executive prevails. The Company's change of control agreements contain confidentiality provisions.
The following information and tables set forth the amount of payments to each NEO in the event of termination of employment as a result of a change of control.
 
No other employment agreements providing specified payments upon termination have been entered into between the Company and any of the NEOs in fiscal year 2025. 
Assumptions and General Principles
The following assumptions and general principles apply with respect to the tables that follow in this section.
â¢
The amounts detailed in the tables assume that each NEO terminated employment on JulyÂ 31, 2025. Accordingly, the tables reflect amounts earned as of JulyÂ 31, 2025, and include estimates of amounts that would be paid to the NEO upon the termination or occurrence of a change of control. The actual amounts that would be paid to an NEO can only be determined at the time of termination.
â¢
The tables below include amounts the Company is obligated to pay the NEO as a result of the severance agreement and executed change of control agreement or under the applicable equity incentive plan. The tables do not include benefits that are paid generally to all salaried employees or a broad group of salaried employees. Therefore, the NEOs would receive benefits in addition to those set forth in the tables. 
â¢
An NEO is entitled to receive base salary earned during their term of employment regardless of the manner in which the named executive officerâs employment is terminated. As such, this amount is not disclosed in the tables.

CEO Pay Ratio Disclosure
Summarized below is the ratio of the total compensation of our CEO, Russell R. Shaller, to the total compensation of our median employee.
For fiscal 2025:
â¢
the median of the annual total compensation of all of our employees, other than the CEO, was $55,173; and
â¢
the annual total compensation of our CEO, as reported in the Summary Compensation Table, was $
7,597,366
.
Accordingly, the ratio of the CEOâs annual total compensation to the median of the annual total compensation of all other employees was approximately 138:1.
For our median employee, we elected to use the same employee identified as the median employee in fiscal 2024 for calculating the pay ratio in fiscal 2025. There were no material changes in our employee population or compensation arrangements that we reasonably believe would result in a significant change in our pay ratio disclosures since we identified the median employee for determination of the CEO pay ratio in fiscal 2024. 
To identify our median in 2024, as well as to determine the annual total compensation of our median employee in 2025, we used the following methodology and assumptions:
â¢
A measurement date of May 31, 2024 was used to identify our median employee, which is within three months of the Company's fiscal 2024 year end. As of this date, the Company's total employee population, excluding the CEO, consisted of 5,660 individuals, which comprised all full-time and part-time employees. 
â¢
The employee population consisted of 5,660 individuals, of which 1,577 were in the United States and 4,083 were outside of the United States.
â¢
The Company used annual total cash compensation earned by our employees, as compiled from our payroll records, as the consistently applied compensation measure by which to determine the median employee. This reflects the principal forms of compensation delivered to all of our employees and is readily available in each country.
â¢
We annualized the compensation of employees for the full fiscal year and for employees hired during the fiscal year.
â¢
For employees outside of the United States, we used applicable currency exchange rates based on the average exchange rate over the period to convert all compensation data.
â¢
Our median employee's total compensation for 2025 was calculated in the same manner as total compensation for each of the NEOs within the Summary Compensation Table and includes contributions to health and welfare benefits.

Table
 of Contents
Pay Versus Performance
The following Pay Versus Performance table summarizes compensation for our principal executive officers (âPEOsâ) and the average compensation amounts to all other non-PEO NEOs as reported in the Summary Compensation Table (âSCTâ) for the past five fiscal years, as well as amounts for Compensation Actually Paid (âCAPâ) to these groups calculated and reported as required under new SEC disclosure requirements. The below table also includes the Company's Total Shareholder Return (âTSRâ) results, Peer Group TSR, net income and the Company selected performance measure - 
Operating Income
. We have selected Operating Income as our primary financial measure we consider to be most important in linking performance to compensation actually paid as the Company's overall NEO compensation structure is designed to drive profitable growth leading to long-term shareholder value creation.

Board of Directors Compensation
To ensure competitive compensation for the Board of Directors, compensation is reviewed every other year and market surveys prepared by various consulting firms and the National Association of Corporate Directors are reviewed by the Corporate Governance Committee and the Management Development and Compensation Committee, and they confer with the Boardâs independent compensation consultant in making recommendations to the Board of Directors regarding director compensation. Directors who are employees of the Company receive no additional compensation for service on the Board or on any committee of the Board.
In fiscal 2025, the annual cash retainer paid to non-management directors was $72,500. Each member of the Audit Committee received an annual retainer of $15,000, and an additional annual retainer of $15,000 was paid to the Chair of the Audit Committee; each member of the Management Development and Compensation Committee received an annual retainer of $12,000, and an additional annual retainer of $12,000 was paid to the Chair; and each member of the Corporate Governance, Finance and Technology Committees received an annual retainer of $10,000, and an additional annual retainer of $10,000 was paid to each committee chair. Non-management directors do not receive meeting fees. The annual cash retainers are pro-rated in situations where there are changes to committee members or committee chairs that take place during the fiscal year. Non-management directors are eligible to receive compensation of up to $1,000 per day for special assignments required by management or the Board of Directors, so long as the compensation does not impair independence and is approved by the Board as required. No such special assignment fees were paid in fiscal year 2025.
In fiscal 2025, the Chair of the Board, Bradley C. Richardson, was paid an annual fee of $100,000.
The Board has established stock ownership requirements for directors. The ownership requirement for each director is five times the annual Board retainer. Directors have five years to achieve their stock ownership requirements. Mr. Hix (elected to the Board in May 2024) and Mses. Cusack (elected to the Board in September 2024) and De Greef-Safft (elected to the Board in February 2025) have not yet met their stock ownership requirements. All other directors have met their stock ownership requirements.
Under the terms of the Brady Corporation 2023 Omnibus Incentive Stock Plan, 5,000,000 shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock have been authorized for issuance to directors and employees. The Board has full and final authority to designate the non-management directors to whom awards will be granted, the date on which awards will be granted and the number of shares of stock covered by each grant.
On May 20, 2024, the Board approved an annual stock-based compensation award of $135,000 fair value of unrestricted shares of Class A Common Stock with a grant date fair value of $74.63 per share, for each non-management director, effective October 2, 2024.
Directors are also eligible to defer portions of their fees into the Brady Corporation Director Deferred Compensation Plan (âDirector Deferred Compensation Planâ), the value of which is measured by the fair value of the underlying investments. The assets of the Director Deferred Compensation Plan are held in a Rabbi Trust and are invested by the trustee as directed by the participant in several investment funds as permitted by the Director Deferred Compensation Plan. The investment funds available include Brady Corporation Class A Nonvoting Common Stock and various mutual funds that are offered in the employee Matched 401(k) Plan. Directors may elect whether to receive their account balance following termination in a single lump sum payment or by means of distribution under an annual installment method. Distributions of the Brady Corporation Class A Nonvoting Common Stock are made in-kind; distributions of mutual funds are made in cash.

ItemÂ 13.
 
Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence
The Company annually solicits information from its directors in order to ensure there are no conflicts of interest. The information gathered annually is reviewed by the Company and if any transactions are not in accordance with the rules of the NYSE or are potentially in violation of the Companyâs Corporate Governance Principles, the transactions are referred to the Corporate Governance Committee for approval or other action. Further, potential affiliated party transactions would be reported as a part of the Companyâs quarterly disclosure process. In addition, pursuant to its charter, the Companyâs Audit Committee periodically reviews reports and disclosures of insider and affiliated party transaction with the Company, if any. Furthermore, the Companyâs directors are expected to be mindful of their fiduciary obligations to the Company and to report any potential conflicts to the Corporate Governance Committee for review. Based on the Companyâs consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances, the Corporate Governance Committee will decide whether or not to approve such transactions and will approve only those transactions that are in the best interest of the Company. Additionally, the Company has processes in place to educate executives and employees about affiliated transactions. The Company maintains an anonymous hotline by which employees may report potential conflicts of interest such as affiliated party transactions.
In undertaking its review of potential related party transactions, the Board considered the commercial relationships of the Company, if any, with those entities that have employed the Companyâs directors. The commercial relationships, which involved the purchase and sale of products on customary terms, did not exceed the maximum amounts proscribed by the director independence rules of the NYSE. Furthermore, the compensation paid to the Companyâs directors by their employers was not linked in any way to the commercial relationships their employers had with the Company in fiscal 2025. After consideration of these factors, the Board concluded that none of the directors whose employers had a commercial relationship with the Company had a material interest in the transactions and the commercial relationships were not material to the Company. Based on these factors, the Company has determined that it does not have material related party transactions that affect the results of operations, cash flow or financial condition. The Company has also determined that no transactions occurred in fiscal 2025, or are currently proposed, that would require disclosure under Item 404 (a) of Regulation S-K.
See Item 10 above for a discussion of director independence.
