our expectations regarding our reve
nue and the timing of revenue recognition under our customer contracts, ex
penses and other operating results;

•
the anticipated benefits or effects of any completed or future acquisitions or international expansion.
You should not rely on forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. We have based the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K primarily on our current expectations and projections about future events and trends that we believe may affect our business, financial condition and operating results. The outcome of the events described in these forward-looking statements is subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors described in the section titled “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all risks and uncertainties that could have an impact on the forward-looking statements contained in this report. The results, events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements may not be achieved or occur, and actual results, events or circumstances could differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements.
In addition, statements that “we believe” and similar statements reflect our beliefs and opinions on the relevant subject. These statements are based on information available to us as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and are inherently uncertain. While we believe that information provides a reasonable basis for these statements, that information may be limited or incomplete. Our statements should not be read to indicate that we have conducted an exhaustive inquiry into, or review of, all relevant information.
The forward-looking statements made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K relate only to events as of the date on which the statements are made. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K or to reflect new information or the occurrence of unanticipated events, except as required by law. We may not actually achieve the plans, intentions or expectations disclosed in our forward-looking statements, and you should not place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements do not reflect the potential impact of any future acquisitions, mergers, dispositions, joint ventures or investments.

Mission
Our mission is to forge human connections between consumers and the brands they love through absolutely engaging experiences.
Overview
Braze is a leading customer engagement platform that empowers brands to Be Absolutely Engaging. Customer Engagement is an emerging category of business activity and software which we define as the full set of activities that companies use to build and maintain direct, meaningful relationships with their customers.
 
Our platform empowers brands to listen to their customers better, understand them more deeply, and act on that understanding in a way that is human and personal. As of January 2025, 2,296 customers around the world trusted Braze to power their cross-channel customer engagement strategies. In January 2025, our platform enabled interactions with 7.2 billion monthly active users via our customers’ apps, websites, and other digital interfaces, up from 6.2 billion in January 2024.
Over the last decade, as individuals and as consumers, our bond with technology has strengthened immensely. We have welcomed more and more digital services and products into our lives and integrated them into nearly every activity we take part in. Braze was founded in 2011 in response to the step change in human history ushered in by the "smartphone", where we began to become significantly more connected to each other and to the products and services that brands compete to sell to us. Today, consumers interact with many brands across a myriad of digital and physical touchpoints. The first-party data generated from digital experiences and the increased number of consumer touchpoints have provided brands with new opportunities to reach customers and personalize brand experiences, but it has also increased consumer expectations for highly relevant, personalized, and seamless cross-channel interactions. These trends have put competitive pressure on brands and led even traditional enterprises to increase their focus and investment on customer experience. Brands have evolved to create engagement opportunities with customers through the use of customer engagement software, increasing the use of first-party data and making those first-party relationships actionable in a way that helps differentiate them from their competition or transform their businesses, while forming lasting customer relationships that can increase brand loyalty and customer value over time. We view our own role as steward of a brand's first party relationships, achieved through the sophisticated management of their first-party data, as well as the orchestration and delivery of critical components of their marketing and product experience across an increasingly non-linear and digital customer journey.
Most cross-channel marketing automation platforms available today approach customer engagement on a channel-by-channel basis, which creates data and engagement silos that result in disjointed customer experiences and diminishes customer loyalty. We built Braze to facilitate the craft of customer engagement—a pursuit that is distinct from merely the activity of sending marketing messages. The craft of customer engagement brings together diverse skillsets, bold creativity, the sophisticated use of data, and an agile, experimental approach to the strategy that unlocks value in more of the moments that matter for customers as they move through their journey with a brand.
In addition to avoiding siloed channels and data, our platform empowers real-time engagement between brands and their customers. The real-time nature of the interactions we enable is crucial, and is made possible by our proprietary, enterprise-

grade stream processing architecture. This architecture receives, contextualizes, and responds to first-party customer data in the moment. We have designed it to listen like a human would, process new information in context, and react instantaneously, enabling marketers to run engagement campaigns and messaging that feel relevant and personal.
Braze also unleashes the power of interdisciplinary teams by serving numerous stakeholders beyond traditional marketers, including product and engineering teams, business intelligence, and data engineering teams. Our platform produces valuable data that informs decisions and actions across customer engagement strategies. Our engagement capabilities transcend marketing use cases, often being used for product or transactional use cases that facilitate or enhance the consumer’s experience with the brand or product. As a result, Braze is often a critical part of our customers’ communications infrastructure. 
Our platform is also designed to serve the needs of customers across sizes, stages of growth, industries, and geographies. Our customers include many established global enterprises and leading technology innovators. We employ a land-and-expand business model centered around offering products that are easy to adopt and have a rapid time to value. We expand our reach within existing customers when our customers add new channels, purchase additional subscription products, implement new engagement strategies, or onboard new business units and geographies. We also grow as our customers grow because our pricing is based in large part on the number of consumers that our customers reach and the volume of messages our customers send. 
A key aspect of Braze's differentiation is that we offer a platform, not a point solution, that gives brands an end-to-end solution for achieving their customer engagement goals, not just a tool to send messages. We vertically integrate our data activation, insights and segmentation, orchestration, personalization and relevance capabilities and also leverage artificial intelligence (“AI”) investments across each layer of the stack, so coordinating between them is simple and fast. Meanwhile, we abstract away the particulars of disparate data sources and the vagaries of the many messaging channels we support, so that when marketers implement their customer engagement strategies in Braze, they can maintain a customer-centric mindset – focused on the intersection of the goals of their brand with the needs of the consumer, not the complexity of data integrations or siloed message channels. This also provides consistency across Braze's insights and segmentation, orchestration, and relevance feature set, making it easier for our customers to expand across channels, and allowing our research and development investments into areas like predictive intelligence or Braze's Canvas visual development environment to deliver broad impact quickly and efficiently.
This product architecture supports differentiated use of AI and machine learning through its comprehensive access to first party-data, and an ability to directly take action to guide the customer journey. When deployed by our customers, our platform is typically leveraged across consumer touchpoints and sources of first-party data, including integration of the Braze software development kits, or SDKs, into end-user applications and websites, and the configuration of automated connections into customer data warehouses or data platforms via the Braze Data Platform. This enables more advanced experimentation and automated decision making and also creates the opportunity to personalize and optimize customer journeys at scale. With BrazeAI, marketers can improve outcomes for both consumers and brands by creating experiences with relevant content, journeys, and offers tailored to each individual. Our platform also has the promise to improve operational efficiency for the teams that use Braze – as we continue to expand our product surface area and enhance its capabilities by infusing AI, we can help brands create personalized, cross-channel solutions faster, and compound their learnings through automated experimentation and data analysis, ultimately increasing their return on investment over time.
Within the orchestration layer, we enable marketers to easily design, visualize, and launch customer journeys utilizing Canvas, our proprietary, no-code journey orchestration tool. With Canvas’s comprehensive journey testing, marketers can also test, implement, and optimize the most effective channels, cadence, messaging, or creative elements from a single tool. As the usability of Canvas has improved over time, more customer communication and engagement workloads have adopted it, which we believe cements Braze in our customers’ technology ecosystems. We have also developed, and continue to refine, an AI recommendation engine that utilizes a custom-trained transformer model to match items for Braze Catalogs with customers more likely to buy them, providing content personalization that can outperform competing techniques.
We support interactions across both in-product and out-of-product messaging channels. Today, our messaging channels consist of widely used digital channels such as email; mobile messaging such as SMS, MMS, and RCS messages, WhatsApp and LINE messaging, and webhooks; as well as in-product and web experiences such as in-app messages (including in-product messaging to apps on connected TV and gaming platforms), in-browser messages, surveys, mobile and web push notifications, Braze Content Cards – which are flexible, content-rich messages embedded in a mobile app or web browsers, Landing Pages – which are standalone web pages with a single call-to-action often used for audience acquisition and conversion, and Feature Flags – which allow our customers to remotely enable or disable mobile or web experiences for different audiences. Finally, Braze Audience Sync also unifies owned and paid channel strategies across platforms such as Meta, Google, TikTok, Pinterest, Snapchat, and Criteo. The flexibility of our platform also allows us to add new channels quickly and efficiently as they become relevant to our customers.

We enable brands to easily integrate our platform with both in-house technical infrastructure and our expanding partner ecosystem of best-in-class technologies. For instance, capabilities within the Braze Data Platform allow our customers to set up a direct connection between their data warehouses or platforms and Braze to automatically sync relevant user attributes, events, and purchases. Once synced to Braze, this data can be imported into any layer of our platform and can be leveraged for use cases such as personalization or segmentation. Customers can also use the Braze Data Platform to stream data in real time to those systems, which increases the return on our customers’ other technology investments. We support direct integrations with a range of providers, including cloud data service and warehouses, customer data platforms, analytics and reporting solutions, as well as other components of the modern marketing technology ecosystem such as eCommerce and Software-as-a-Service, or SaaS, applications.
Our Competitive Strengths
Cross-Channel Approach, Enabling Customer-Centric Experiences
Our cross-channel engagement approach enables customer-centric experiences. We build a more timely, contextual, and complete picture of the customer and draw real-time insights from data flow to inform strategy and drive execution. This fosters a more cohesive messaging and brand engagement experience across all channels, allowing brands to deploy the right communication and engagement messaging through channels based on a channel’s strengths and proven customer preferences.
Our architecture ensures that our capabilities can be used across all of our channels, maximizing the impact of new feature development. This is particularly valuable for the investments we have and will continue to make in artificial intelligence and machine learning features, such as predictive audience targeting, AI copywriting assistance, and automatic multivariate testing and optimization, which are designed to reduce the amount of manual time that marketers dedicate to building and executing customer engagement campaigns, thereby improving overall results without additional effort. Additionally, when we add new channels, they immediately benefit from all of the existing functionality that we have already built, which makes them fully featured and robust from the outset. This means that these new channels can compete against existing point solutions at launch and reach scale more quickly.
Because Braze offers a true end-to-end customer engagement platform, and not a point solution, marketers benefit from the applicability of features across all channels. Combined with our intuitive user interface, this allows our customers to quickly and easily construct cross-channel consumer journeys without the need to learn different skills for each channel, making it easier for them to grow with Braze over time. This is accomplished without sacrificing the unique qualities and capabilities associated with each individual channel that we support.
Data Streaming Architecture Processes First-Party Data in Real Time
The real-time nature of the interactions we enable is made possible by our proprietary, enterprise-grade stream processing architecture. This architecture receives, contextualizes and reacts to first-party customer data in the moment. Our platform allows for high-volume, continuous streaming of user data to be processed in real time, providing a live understanding of the many interactions that consumers are having with a brand. Unlike batch processing, where data is processed only when a specific time or threshold is hit, our data streaming architecture processes each unit of data as it is created. Real-time data processing enhances messaging relevance, in contrast to batch processing, where delayed data processing often leads to irrelevant messages and frustrated consumers.
We not only process data but also create analytical data. When a consumer interacts with any messaging channel that Braze delivers, or any of the brand’s digital products or services that have been integrated with an embedded Braze SDK, that consumer generates data that is processed and contextualized with existing user data models in real time. This allows marketers to better understand consumer behavior and associate specific content or messaging with in-product engagement, providing further context that can be leveraged for deeper engagement. 
Our stream processing architecture and access to first-party data also supports differentiated use of AI and machine learning, which can improve consumer outcomes and, in turn, increase the return on investment our platform provides to our customers.
Global, High Performance at Scale
As brands continue to grow, transform, and conduct more of their business digitally, they need a customer engagement platform that scales with them. In January 2025, our platform enabled interactions with 7.2 billion monthly active users via our customers’ apps, websites, and other digital interfaces, up from 6.2 billion in January 2024. Our scalability distinguishes our platform from point solutions, and we can handle the biggest of enterprise needs with highly reliable uptime. We facilitate the rapid delivery of a high volume of messages, which enables us to power a brand’s highest-volume events, whether they are expected, like Black Friday, or unexpected events or scenarios.

The depth and breadth of our business footprint around the world offers always-on support and local market expertise, which we view as a differentiator as organizations become more global. Braze has customers in over 70 countries and an operational presence across North America, Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. Braze also has local data centers in the United States, Europe and the Asia-Pacific region.
Rapid Time to Value Across the Organization
While for many brands the marketing organization has traditionally owned the responsibility for customer engagement, cross-functional collaboration enhances the experience for the customer and improves the return on investment for the marketing organization. For brands that take a collaborative approach, marketing teams work hand-in-hand with data, product and engineering teams to optimize customer engagement. For example, our Feature Flags product is designed to support product and growth teams to easily deliver personalized experiences allowing brands to launch features faster, tailor functionality to different audiences, and coordinate feature releases with cross-channel messages.
Our platform’s ease of use and seamless integration into existing technologies, coupled with the high value data and insights that it generates, enables brands to develop and run campaigns that meet their strategic goals quickly and efficiently. Using our intuitive user interface and drag-and-drop tools like Canvas, individuals across all roles and technical skill levels can design and quickly deploy multi-message, cross-channel, A/B- and multivariate-tested strategies, with the process of new campaign creation accelerating over time.
Braze gives teams across a company the power to imagine, create, and evolve brilliant customer experiences. When designing campaigns, marketers use our composition tools to bring new creative ideas to life across all appropriate channels and platforms. They can also leverage the strategic and creative insights of our Customer Success and Strategic Consulting teams, or find inspiration through engaging with our Braze Bonfire customer community as they brainstorm new approaches. When it comes time for execution, marketers and product engineers use Braze to orchestrate personalized experiences and directly embed them into their products. Finally, data scientists and business intelligence teams analyze data gained from marketing and lifecycle campaigns, creating a rapid experimentation loop that compounds improvements and gains over time, and helps inspire new creative ideas. We serve as the unifying thread that enables brands to draw on the strength of multiple teams working in concert to bring creative, technical and business intelligence skills together.
Seamless, Real-Time Interoperability across the Customer Engagement Technology Stack
Our open APIs support easy-to-implement integrations with an expanding selection of in-house systems, third-party technology providers, global systems integrators, and our formal technology partners, which we refer to as Braze Alloys. These integrations and partnerships allow customers to easily expand to messaging channels Braze may not offer native support for, easily import and export data to and from a wide variety of sources, or provide specialized services that speed integration and time to value.
Our seamless integrations with technology partners not only enrich the consumer insights collected by our platform, but also increase the return on other technology investments by allowing other systems and tools to benefit from or add to the data and insights collected by our platform. For instance, with Braze Cloud Data Ingestion, our customers can set up a direct connection between their data warehouses or platforms and Braze to automatically sync relevant user attributes, events, and purchases. Once synced to Braze through Cloud Data Ingestion, this data can be imported into any layer of our platform and can be leveraged for a number use cases. Customers can also use Braze Currents to stream data in real time back into those systems, which increases the return on our customers’ other technology investments.
For example, a food delivery app may combine a consumer’s food preferences with weather data to either send a campaign to encourage a consumer to order-in their favorite foods when a blizzard is forecasted or skip the “order-in tonight” discount on days when the weather is sunny. A retailer might reach out to a consumer when a favorite article of clothing goes on sale after confirming with their inventory management technology that the particular article of clothing is in stock in the consumer’s size and color preference. These and other integrations provide an opportunity for our customers to further build the personalized brand relationships that consumers desire.

Marketers, Braze Certified Digital Strategists, or Braze Certified Developers. Braze Bonfire, our virtual, global customer community, includes thousands of individuals across a wide spectrum of industries, business sizes, and roles. Thousands of community members use Braze Bonfire to exchange growth marketing and lifecycle marketing best practices, to give direct feedback to our product and engineering teams and to attend events, engage in professional networking, and explore career growth opportunities.
Growth Strategy
The principal components of our growth strategy are:
•
Acquire new customers:
 We intend to continue to expand our customer base in verticals where we already have a strong presence — such as retail and consumer goods, media and entertainment, telecommunications, restaurants and on-demand services, healthcare and life sciences, technology, manufacturing, education, government and public services, and financial services — and to increase our presence in verticals where we are not yet strongly represented. Through our sales and marketing efforts, we also plan to capitalize on industries and verticals subject to ongoing digital transformation and where direct-to-consumer relationships are accelerating to further propel adoption of our technology.
•
Expand within our existing customer base: 
We believe we can achieve significant growth by expanding sales within our existing customer base. We expand the use of our platform with existing customers by, among others, adding new channels and increasing the messaging volume we sell to our customers as their businesses and needs continue to grow and as they connect directly with additional consumers, which in turn leads to a need for greater messaging capacity. The addition of new channels that benefit from our orchestration engine and real-time streaming platform may also further differentiate our product, helping to sustain or increase win-rates. We also anticipate that as more customers reach higher levels of digital sophistication, they will invest in additional data streaming and data management capabilities. We see an opportunity within our customers’ organizations to create new use cases for our platform as they broaden the use of our platform beyond the traditional marketing team, as marketers become more technically savvy, as technologists work more closely with marketing teams, and as data scientists become more influential within their organizations. Given that many of our customers are multinational conglomerates, we also see the opportunity to further penetrate our existing customer base by expanding to new brands and new geographies within those existing customer organizations.
•
Expand geographically:
 We believe there is a significant opportunity to continue to expand usage of our platform outside the United States, both by expanding our presence in international markets where we operate today and by entering markets we have not yet penetrated. For instance, we have operational footprints across North America, South America, Europe, the Asia-Pacific region, and the Middle East. We expect to continue increasing our market penetration in these regions, while further capitalizing on the greenfield opportunities in regions such as Latin America. 
•
Expand our technology leadership through continued investment and new products: 
We are focused on investing in research and development to continue to enhance our platform. For example, we continue to develop our artificial intelligence capabilities to enable brands to better analyze and act on customer data. We believe our market-driven product development approach maximizes the return on new feature development and channel expansion. Our customers consistently volunteer to participate in the testing of new products, which indicates their appetite for new and innovative functionality. We believe our continued innovation will provide new avenues for growth through which we will continue to deliver differentiated outcomes for our customers.
•
Continue to increase and strengthen our partnerships: 
We have built and plan to continue investing in direct integrations with technology partners that augment our core offering with a broad range of complementary offerings, including data augmentation and enrichment, analytics, and channel extensions. We have also invested in, and continued to expand, our relationships with the ecosystem of solution partners, marketing agencies, consultancies, and global system integrators that offer opportunities for new customer referrals.
Our Products
We offer a single, vertically integrated platform that encompasses the major functionalities, or layers, required for modern customer engagement: data activation, insights and segmentation, orchestration, relevance, and cross-channel action, all of which is supported by BrazeAI, our AI engine designed to power AI functionality across all layers of this technology stack.

Table 
of Contents
Braze delivers a range of BrazeAI features across all layers of its vertically-integrated technology stack to enable brands to create, personalize and optimize their customer engagement efforts. Specific features that leverage BrazeAI are noted below within the applicable layer of the technology stack.
Data Activation
The Braze Data Platform is a comprehensive, composable set of Braze capabilities and partner integrations designed to help marketers leverage data to deliver more impactful, scalable customer experiences powered by Braze. This includes features such as:
•
Braze SDKs
: The primary way in which customers integrate our platform into their websites and applications is via our SDKs. SDKs are software libraries that reside within our customers’ applications or websites, automatically managing data ingestion and the delivery of mobile and web notifications, in-application / in-browser interstitial messages, and Braze Content Cards. Our SDKs can be integrated into a wide variety of digital interfaces including iOS, Android, Desktop / Mobile Web, connected TVs, the Unity and Unreal game engines, and application development frameworks such as React Native and Cordova. By embedding new messaging capabilities directly in our SDKs, we can rapidly deploy new functionality to our customers, with little to no additional effort on their part.
•
REST API
: The majority of our customers also integrate via connecting to server-to-server APIs. The Braze REST API can be used to import or export data or to trigger workflows between Braze and brands’ existing technology stacks. For example, customers can send messages using Braze within internal business processes or connect Braze to third-party services such as customer data platforms or attribution providers.
•
Partner Data Integrations:
 Brands can sync user cohorts from partners such as Amplitude, Tealium, or Mixpanel to our platform. They can then use membership in these user cohorts as additional criteria in the Braze Classification layer. Retail brands can also sync e-commerce data directly from Shopify, configurable via a simple web interface.
•
Data Transformation:
 Brands can programmatically sync and transform user data from SaaS tools or platforms that can send webhooks. Once synced to our platform, this data can be used just like any other data in the Braze platform.
•
Braze Cloud Data Ingestion:
 Braze Cloud Data Ingestion is a key example of composability within the Braze Data Platform. By offering direct connections to all major cloud services and data warehouses, Marketing, Product and Growth teams can access their customer and product data directly from the source – for audience construction, segmentation, message triggering and personalization. Cloud Data Ingestion removes the need to maintain complex data pipelines and empowers brands with direct data access, without ongoing reliance on technical teams.
Insights and Segmentation
•
Segmentation:
 Customers can define reusable segments of consumers based upon data such as, but not limited to, attributes, events, user behaviors, product catalog metadata, or predictive propensity scores from our machine learning algorithms. Braze Segments are updated in real-time as data is ingested, allowing them to stay up-to-date with the latest data inputs.
•
Segment Insights:
 Segment Insights allows customers to analyze how segments are performing relative to each other across a set of pre-selected key performance indicators. Additionally, customers can use this tool to understand the factors that determine which consumers belong to a particular segment.
•
BrazeAI
 
Predictive Suite:
 BrazeAI Predictive Suite allows customers to identify groups of consumers that are of critical business value such as “consumers who are likely to churn.” Our platform uses machine learning to automatically identify consumers who have a propensity to behave similarly to the identified audience, allowing customers to preemptively engage these consumers and thereby encourage or discourage their predicted behaviors.
Orchestration
•
Canvas: 
Canvas is our flagship orchestration tool, allowing customers to create journeys, mapping out multi-step, cross-channel messaging experiences such as onboarding flows, nurture campaigns, win-back strategies, and more. Canvases are designed to be flexible and real-time, able to execute nearly any digital marketing campaign strategy that customers can envision. Canvas is natively cross-channel and customers use it to design and execute strategies that span all of the platforms and channels that our platform supports. Using Canvas, customers can create multiple variants of a journey and automatically optimize customer journeys based on the performance of the variants.

of Contents
•
Campaigns:
 Campaigns allow customers to send one set of single-channel or multi-channel messages to be delivered to customers in a particular user segment. Campaigns can be one-time or recurring sends that are delivered on a time-based schedule, or can be sent in response to a user’s actions, or triggered by an API call. Campaigns support all of Braze’s messaging channels and offer experimentation such as A/B testing.
•
Event and API Triggering: 
Messages, steps within a Canvas, or entire Canvas flows can be triggered in a variety of ways, such as when events of a certain type are received or when API calls are initiated from our customers’ servers.
•
Marketing Pressure Management: 
Customers can create sophisticated and targeted campaigns designed to appropriately target the individual consumer. Customers can use our platform to automatically run a multi-armed bandit optimization, and to send each user the campaign variant they are most likely to engage based on A/B testing. Once the appropriate campaign has been identified, our customers can then limit the number of messages sent from the platform by capping the frequency of message type (e.g., no more than three push notifications per week or no more than one promotional email per day), or by limiting the speed at which our platform sends messages (e.g., no more than 10,000 messages per minute).
•
Reporting and Analytics:
 We provide a variety of analytics features to help our customers understand and improve their customer engagement strategies:
◦
Campaign and Canvas Analytics:
 Our platform provides analytics breakdowns for all Campaigns and Canvases, including tracking conversion rates. Customers can create multiple variants and results can be compared statistically against one another or a control.
◦
Funnel and Retention Reports:
 Customers can analyze the retention uplift caused by a messaging strategy, or create and analyze funnels of actions that were taken by consumers after receiving a message.
◦
BrazeAI
 
Predictive Suite:
 The Braze Predictive Suite enables brands to use machine learning to determine what customers are likely to purchase and/or churn without any engineering resources. Predictive Churn and Predictive Purchases are customizable, on-demand predictive models brands can create in minutes to effectively leverage and act on data seamlessly within the Braze platform.
◦
Report Builder: 
Customers can create custom reports to analyze the total uplift and aggregate statistics from their usage of our platform.
◦
Dashboards:
 Braze enables customers to aggregate and further analyze engagement, conversion, deliverability, and other key performance metrics using pre-built, customizable dashboards.
◦
Query Builder and BrazeAI Query Builder:
 Customers can generate highly-customized reports using a SQL editor or pre-built template. The BrazeAI Query Builder makes it easy for marketers to generate SQL from natural language prompting and receive sample SQL query suggestions.
◦
Global Holdout Groups:
 To allow customers to isolate the impact of their marketing efforts, customers can create global holdout groups, consisting of consumers who should only receive a subset of critical communications from the customer (e.g., password reset emails) and otherwise be held out from all communication. Lifetime value of this holdout group can be easily compared against that of consumers who received the full suite of Braze engagement.
Relevance
•
Liquid Templating and BrazeAI Liquid Assistant:
 Customers can personalize messages using the Liquid Templating language to inject personalized content into their messages. Our platform allows customers to flexibly utilize a wide variety of data in this templating process, including data ingested and stored on consumer profiles, from Catalogs, as well as contextual data, such as properties of a consumer action that triggered a message flow. Personalization options include use cases such as listing a set of consumer-specific recommendations or creating sophisticated if/else logic inside of a message to conditionally determine what content to deliver. The BrazeAI Liquid Assistant makes it easy for marketers to generate Liquid from templates, receive personalized Liquid suggestions, and optimize existing Liquid using natural language prompting. The assistant also provides annotations explaining the Liquid used, so marketers can further develop their skills and understanding of Liquid.
•
Connected Content: 
Customers can connect to remote servers (including both third-party partners and first-party customer-owned endpoints) and pull back data for advanced personalization use cases. For example, customers can 
10
Table 
of Contents
personalize messages on a one-to-one basis by connecting to a recommendation engine or modify messages to a user based upon the current weather at the user’s location.
•
Content Management: 
Customers can upload, store and reuse various types of content across messages. Braze offers both pre-built and customer-generated templates, a media asset library, a preference center builder and Content Blocks. Content Blocks enable customers to create reusable, cross-channel content (including Liquid Templating content). Templates, Content Blocks and a customer’s preference center can also be updated and managed via API, extending their functionality and connecting them to customer data sources dynamically. Customers can also utilize our generative AI functions to support the development of new content or images, and use our approval workflows to provide additional oversight of how and when content is used in campaigns.
◦
BrazeAI Content Generation and Quality Assurance:
▪
AI Copywriting Assistant
: The BrazeAI copywriting assistant enables customers to generate relevant copy that references their brand personality and guidelines. Customers can generate marketing copy directly in message composers in the Braze dashboard, offering inspiration for new approaches to copy or helping to scale personalized, on-brand copy across customer experiences.
▪
AI Image Generator
: Customers can generate images for their media library using BrazeAI. This system can create realistic images and art from a description in natural language.
▪
AI Content QA
: Content QA using BrazeAI performs checks on the content of a message, confirming that it adheres to quality standards by identifying ineffective elements such as spelling errors, grammar issues, inappropriate tone, and offensive language.
•
Intelligent Timing and Channel: 
Our platform will automatically calculate when consumers are most likely to engage with a particular messaging channel, and can send messages to consumers at the time that is optimal for them based upon their behavior patterns for a particular channel.
•
Personalized Variant:
 Our platform can send each user the campaign variant they are most likely to engage with based on an analysis of how users with similar profiles responded to each variant in an initial A/B test.
•
BrazeAI Item Recommendations:
 Customers can calculate what is likely to be the most popular item or product or create personalized AI recommendations from a specific catalog which can then be inserted into messages.
•
Catalogs:
 Customers can store relational or tabular data with Braze that can be used for segmentation, event triggering, and message personalization. Data stored in Braze Catalogs can be synced automatically from customer data warehouses using Braze Cloud Data Ingestion, and Catalogs natively supports triggered notifications such as "back-in-stock" journeys that can trigger when an item in a Catalog is replenished and back in stock. For example, Catalog data can be combined with our Braze segmentation to identify high-value cohorts of customers, such as users who recently viewed products that are now discounted. Catalogs can also be used for basic product recommendation use cases.
Cross-Channel Action
•
In-Product Messaging and Experimentation:
◦
In-App and In-Browser Messages:
 Our platform offers a variety of interstitial messages that can be added to mobile applications and web browsers for engagement use cases – ranging from reminders, confirmation dialogs, promotions, surveys, and more. These in-experience messages can be built from templates using our drag and drop editor or built from scratch with nearly infinite customizability.
◦
Braze 
Content Cards:
 In addition to ephemeral messages, we offer Braze Content Cards, a proprietary product where a personalized feed of user-controllable content is embedded directly into applications and browsers for persistent viewing.
◦
Feature Flags:
 Feature flags allow customers to remotely enable or disable mobile app or web functionality for a selection of users. Customers can turn a feature on and off in production without additional code deployment or app store updates. This allows customers to safely roll out new features with confidence and coordinate roll-outs with messaging across the full set of channels supported by our platform.

◦
Landing Pages
: Landing Pages are standalone webpages that customers can use to drive user acquisition and engagement. Customers can use our native Landing Page builder to create and launch custom landing pages in a drag and drop editor. This allows customers to capture new leads or, if used throughout the customer lifecycle, to drive conversions on upsells, loyalty programs, content downloads, referrals, and more. 
•
Out-of-Product Messaging:
◦
Push Notifications: 
Our platform provides robust push notification messaging capabilities across both mobile and web. In addition to supporting push notifications on all major platforms, we have released advanced functionality such as Push Stories (paginated image carousels within notifications) and iOS Live Activities (persistent, interactive notifications displayed directly on users’ lock screens), to increase the power and flexibility of the channel.
◦
Email: 
Our platform provides a full suite of email engagement technology, including email template editing and management with a drag and drop editor, link tracking and heatmap analytics, email preference centers, and seed lists. We also support advanced email content types, such as Accelerated Mobile Pages, which enables marketers to embed interactive elements.
◦
SMS, MMS, and RCS:
 Our platform offers a native product for SMS, MMS, and RCS messaging. In addition to sending messages via the SMS, MMS, and RCS protocols, customers can manage links and analytics and respond to inbound keyword responses with an automated follow-up message.
◦
Ad Network Integrations:
 Using Braze Audience Sync with Meta, Google, TikTok, Snapchat, Pinterest, or Criteo, brands can sync first-party data from Braze to each respective advertising platform to deliver more relevant advertisements outside the Braze platform based upon behavioral triggers, segmentation and more.
◦
WhatsApp Integration:
 Our platform is directly integrated with the WhatsApp Cloud API, making it easy to natively compose and orchestrate two-way messages as part of cross-channel campaigns in Braze.
◦
LINE Integration
: Our platform is also integrated with LINE. Brands can leverage zero- and first-party data to compose and orchestrate relevant LINE messages as a part of any cross-channel campaign in Braze.
•
Webhooks: 
Our platform offers flexible webhooks, allowing customers to connect Braze to any external application via outbound web requests, using all of the targeting and templating mechanisms available on other channels. Customers can use webhooks for utility purposes (such as messaging to their own servers) as well as to build integrations with other third-party partner systems, such as to direct email providers, extending the range and utility of our platform.
•
Transactional Messaging: 
We offer an optional premium service with even higher speed and reliability guarantees for critical use cases.
•
Braze Currents:
 All data sent to and generated by our platform can be continuously exported to a range of partner systems. These systems include data storage partners such as Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services, and Google Cloud; Customer Data Platforms such as Segment, mParticle and Tealium; and analytics providers such as Amplitude and Mixpanel. Braze Currents can also export data to generic web endpoints for maximum flexibility. Customers can use these integrations to leverage their Braze data elsewhere within their technology ecosystem, thereby enabling tighter collaboration between marketing/growth teams and their partners in business intelligence or engineering.
•
Snowflake Data Sharing: 
Alongside Braze Currents, data tracked and stored within our platform can also be accessed directly via our partnership with Snowflake using Snowflake’s Data Sharing mechanism.
In addition, we provide several features for general management of our platform designed to allow customers of all
sizes to maximize their efficiency:
•
Operations and Administration: 
We provide audit logs for major actions that occur in our platform, change logs for updates to objects such as Campaigns, Segments, or Canvases on our dashboard, and permissions, commenting, versioning and approval flow capabilities in various parts of the product. Furthermore, we offer, and plan to expand on, debugging capabilities in the platform that allow customers to better troubleshoot their integrations and messaging strategies.
•
Access Controls and Security:
 We provide a complete set of Role-Based Access Controls to allow large global teams to manage our platform effectively. In addition to these Role-Based Access Control mechanisms, we offer Braze 
12
Table 
of Contents
Teams, which allows customers to break their consumer base into segments based on the consumer’s country, language, or a custom attribute. With Braze Teams, customers can create groups to manage individual regions or subsets of their businesses while restricting the ability of specified users to view or manage data outside of their assigned region. We also integrate with a variety of identity providers for single-sign-on or user account provisioning and provide configurable security controls such as session timeouts, password complexity, two-factor authentication, and IP allow lists. 
Our Competition
The market for customer engagement solutions is evolving and highly competitive. There are several established and emerging competitors that address specific aspects of customer engagement, but we believe that none of our competitors currently offer comparable comprehensive customer engagement solutions. We face competition from software companies that offer marketing solutions, such as legacy marketing clouds like Adobe and Salesforce, and point solutions like Airship, Iterable, Klaviyo, CleverTap and MoEngage.
Many of our existing competitors have, and our potential competitors could have, substantial competitive advantages, such as greater name recognition, longer operating histories, larger sales and marketing budgets and resources, greater customer support resources, lower labor and development costs, larger and more mature intellectual property portfolios and substantially greater financial, technical and other resources than we do. In addition, our competitors may have an advantage in markets where our policies regarding the use of customer data are more restrictive than local laws, regulations, policies and standards. For example, competitors willing to sell customer data in markets where such activity is permissible may have a pricing advantage over us in such markets. Additionally, to the extent there is a sustained general economic downturn, our customers and potential customers may experience delays and reductions in general customer engagement technology spending. As a result, our competitors may respond to market conditions by lowering prices or making other contractual concessions in an attempt to lure away our current and potential customers. With the introduction of new technologies and the entry of new competitors into the market, we expect competition to persist and intensify in the future. Recently, there has also been significant merger and acquisition activity in the technology industry, including among our competitors. These consolidation trends could increase the likelihood that we compete with other large technology companies. This could harm our ability to increase sales, maintain or increase subscription renewals, and maintain our prices.
Conditions in our market could change rapidly and significantly as a result of advancements in AI and other technologies, partnering among our competitors or continuing market consolidation. Some of our larger competitors also have substantially broader product lines and market focus and therefore may not be as susceptible to downturns in a particular market. New start-up companies that innovate, and large companies that are making significant investments in research and development, may invent similar or superior products and technologies that compete with one or more of our platform offerings. In addition, some of our competitors may enter into new alliances with each other or may establish or strengthen cooperative relationships with agency partners, technology and application providers in complementary categories, or other parties. Competitors may also consolidate with existing partners that we rely on, and as a result we could lose such partnerships. Any such consolidation, acquisition, alliance or cooperative relationship could lead to pricing pressure, a loss of market share or a smaller addressable share of the market and could result in a competitor with greater financial, technical, marketing, service and other resources, all of which could harm our ability to compete.
Some of our larger competitors use their broader product offerings to compete with us, bundling their competitive products with other products being purchased from that company by a customer or closing access to their technology platform, thereby making it more difficult for customers to integrate. Potential customers may prefer to purchase from their existing suppliers rather than a new supplier, regardless of product performance or features. Furthermore, potential customers may be more willing to incrementally add solutions to their existing infrastructure from competitors than to replace their existing infrastructure with our platform and offerings. These competitive pressures in our market, or our failure to compete effectively, may result in price reductions, fewer sales, reduced revenue and gross margins, increased net losses and loss of, or failure to expand, our market share.
Sales and Marketing
We sell subscriptions to our platform primarily through a direct sales force with primary operations in North America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region. Our team of account executives is responsible for selling to new customers as well as existing customers who may renew their subscriptions, increase the usage of our platform over time and expand the deployment of our platform across their organizations. In addition, we sell our platform through our joint venture in Japan, as well as through resellers in South Korea and Latin America.
Our marketing activities are designed to build broad brand awareness, generate thought leadership and create demand and leads for our sales organizations within our target markets. Our marketing programs target influencers and decision makers participating in the buying cycle, including the Chief Digital Officer, Chief Marketing Officer, Chief Product Officer, Chief 
13
Table 
of Contents
Technology Officer, and other key functional marketing and technology heads. Additionally, we conduct marketing programs to engage with our customers to promote upsell and cross-sell opportunities, and we engage with industry analysts, consulting firms, marketing service providers, data and technology partners, marketing agencies and other platform partners, business and trade press and other industry experts who exert considerable influence in our market.
Intellectual Property
Intellectual property rights are important to the success of our business. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as license agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements with third parties, and other contractual protections, to protect our intellectual property rights, including our proprietary technology, software, know-how and brand. However, we also use open source software in our services.
As of January 31, 2025, we owned 26 patents and had four patent applications pending for examination in the United States and no non-U.S. patents or patent applications. The pending U.S. patent applications, if issued, would be scheduled to expire at various times between 2043 and 2044. As of January 31, 2025, we owned six registered trademarks in the United States and 48 registered trademarks in various non-U.S. jurisdictions.
Although we rely on intellectual property rights, including patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, as well as contractual protections to establish and protect our proprietary rights, we believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, creation of new services, features and functionality, and frequent enhancements to our platform are more essential to establishing and maintaining our technology leadership position.
We control access to and use of our proprietary technology and other confidential information through the use of internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, contractors, customers and partners. We require our employees, consultants and other third parties to enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements, and we control and monitor access to our software, documentation, proprietary technology and other confidential information. Our policy is to require all employees and independent contractors to sign agreements assigning to us any inventions, trade secrets, works of authorship, developments, processes and other intellectual property generated by them on our behalf and under which they agree to protect our confidential information. In addition, we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our customers and partners. See the section titled “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Intellectual Property” for a more comprehensive description of risks related to our intellectual property.
Seasonality
We experience seasonality in our cost of revenue as a result of our customers’ increased usage of our platform based on their business demands. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Seasonality” for additional information.
Privacy, Data Security and Data Protection
In the ordinary course of our business, we may process personal data. We are, or may become, subject to a number of privacy, data security and data protection obligations, including federal, state and foreign laws and regulations that involve matters central to our business. These laws and regulations may involve privacy, data security, data protection, rights of publicity, content regulation, intellectual property, competition, consumer protection or other subjects. Such obligations may include, without limitation, the Federal Trade Commission Act, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography And Marketing Act, the California Consumer Privacy Act (as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act), or the CCPA, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation, or the EU GDPR, the EU GDPR’s equivalent in the United Kingdom, or the U.K. GDPR, the ePrivacy Directive, Canada’s Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act and various related provincial laws, and Canada’s Anti-Spam Legislation. In addition, numerous other states within the United States have also enacted, or are in the process of enacting or considering, comprehensive data privacy laws that share similarities with the CCPA.
The increasingly stringent and evolving regulatory frameworks related to personal data processing may increase our compliance obligations and exposure for any noncompliance. For example, the CCPA imposes obligations on covered businesses to provide specific disclosures related to a business’ collection and use of personal data and to respond to certain requests from California residents related to their personal data, including requests to receive information on the business’s personal data processing activities, to delete the individual’s personal data, and to opt out of certain sharing and sales of personal data. The CCPA also provides for civil penalties and a private right of action for violations which may include an award of statutory damages. Moreover, laws in all 50 U.S. states require businesses to provide notice under certain circumstances to consumers whose personal data has been disclosed as a result of a data breach. Further, U.S. federal and state 
14
Table 
of Contents
consumer protection laws may require us to publish statements that accurately and fairly describe how we handle personal data and rights individuals may have about the way we handle their personal data. 
European data privacy and security laws (including the EU GDPR and U.K. GDPR) impose significant and complex compliance obligations regarding the collection, control, use, sharing, disclosure and other processing of personal data on entities that are subject to those laws. For example, the EU GDPR applies to any company established in the European Economic Area, or the EEA, and to companies established outside the EEA that process personal data in connection with the offering of goods or services to data subjects in the EEA or the monitoring of the behavior of data subjects in the EEA.
For additional information about the laws and regulations to which we are or may become subject and about the risks to our business associated with such laws and regulations, please see the section titled “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Privacy, Data Security and Data Protection Laws.”

Accordingly, these core values represent not only the ideals of our business, but the guiding tenets of how we operate every day, including how we communicate, how we make decisions, and how we treat our customers and our colleagues.
Social Impact
We established our Social Impact Department in 2021. Our social impact efforts include the Braze for Impact Fund, corporate social responsibility, programs supporting a global and inclusive culture, and sustainability and environmental, social, and governance, or ESG, reporting. These initiatives are designed with the intention of fostering a culture of advocacy that drives material, employee-led impact.
In 2021, we became a member of the Pledge 1% movement, through which we have reserved up to 964,647 shares of our Class A common stock, which we may continue to donate to the Braze for Impact donor advised fund, or DAF, through 2031, to fund our social impact initiatives.
The Braze Cares and Tech for an Equitable Future programs comprise our corporate social responsibility initiatives. Braze Cares is our employee donation and volunteering program. Tech for an Equitable Future is our product grant program for underrepresented founders, which offers 12 months of free access to Braze technology and supporting resources that enable business growth and scalability for qualifying companies.
Braze supports a global and inclusive culture focused on creating a sense of belonging in the Braze community that empowers each individual to contribute to our culture and our success. At its foundation, the company aims to grow and nurture 
15

an inclusive environment where each person uses their skills, talents, backgrounds and perspectives to contribute to the business success at Braze. We do this through making our processes and systems inclusive by design, monitoring the efficacy of our processes and systems, and delivering programs that enhance the Braze community.
Lastly, we maintain an ESG reporting function. Our sustainability function includes an annual greenhouse gas emissions audit, emission reductions programs, our climate commitments, and ESG disclosures. We also publish an annual ESG report.

Item 1A. Risk Factors
Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and our consolidated financial statements and related notes. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risk and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we presently deem less significant may also impair our business operations. If any of the events or circumstances described in the following risk factors is realized, our business, operating results, financial condition, cash flows, and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the market price of our Class A common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment.
Risk Factors Summary
Our business operations are subject to numerous risks, factors and uncertainties, including those outside of our control, that could cause our actual results to be harmed, including risks regarding the following:
•
Unstable market and economic conditions may have serious adverse consequences on our business, financial condition, and share price.
•
Our rapid revenue growth may not be indicative of our future revenue growth. Our rapid revenue growth also makes it difficult to evaluate our future prospects and may increase the risk that we will not be successful.
•
We may require additional capital to support business growth, and this capital might not be available on acceptable terms, if at all.
•
We have a limited history operating at our current scale, and our future results of operations may fluctuate significantly due to a wide range of factors, which make it difficult to forecast our future results of operations.

•
We have a history of operating losses and may not achieve or sustain profitability in the future.
•
The estimates of market opportunity and forecasts of market growth may prove to be inaccurate. Even if the market in which we compete achieves the forecasted growth, our business could fail to grow at similar rates, if at all.
•
We face intense competition, including from well-established companies that offer products that compete with ours.
•
We may lack sufficient financial or other resources to maintain or improve our competitive position, which may harm our ability to add new customers, retain existing customers, and grow our business.
•
If we are unable to attract new customers and renew existing customers, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected.
•
If we fail to adapt and respond effectively to rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, or changing regulations, or to changing customer or consumer needs, requirements or preferences, our platform may become less competitive.
•
We are substantially dependent upon customers renewing their subscriptions to, and expanding their use of, our platform to maintain and grow our revenue, which requires us to scale our platform infrastructure and business quickly enough to meet our customers’ growing needs. If we are not able to grow in an efficient manner, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed.
•
Failure to effectively develop our sales and marketing capabilities could harm our ability to expand our customer base and achieve broader market adoption of our platform and products.
•
We are dependent on a single platform, and the failure to achieve continued market acceptance of our platform could cause our results of operations to suffer.
•
If our platform fails to perform properly or there are defects or disruptions in the rollout of our platform updates or enhancements, our reputation could be adversely affected, our market share could decline, and we could be subject to liability claims.
•
We may need to reduce prices or change our pricing model to remain competitive.
•
Our business depends on our ability to send consumer engagement messages over a number of different channels and any significant disruption in service with our third-party providers or on mobile operating systems could result in a loss of customers or less effective consumer-brand engagement, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
•
We rely upon third-party providers of cloud-based infrastructure, including Amazon Web Services and Rackspace, to host our products. Any disruption in the operations of these third-party providers or limitations on capacity or interference with our use could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
•
We are subject to stringent and changing laws and regulations, industry standards and contractual obligations related to privacy, data security and data protection. The restrictions and costs imposed by these requirements and our actual or perceived failure to comply with them, could harm our business.
•
If we or our third-party service providers or vendors experience a security breach or unauthorized parties otherwise obtain access to our customers’ data, our data or our platform, our solution may be perceived as not being secure, our reputation may be harmed, demand for our platform and products may be reduced and we may incur significant liabilities.
•
Changes in laws and regulations related to the internet or changes in the internet infrastructure itself may diminish the demand for our platform and could have a negative impact on our business.
•
We employ third-party licensed software for use in or with our platform, and the inability to maintain these licenses or errors or vulnerabilities in the software we license could result in increased costs, or reduced service levels, which would adversely affect our business.
•
We have identified one material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, and if we are unable to achieve and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting may be adversely affected.
•
The dual class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting control with our executive officers, directors and significant holders of our capital stock, which limits the ability of holders of our Class A common stock to influence the outcome of important transactions.
Risks Related to Our Growth and Capital Requirements
Unstable market and economic conditions may have serious adverse consequences on our business, financial condition and share price.
The global economy, including credit and financial markets, has experienced extreme volatility and disruptions, including severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, increases in unemployment rates, increases in inflation rates, higher interest rates and uncertainty about economic stability. These unfavorable conditions have been, and may continue to be, exacerbated in the United States and abroad by global and domestic socioeconomic conditions, including the failure of high-profile banking and other financial institutions, the Federal Reserve’s attempts to combat inflation through interest rate increases, unrest in international trade relations, domestic and foreign political turmoil, natural catastrophes, pandemics related to highly infectious diseases, warfare and terrorist attacks on the United States, Europe, the Asia Pacific region or elsewhere, and international military conflicts and the related political and

economic responses. Continued volatility and disruptions may have adverse consequences on us or the third parties on whom we rely. If the financial, equity or credit markets further deteriorate, including as a result of the measures taken to combat inflation, volatility in the banking and financial services sector, political unrest or war, it may make any necessary debt or equity financing more difficult to obtain in a timely manner or on favorable terms, more costly or more dilutive. Increased inflation rates can adversely affect us by increasing our costs, including labor and employee benefits costs. In addition, higher inflation and macroeconomic turmoil and uncertainty could also adversely affect our customers, which could reduce demand for our products and services. For instance, we were founded in 2011, but our business and revenue have grown rapidly over the last several years. As a result of our limited history operating at our current scale, our ability to accurately forecast our future results of operations is limited and subject to a number of uncertainties, including our ability to plan for and model future growth, particularly in a volatile economic environment. Recent increases in inflation, economic volatility and related increases in interest rates have affected customer spending behavior. Significant continued increases in inflation, continued economic volatility and related increases in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. To the extent there is a sustained general economic downturn and our customer engagement platform is perceived by customers and potential customers as too costly, or too difficult to deploy or migrate to, our revenue may be disproportionately affected by delays or reductions in general customer engagement technology spending. This perception has previously, and may continue to, result in an extension of our sales cycle with potential customers, thus increasing the time and cost associated with our sales process. Further, even if our customers choose to use our platform, they may nonetheless reduce their customer engagement technology spending and elect not to purchase additional products and services in the future due to budget limitations. Additionally, our dollar-based net retention rate is influenced by macroeconomic factors that impact our customers’ purchasing decisions, who may choose to renew their contracts at levels more closely aligned with their current needs, rather than opting for larger commitments based on anticipated future demand. Macroeconomic factors may also impact our collection efforts for customer payments. If we experience collection pressure it may lengthen the time to collect on accounts receivable and increase in our bad debt expense, either of which could negatively impact our free cash flow. Also, competitors may respond to market conditions by lowering prices and attempting to lure away our current and potential customers. In addition, macroeconomic uncertainty may result in an increased pace of consolidation in certain industries in which our customers operate. If this were to occur it may result in reduced overall spending on our services, particularly if our customers are acquired by organizations that do not use our services. We cannot predict the timing, strength or duration of any economic slowdown, instability or recovery, generally or within any particular industry. If the economic conditions of the general economy or the markets in which we operate worsen from present levels, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.
Our rapid revenue growth may not be indicative of our future revenue growth. Our rapid revenue growth also makes it difficult to evaluate our future prospects and may increase the risk that we will not be successful.
Our revenue was $593.4 million and $471.8 million for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. You should not rely on our historical revenue growth as an indication of our future performance. Even if our revenue continues to increase, we expect that our annual revenue growth rate will decline in the future as a result of a variety of factors, including the maturation of our business. Overall growth of our revenue depends on several factors, including our ability to:
•
expand subscriptions for additional functionality within our platform to our existing customers;
•
expand the products for and functionality of our platform and achieve market acceptance for them;
•
attract new customers, particularly in verticals and organizations where we have already experienced revenue growth;
•
succeed in selling our products outside the United States;
•
continue to partner with existing customers to improve our platform and its products and functionality;
•
keep pace with technological developments;
•
price our platform subscriptions effectively;
•
provide our customers with support that meets their needs;
•
successfully identify and acquire or invest in businesses, products or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our platform; and
•
increase awareness of our brand on a global basis and successfully compete with other companies.
We may not successfully accomplish any of these objectives and, as a result, it is difficult for us to forecast our future results of operations. If the assumptions that we use to plan our business are incorrect or change in reaction to changes in our market or as a result of macroeconomic pressures on us or our customers, or if we are unable to maintain revenue growth, our stock price could be volatile, it may be difficult to achieve and maintain profitability, and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. The adverse effect on our results of operations resulting from a failure to achieve our revenue expectations may be particularly acute because of the significant research, development, marketing, sales and other expenses we expect to incur.
We may require additional capital to support business growth, 
and this capital 
might not be available on acceptable terms, if at all.
 
18
Table 
of Contents
We have funded our operations since inception primarily through equity financings, including through the public markets in our initial public offering, and sales of subscriptions to our platform. We cannot be certain when or if our operations will generate sufficient cash to fully fund our ongoing operations or the growth of our business. We intend to continue to make investments to support our business and may require additional funds to respond to business challenges, including the need to develop new features or enhance our platform, improve our operating infrastructure or acquire complementary businesses and technologies. Accordingly, we may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. Additional financing may not be available on terms favorable to us, including as a result of inflationary pressure and a higher interest rate environment, if at all. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to invest in future growth opportunities, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we incur debt, the debt holders would have rights senior to holders of our Class A and Class B common stock to make claims on our assets, and the terms of any debt could include restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, any of which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities. Furthermore, if we issue equity securities, our stockholders will experience dilution, and the new equity securities could have rights senior to those of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock. Because our decision to issue securities in the future will depend on numerous considerations, including factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing, or nature of any future issuances of debt or equity securities. As a result, our stockholders bear the risk of future issuances of debt or equity securities reducing the value of our Class A common stock and diluting their interests.
We have a limited history operating at our current scale, and our future results of operations may fluctuate significantly due to a wide range of factors, which make it difficult to forecast our future results of operations.
Our results of operations may fluctuate significantly from period to period due to many factors, many of which are outside of our control, including:
•
failure to execute on our growth strategies;
•
the level of demand for our platform;
•
the rate of renewal of subscriptions with, and extent of sales of additional subscriptions to, existing customers;
•
the size, timing, duration and pricing, and other terms of our subscription agreements with existing and new customers;
•
the introduction of new products and product enhancements by existing competitors or new entrants into our market, and changes in pricing for products offered by our competitors;
•
network outages, security breaches and other cyber-attacks, technical difficulties with or interruptions to our platform;
•
customers delaying purchasing decisions in anticipation of new developments or enhancements by us or our competitors or otherwise;
•
changes in customers’ budgets;
•
seasonal variations related to sales and marketing and other activities, such as expenses related to our customers’ increased usage of our platform and products during the fourth quarter;
•
our ability to increase, retain and incentivize the strategic partners that market and sell our platform;
•
the timing of growth of our business, in particular through our hiring of new employees and international expansion;
•
our ability to control our operating expenses and other costs;
•
our ability to hire, train and maintain our direct sales team;
•
unforeseen litigation and inability to enforce, protect or defend our intellectual property, or claims of infringement by third parties;
•
the timing of our adoption of new or revised accounting pronouncements applicable to us and the impact on our results of operations;
•
fluctuations in our effective tax rate; and
•
general economic and political conditions, as well as economic conditions specifically affecting industries in which our customers operate.
Any one of these or other risks or uncertainties discussed elsewhere in this report or the cumulative effect of some of these factors may result in fluctuations in our revenue, results of operations and cash flows, meaning that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our revenue, results of operations and cash flows may not necessarily be indicative of our future performance, may cause us to miss our guidance and analyst expectations and may cause the price of our Class A common stock to decline. Additionally, if our assumptions regarding these risks and uncertainties are incorrect or change, including as a result of global or domestic macroeconomic and socioeconomic conditions such as, among others, instability in the banking and financial services sector, international and domestic supply chain risks, inflationary pressure, interest rate increases, declines in consumer confidence, international conflicts and domestic and foreign political unrest, that impact us and our customers, or if we do not address these risks successfully, our revenue and results of operations could differ materially from our expectations, and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.
We have a history of operating losses and may not achieve or sustain profitability in the future.
19
Table 
of Contents
We have experienced net losses in each of our last several fiscal years. We generated a net loss of $104.0 million, $130.4 million, and $140.7 million for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2025, 2024, and 2023
, 
respectively. We had accumulated deficits of $586.8 million and $483.1 million as of January 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. While we have experienced significant revenue growth in recent periods, we cannot guarantee whether or when we will achieve or maintain profitability in the future. We also expect our costs and expenses to increase in future periods, which could negatively affect our future results of operations if our revenue does not continue to increase. In particular, we intend to continue to expend substantial financial and other resources on:
•
our technology infrastructure and operations, including systems architecture, scalability, availability, performance and security;
•
our sales and marketing organization, to engage our existing and prospective customers, increase brand awareness and drive adoption of our products;
•
platform development, including investments in our platform development team and the development of new products and functionality for our platform, as well as investments in further improving our existing platform and infrastructure;
•
acquisitions or strategic investments;
•
international expansion; and
•
general administration, including increased insurance, legal and accounting expenses associated with being a public company.
These investments may not result in increased revenue. If we are unable to maintain or increase our revenue at a rate sufficient to offset the expected increase in our costs, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected, and we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability over the long term. 
Our customers may face challenges to their businesses as a result of macroeconomic pressures or changes in the interest rate environment. We have in the past, and may in the future, adapt our strategy to address these market dynamics. We cannot guarantee that any change in strategy will be successful and such changes may cause our revenue to decline, which may inhibit our ability to scale our business and prevent us from achieving and maintaining profitability over the long term. Our customers may also terminate their contracts, renew their agreements on terms less favorable to us, or fail to purchase additional product subscriptions. Our historical data and operating experience may also be insufficient to adequately inform our future pricing and contracting strategies in changing market environments. Any reduction in our prices or an increase in our discounting could adversely affect our revenue, gross margin, profitability, financial position, and cash flow.
The estimates of market opportunity and forecasts of market growth may prove to be inaccurate. Even if the market in which we compete achieves the forecasted growth, our business could fail to grow at similar rates, if at all.
Market estimates and growth forecasts are uncertain and based on assumptions and estimates that may be inaccurate. Our addressable market depends on a number of factors, including businesses’ desire to differentiate themselves through digital customer engagement, partnership opportunities, changes in the competitive landscape, technological changes, data security or privacy concerns, customer budgetary constraints, changes in business practices, changes in the regulatory environment and changes in economic conditions. Our estimates and forecasts relating to the size and expected growth of our market may prove to be inaccurate, and our ability to produce accurate estimates and forecasts may be impacted by economic uncertainty that is outside our control, including as a result of global or domestic macroeconomic and socioeconomic conditions such as, among others, instability in the banking and financial services sector, international and domestic supply chain risks, inflationary pressure, interest rate increases, declines in consumer confidence, international conflicts and domestic and foreign political unrest, that impact us and our customers. Any of these risks could have a significant impact on our business or the business of our customers, either of which could result in a material adverse effect on our results and operations and cause our current estimates and projections to be inaccurate. Even if the market in which we compete meets the size estimates and growth rates we forecast, our business could fail to grow at similar rates, if at all. 
We track certain operational metrics with internal systems and tools and do not independently verify such metrics. Certain of our operational metrics are subject to inherent challenges in measurement, and any real or perceived inaccuracies in such metrics may adversely affect our business and reputation. 
We track certain operational metrics, including, among others, the number of customers, monthly active users, platform enabled interactions, consumer generated data points, customer messages, annual recurring revenue, dollar-based net retention rate and Non-GAAP free cash flow. Our operational metrics are tracked with internal systems and tools that are not independently verified by any third party and which may differ from estimates or similar metrics published by third parties due to differences in sources, methodologies, or the assumptions on which we rely. Our internal systems and tools have a number of limitations, and our methodologies for tracking these metrics may change over time, which could result in unexpected changes to our metrics, including the metrics we publicly disclose. If the internal systems and tools we use to track these metrics undercount or overcount performance or contain algorithmic or other technical errors, the data we report may not be accurate. 
20
Table 
of Contents
While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our metrics for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring how our platform is used across large populations. In addition, limitations or errors with respect to how we measure data or with respect to the data that we measure may affect our understanding of certain details of our business, which could affect our long-term strategies. If our operating metrics are not accurate representations of our business, if investors do not perceive our operating metrics to be accurate, or if we discover material inaccuracies with respect to these figures, we expect that our business, reputation, financial condition, and results of operations would be adversely affected.
Risks Related to Our Business and Our Brand
We face intense competition, including from well-established companies that offer products that compete with ours. We may lack sufficient financial or other resources to maintain or improve our competitive position, which may harm our ability to add new customers, retain existing customers, and grow our business.
The market for customer engagement products is evolving and highly competitive. There are several established and emerging competitors that address specific aspects of customer engagement. We face intense competition from software companies that offer marketing solutions, such as legacy marketing clouds like Adobe and Salesforce, and point solutions like Airship, Iterable, Klaviyo, CleverTap and MoEngage. Many of our existing competitors have, and our potential competitors could have, substantial competitive advantages, such as greater name recognition, longer operating histories, larger sales and marketing budgets and resources, greater customer support resources, lower labor and development costs, larger and more mature intellectual property portfolios and substantially greater financial, technical and other resources than we do. In addition, our competitors may have an advantage in markets where our policies regarding the use of customer data are more restrictive than local laws, regulations, policies and standards. For example, competitors willing to sell customer data in markets where such activity is permissible may have a pricing advantage over us in such markets. Any such pricing advantages that our competitors have may negatively affect our ability to gain new customers and retain existing customers. Additionally, to the extent there is a sustained general economic downturn, our customers and potential customers may experience delays and reductions in general customer engagement technology spending. As a result, our competitors have in the past responded, and may continue in the future to respond, to market conditions by lowering prices and attempting to lure away our current and potential customers. With the introduction of new technologies and the entry of new competitors into the market, we expect competition to persist and intensify in the future. In addition, in recent years, there has been significant merger and acquisition activity among our competitors, including the acquisition of Leanplum by CleverTap. Continued merger and acquisition activity in the technology industry could further increase the likelihood that we compete with other large technology companies. This could harm our ability to increase sales, maintain or increase subscription renewals, and maintain our prices.
Conditions in our market could change rapidly and significantly as a result of technological advancements, partnering by our competitors or continuing market consolidation. Some of our larger competitors also have substantially broader product lines and market focus and therefore may not be as susceptible to downturns in a particular market. New start-up companies that innovate, and large companies that are making significant investments in research and development, may invent similar or superior products and technologies that compete with one or more of our platform offerings. In addition, some of our competitors may enter into new alliances with each other or may establish or strengthen cooperative relationships with agency partners, technology and application providers in complementary categories, or other parties. Competitors may also consolidate with existing service providers or strategic partners that we rely on, and as a result we could lose partnerships that are difficult to replace. Any such consolidation, acquisition, alliance or cooperative relationship could lead to pricing pressure, a loss of market share or a smaller addressable share of the market and could result in a competitor with greater financial, technical, marketing, service and other resources, all of which could harm our ability to compete.
Some of our larger competitors may use their broader product offerings to compete with us, including by bundling their competitive products with other products being purchased from that company by a customer or by restricting access to their technology platforms thereby making it more difficult for customers to integrate the use of our platform with other competitor products. Potential customers may prefer to purchase from their existing suppliers rather than a new supplier regardless of product performance or features. Furthermore, potential customers may be more willing to incrementally add solutions to their existing infrastructure from competitors than to replace their existing infrastructure with our platform and products. These competitive pressures in our market, or our failure to compete effectively, may result in price reductions, fewer sales, reduced revenue and gross margins, increased net losses and loss of, or failure to expand, our market share. Any failure to address these challenges could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
If we are unable to attract new customers and renew existing customers, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected.
To increase our revenue, we must continue to attract new customers and retain, and sell more products to, existing customers. Our success will depend to a substantial extent on the widespread adoption of our platform and products as an alternative to existing products in which many enterprises have invested substantial personnel and financial resources and, 
21
Table

therefore, may be reluctant or unwilling to abandon. In addition, as our market matures, our products evolve and competitors introduce lower cost or differentiated products that are perceived to compete with our platform, products and services, our ability to sell subscriptions for our products could be impaired. Similarly, our subscription sales could be adversely affected if customers or users within these organizations perceive that features incorporated into competitive products reduce the need for our products or if they prefer to purchase other products that are bundled with products offered by other companies that operate in adjacent markets and compete with our products. In addition, the value of our products and services to our customers depends, in part, on our customers’ ability to use them as part of an overall effective marketing strategy. To the extent our customers’ marketing strategies are not effective, they may reduce the use of our products and services or fail to renew their existing contracts. Further, to the extent there is a sustained general economic downturn and our customers and potential customers experience delays or reductions in general customer engagement technology spending, potential customers may be unwilling to take on the additional cost associated with adopting our platform as an alternative to their existing products or service providers, and if they choose to adopt our platform, they may not purchase additional products and services in the future due to budget limitations. As a result of these and other factors, we may be unable to attract new customers, which may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
If we fail to adapt and respond effectively to rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, or changing regulations, or to changing customer or consumer needs, requirements or preferences, our platform may become less competitive.
Our ability to attract new customers and increase revenue from existing customers depends in large part on our ability to enhance and improve our platform and its products and functionality, increase adoption and usage of our platform, and introduce new products and functionality. The market in which we compete is subject to rapid technological change, evolving industry standards and changing regulations, as well as changing customer and consumer needs, requirements and preferences, including changes in the use of channels through which consumers desire to communicate with brands. Additionally, we cannot predict what, if any, actions regulators will take regarding the use and sale of customer engagement software or in our key markets in the future. Any regulatory restrictions on the use of customer engagement tools from domestic or foreign regulators could reduce demand for our platform in the United States and foreign markets. Further, recent advances in, and the public availability of, generative artificial intelligence may be a significant disruptor in consumer engagement and marketing strategies. The success of our business will depend, in part, on our ability to adapt and respond effectively to these changes on a timely basis. If we are unable to enhance our platform offerings to keep pace with rapid technological and regulatory change, or if new technologies emerge that are able to deliver competitive products at lower prices, more efficiently, more conveniently or more securely than our platform, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. Further as we develop, acquire, and introduce new services and technologies, including those that may incorporate artificial intelligence and machine learning, we may be subject to new or heightened legal, ethical, and other challenges.
The success of our platform depends, in part, on our ability to continuously modify and enhance our platform to adapt to changes and innovation in existing and new technologies to maintain and grow our integrations. We expect that the number of integrations with our customers’ infrastructure that we will need to support will continue to expand as developers adopt new software solutions, and we will have to develop new versions of our platform to work with those new solutions. This development effort may require significant engineering, sales and marketing resources, all of which could adversely affect our business. Any failure of our platform to operate effectively with customer infrastructures could reduce the demand for our platform, and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.
We are substantially dependent upon customers renewing their subscriptions to, and expanding their use of, our platform to maintain and grow our revenue, which requires us to scale our platform infrastructure and business quickly enough to meet our customers’ growing needs. If we are not able to grow in an efficient manner, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed.
As usage of our platform grows and as customers use it for more complex projects, we may need to devote additional resources to improving our platform architecture, updating our platform’s products and functionality, integrating with third-party systems and maintaining infrastructure performance. In addition, we will need to appropriately scale our internal business as well as grow our partner services network to serve our growing customer base, particularly as our customer base expands over time. Our ability to scale our business is dependent on our ability to maintain and grow our revenue through new and renewed customer subscriptions to our platform, from which we derive substantially all of our revenue. We cannot assure you that we will be able to renew subscriptions with any of our customers at the same or higher contract value, particularly if our customers experience reductions or delays in general customer engagement technology spending in connection with a sustained general economic downturn. In addition, some customers have multiple order forms with different divisions of their entities, which could increase the complexity of negotiating renewals.
The market for customer engagement products is still evolving, and competitive dynamics may cause our pricing to change as the market matures and as existing and new market participants introduce new types of products and different approaches to enable customers to address their needs. As a result, we may be forced to reduce the prices we charge for our 
22
Table 
of Contents
subscriptions and may be required to offer terms less favorable to us for new and renewal agreements, particularly for mid- to large-size enterprises that may demand substantial price discounts as part of the negotiation of subscription contracts.
Further, some of our contracts limit the amount we can increase prices from period to period or include pricing guarantees. Accordingly, these pricing restrictions may cause the revenue generated from these contracts to not keep pace with our costs, particularly if we are adversely affected by increasing costs caused by inflation, including labor and employee benefit costs. We have in the past, and may in the future, adapt our strategy to address these market dynamics for customers that were significantly negatively impacted by the macroeconomic environment. We cannot guarantee that any change in strategy will be successful and such changes may cause our revenue to decline, which may inhibit our ability to scale our business and prevent us from achieving and maintaining profitability over the long term. Our customers may also terminate their contracts, renew their agreements on terms less favorable to us, or fail to purchase additional product subscriptions. As such, our revenue may decline, and, as a result, our ability to scale our business may be impaired and our business, financial condition and results of operations would likely be harmed as a result. 
Any failure of or delay in efforts to scale our business could cause difficulty or delay in deploying our products or functionality to customers, could lead to impaired performance, other declines in quality or customer satisfaction, increased costs, difficulty in introducing new features or other operational inefficiencies or failures. These issues could reduce the attractiveness of our platform to customers, resulting in decreased subscriptions with existing and new customers, lower subscription renewal rates, the issuance of service credits or requests for refunds, which could hurt our revenue growth and our reputation. Even if we can upgrade our systems and expand our staff, any such expansion will be expensive and complex, requiring management time and attention, as well as improvements to our operational and financial controls and reporting systems and procedures. Because of these risks and other inherent risks associated with upgrading, improving and expanding our information technology systems, any needed expansion and improvements to our infrastructure and systems may not be fully or effectively implemented on a timely basis, if at all. Any such expansion efforts may reduce revenue or may not bring the benefits we anticipate, and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.
Failure to effectively develop our sales and marketing capabilities could harm our ability to expand our customer base and achieve broader market adoption of our platform and products.
Our ability to expand our customer base and achieve broader market adoption of our platform will depend on the productivity of our sales and marketing operations. We plan to continue expanding our sales team and strategic partners over the long term, both domestically and internationally; however, there is no assurance that we will be successful in attracting and retaining talented sales personnel or strategic partners or that any new sales personnel will be able to achieve productivity in a reasonable period of time or at all. We also plan to dedicate significant resources to sales and marketing programs to drive new customer acquisition, as well as engage with customers to promote upsell and cross-sell opportunities. For example, to encourage awareness, usage, familiarity and adoption of our platform and products, we offer free trials of our platform. This strategy may not be successful in leading customers to purchase long term subscriptions of our product, as usage of our free tier may not cause users or others within their organization to purchase and deploy our platform. We also engage with industry analysts, consulting firms, marketing service providers, data and technology partners, marketing agencies and other solution partners, business and trade press, and other industry experts who exert considerable influence in our market to promote our platform and our brand. Our business, financial condition and results of operations may be harmed if our sales and marketing efforts do not generate a corresponding increase in revenue. In addition, we may not achieve anticipated revenue growth from expanding our sales team if we are unable to hire, develop and retain talented sales personnel, if our new sales personnel are unable to achieve desired productivity levels in a reasonable period of time, or if our sales and marketing programs are not effective. If the cost of marketing our platform and products increases or competition reduces the effectiveness of our marketing efforts, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.
We are dependent on a single platform, and the failure to achieve continued market acceptance of our platform could cause our results of operations to suffer.
Substantially all of our revenue is attributable to subscriptions for our cloud-based platform. We expect that we will be substantially dependent on our platform to generate revenue for the foreseeable future. As a result, our results of operations could suffer due to:
•
any decline in demand for our platform, including as a result of reductions or delays in general customer engagement technology spending by our customers and potential customers in connection with a sustained general economic downturn;
•
the failure of our platform to achieve continued market acceptance;
•
the market for our platform not continuing to grow, or growing more slowly than we expect;
•
the introduction of products and technologies that serve as a replacement or substitute for, or represent an improvement over, our platform;
•
technological innovations or new standards that our platform does not address;
23
Table 
of Contents
•
incidents or interruptions with third-party service providers or vendors, including Apple or Google services, that affect the ability of our customers to use our platform;
•
sensitivity to current or future prices offered by us or our competitors;
•
our inability to release enhanced versions of our platform on a timely basis;
•
the development of new communication channels with which we are not able to adequately integrate our platform; and
•
changes to mobile devices and platforms that prevent or degrade the functionality of our platform, or our inability to maintain interoperability of our platform with such mobile devices and platforms.
If the market for our platform grows more slowly than anticipated or if demand for our products does not grow as quickly as anticipated, whether as a result of competition, pricing sensitivities, product obsolescence, technological change, unfavorable economic conditions, uncertain geopolitical environment, budgetary constraints of our customers or other factors, we may not be able to grow our revenue, and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.
If our platform fails to perform properly or there are defects or disruptions in the rollout of our platform updates or enhancements, our reputation could be adversely affected, our market share could decline, and we could be subject to liability claims.
Our platform is inherently complex and may contain material defects or errors. Any defects or errors that impact functionality or that cause interruptions in the availability of our platform could result in:
•
loss or delayed market acceptance and subscriptions;
•
breach of warranty claims;
•
breach of contract claims;
•
sales credits or refunds for prepaid amounts;
•
loss of customers;
•
diversion of development and support resources; and
•
injury to our reputation.
The costs we would be forced to incur to correct any material defects or errors could be substantial and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our customer agreements often provide service level commitments. We have in the past, and may in the future, fail to meet the stated service level commitments or suffer extended periods of unavailability of our platform. Any such incident could result in us being obligated to provide these customers with service credits. We could also face contract terminations or refusal by certain of our customers to renew as a result of any such outages. We outsource substantially all the infrastructure relating to our cloud-based platform to third-party hosting providers and, as a result, our services may be impacted in the future, and have been impacted in the past, by unscheduled downtime at such providers that is beyond our control. Our revenue has in the past been affected, and could be significantly affected in the future, by unscheduled downtime that exceeds the allowed downtimes under our agreements with our customers.
Because of the large amount of data that we collect, process, transmit, store and manage, it is possible that hardware failures or errors in our systems could result in data loss or cause the information that we collect to be incomplete which may result in breach of contract claims, damage our reputation or subject us to regulatory fines or investigations. Furthermore, the availability or performance of our platform could be adversely affected by a number of factors outside our control, including customers’ inability to access the internet, the failure of software systems caused by our third-party vendors, security breaches, cyberattacks or variability in user traffic for our services. For example, our customers access our platform through their internet service providers. If a customer’s service provider fails to provide sufficient capacity to support our platform or otherwise experiences service outages, such failure could interrupt our customers’ access to our platform and adversely affect their perception of our platform’s reliability. In addition to potential liability, if we experience interruptions in the availability of our cloud-based platform, our reputation could be adversely affected, and we could lose customers or have difficulty acquiring new customers.
We also provide frequent incremental releases of updates and functional enhancements to our platform. Despite extensive pre-release testing, such new versions occasionally contain undetected errors when first introduced or released. We have, from time to time, found errors in our platform, and new errors in our platform may be detected in the future. Since our customers use our products for important aspects of their business, any errors, defects, disruptions in our platform or other performance problems with our solutions could hurt our reputation and may damage our customers’ businesses. If that occurs, some of our customers may delay or withhold payment to us, elect not to renew their subscriptions with us, make service credit claims, warranty claims or other claims against us, and we could lose future sales. The occurrence of any of these events could result in an increase in our bad debt expense, an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable or a decrease in future revenue and earnings, or could cause us to incur the risk or expense of litigation.

We may need to reduce prices or change our pricing model to remain competitive.
Our subscription fees are principally based on an upfront commitment by our customers for a specific number of monthly active users, messaging volume, platform access and/or support and certain add-on products. We expect that we may need to change our pricing from time to time. As new or existing competitors introduce products that compete with ours or reduce their prices, we may be unable to attract new customers or retain existing customers. We also must determine the appropriate price to enable us to compete effectively internationally. Customers may demand substantial price discounts as part of the negotiation of subscription agreements. As a result, we may be required or choose to reduce our prices or otherwise change our pricing model, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our sales cycle with large enterprise customers can be long and unpredictable, and our sales efforts require considerable time and expense.
The timing of our sales cycles with our large enterprise customers and related revenue recognition is difficult to predict because of the length and unpredictability of the sales cycle for these customers. Large enterprise customers may have a lengthy sales cycle for the evaluation and procurement of our platform. Additionally, to the extent there is a sustained general economic downturn resulting in delays or reductions in general customer engagement technology spending by large enterprise customers, we may experience an extension of our sales cycle with potential customers or a reduction in sales cycle win rates due to budgetary constraints. Any delays in our sales cycles may cause a delay between increasing operating expenses for such sales efforts and, upon successful sales, the generation of corresponding revenue. We are often required to spend significant time and resources to better educate our potential large enterprise customers and familiarize them with the platform. The length of our sales cycle for these customers, from initial evaluation to contract execution, is generally three to six months but can vary substantially and sometimes extend for over 12 months. Large enterprise customers often view a subscription to our platform and products as a strategic decision with significant investment. As a result, customers frequently require considerable time to evaluate, test and qualify our platform prior to entering into or expanding a subscription. During the sales cycle, we expend significant time and money on sales and marketing and contract negotiation activities, which may not result in a sale. Moreover, large enterprise customers may demand complicated configuration and integration services, which can increase our upfront investment with no guarantee that these customers will deploy our offering widely enough across their organization to justify our substantial upfront investment. Further, if we are not able to satisfy the demands of our enterprise customers, we may also face reputational harm.
Additional factors that may influence the length and variability of our sales cycle include:
•
the effectiveness of our sales team as we hire and train our new salespeople to sell to large enterprise customers;
•
our ability to meet with customers in person during a sales cycle;
•
the discretionary nature of purchasing and budget cycles and decisions;
•
the obstacles placed by customers’ procurement process;
•
economic conditions and other factors impacting customer budgets;
•
customers’ familiarity with our products;
•
customers’ evaluation of competing products during the purchasing process; and
•
evolving customer demands.
Given these factors, it is difficult to predict whether and when a sale will be completed. Consequently, a shortfall in demand for our products and services or a decline in new or renewed contracts in a given period may not significantly reduce our revenue for that period but could negatively affect our revenue in future periods, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our business and reputation could be adversely affected if our customers are not satisfied with the integration, implementation, or services provided by us or our partners.
The success of our business depends on our customers’ satisfaction with our platform, the support that we provide for our platform and the services that we provide to help integrate and utilize our platform. Onboarding services may be performed by our own staff, by a third party or by a combination of the two. We have partnered with third parties to increase the breadth, capability and depth of capacity for delivery of these onboarding services to our customers, and third parties provide a significant portion of such support. If a customer is not satisfied with the quality of work performed by us or a third party or with the solutions delivered, we could incur additional costs to address the deficiency, which would diminish the profitability of the customer relationship. If we do not help our customers quickly resolve issues and provide effective ongoing support, our ability to sell new products to existing and new customers will suffer and our reputation with existing or potential customers will be harmed, even if the dissatisfaction is with services provided by a third party partner. Further, customer dissatisfaction with our services could impair our ability to expand the subscriptions within our customer base or adversely affect our customers’ renewal of existing subscriptions. In addition, negative publicity related to our customer relationships, regardless of 
25
Table

accuracy, may further damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new business with actual and prospective customers.
Because we generally recognize revenue ratably over the term of each subscription agreement, downturns or upturns in our sales may not be immediately reflected in our financial condition and results of operations.
We recognize revenue ratably over the term of each subscription agreement. Consequently, while a decline in new sales or renewals in any one period may not be reflected in our revenue for that period, this decline will negatively affect our revenue in future periods. Accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our products and potential changes in our rate of renewals may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. Our model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers generally is recognized over the term of the applicable agreement.
If we fail to maintain and enhance our brand, our ability to expand our customer base may be impaired and our business, financial condition and results of operations may suffer.
We believe that maintaining and enhancing our brand is important to support the marketing and sale of our existing and future products to new customers and expand sales of our platform and products to existing customers. We also believe that the importance of brand recognition will increase as competition in our market increases. Successfully maintaining and enhancing our brand will depend largely on the effectiveness of our marketing efforts, our ability to provide reliable products that continue to meet the needs of our customers at competitive prices, our ability to maintain our customers’ trust, our ability to continue to develop new functionality and use cases, and our ability to successfully differentiate our products and platform capabilities from competitive products. If we are not able to effectively differentiate our platform and its capabilities from those of our competitors, we may experience difficulty in attracting new customers. Our brand promotion activities may not generate customer awareness or yield increased revenue and, even if they do, any increased revenue may not offset the expenses we incur in building our brand. If we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brand, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.
If we fail to manage our growth effectively, we may be unable to execute our business plan, maintain high levels of service and customer satisfaction or adequately address competitive challenges.
We may continue to experience rapid growth and organizational change, which may continue to place significant demands on our management and our operational and financial resources. We have also experienced growth in the number of customers, the number of engagements we enable and the amount of data that our infrastructure supports. In particular, acquiring and supporting enterprise customers can require significant resources due to their size, volume of messaging and complexity. Our success will depend in part on our ability to manage this growth effectively. We will require significant capital expenditures and valuable management resources to grow without undermining our culture of innovation, teamwork and attention to customer success, which has been central to our growth so far.
We intend to continue to expand our international operations in the future. Our expansion will continue to place a significant strain on our managerial, administrative, financial and other resources. If we are unable to manage our growth successfully, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.
It is important that we maintain a high level of customer services, integration services, technical support and satisfaction as we expand our business. As our customer base continues to grow and as our penetration within existing customers expands, we will need to expand our account management, customer service and other personnel. Failure to manage growth could result in difficulty or delays in launching our platform, declines in quality or customer satisfaction, increases in costs, difficulties in introducing new features, or other operational difficulties. Any of these could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We anticipate that our operations will continue to increase in complexity as we grow, which will create management challenges.
Our business has experienced strong growth and is complex. We expect this growth to continue and for our operations to become increasingly complex. To manage this growth, we continue to make substantial investments to improve our operational, financial and management controls as well as our reporting systems and procedures. We may not be able to implement and scale improvements to our systems and processes in a timely or efficient manner or in a manner that does not negatively affect our results of operations. For example, we may not be able to effectively monitor certain contract requirements for specific products. We may have difficulty managing improvements to our systems, processes and controls or in connection with third-party software, which could impair our ability to provide our platform to our customers, causing us to lose customers, limiting our platform to less significant updates or increasing our technical support costs. If we are unable to manage this complexity, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.

As our customer base continues to grow, we will need to expand our services and other personnel, and maintain and enhance our partnerships, to provide a high level of customer service. We also will need to manage our sales processes as our sales personnel and partner network continue to grow and become more complex and as we continue to expand into new geographies and market segments. If we do not effectively manage this increasing complexity, the quality of our platform and customer service could suffer, and we may not be able to adequately address competitive challenges. These factors could impair our ability to attract and retain customers and expand our customers’ use of our platform.
We depend on our senior management team and the loss of one or more key employees or an inability to attract and retain highly skilled employees could adversely affect our business.
Our success depends largely upon the continued services of our executive officers, particularly our chief executive officer. We rely heavily on our chief executive officer’s vision, expertise and reputation. We rely on our leadership team for research and development, marketing, sales, services and general and administrative functions, and on mission-critical individual contributors. From time to time, our executive management team may change due to the hiring or departure of executives, which could disrupt our business. We do not have employment agreements with our executive officers or other key personnel that require them to continue to work for us for any specified period; therefore, they could terminate their employment with us at any time. The loss of one or more of our executive officers, particularly our chief executive officer, or key employees (including any limitation on the performance of their duties or short-term or long-term absences as a result of illness or disability) could have a serious adverse effect on our business.
To execute our growth plan, we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel. Competition for these personnel is intense, especially for experienced software engineers and senior sales executives. We expect to continue to experience difficulty in hiring and retaining employees with appropriate qualifications. In addition, as a result of our hybrid work model, we have a large, remote workforce, which adds to the complexity and costs of our business operations. Our hybrid work model may impact our ability to identify, hire and train new personnel. Also, as a public company, potential candidates may not perceive our compensation package, including our equity awards, as favorably as employees hired prior to our initial public offering or as compared to our private competitors. In addition, our recruiting personnel, methodology and approach may need to be altered to address a changing candidate pool and profile. We may not be able to identify or implement such changes in a timely manner. If we fail to attract new personnel, experience significant turnover or the loss of key personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, it could adversely affect our business and future growth prospects. Further, many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have. If we hire employees from competitors or other companies, their former employers may attempt to assert that these employees or we have breached legal obligations, resulting in a diversion of our time and resources.
If we are unable to maintain our culture and core values as we grow, we could lose the innovation, teamwork, passion and focus on execution that we believe contribute to our success, and our business may be harmed.
We believe our culture and core values are critical to our success and have delivered tangible financial and operational benefits to our customers, employees and stockholders. We are a mission-driven company and have designed our core values as a guiding set of principles for our employees and business. Accordingly, we have invested substantial time and resources in building a team that reflects our culture and core values. As we grow and develop our infrastructure as a public company, our operations may become increasingly complex. We may find it difficult to maintain these important aspects of our culture and core values. In addition, the growth of our remote workforce may impact our ability to preserve our culture and core values. Any failure to preserve our culture or core values could negatively affect our future success, including our ability to retain and recruit personnel, and to effectively focus on and pursue our corporate objectives.
Indemnity provisions in various agreements potentially expose us to substantial liability for intellectual property infringement, violations of privacy, data protection and other laws, regulations or contractual obligations, data breaches and other losses.
Many of our agreements with customers and certain other third parties include indemnification provisions under which we agree to indemnify them for losses suffered or incurred as a result of claims of intellectual property infringement, violation of applicable privacy, data protection or other laws, regulations or contractual obligations, data breaches or other liabilities relating to or arising from our platform, products or other contractual obligations. Some of these agreements provide for uncapped liability for losses caused by claims alleging gross negligence or willful misconduct, or claims alleging third party intellectual property infringement, and some indemnity provisions survive termination or expiration of the applicable agreement. While we generally cap all other liabilities, in some instances, the cap may represent a significant amount of potential liability, and such large indemnity payments could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Although we normally contractually limit our liability with respect to these obligations, we may still incur substantial liability related to them and we may be required to cease use of certain functionalities offered by our platform as a result of any such claims. Additionally, while we maintain insurance related to these matters, this insurance might not cover all such claims, 
27
Table 
of Contents
provide sufficient payments to cover all the costs to resolve one or more of such claims or continue to be available on terms acceptable to us. A claim brought against us that is uninsured or under-insured could result in unanticipated costs, and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. Further, any dispute with a customer with respect to such obligations could have adverse effects on our relationship with that customer, other existing customers and new customers, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our current operations are international in scope, and we plan further geographic expansion. This will create a variety of operational challenges. If we are not successful in sustaining and expanding our international business, we may incur additional losses and our revenue growth could be harmed. 
A component of our growth strategy involves the further expansion of our operations and customer base internationally, which will require significant dedication of management attention and financial resources. We are continuing to adapt to and develop strategies to address international markets, but there is no guarantee that such efforts will have the desired effect. We currently have customers in North America, Europe, the Middle East, the Asia-Pacific region and Latin America. We are continuing to adapt and develop strategies to address international markets, but such efforts may not be successful. In addition, any future stay-at-home, business closure and other restrictive orders and travel restrictions into and outside the United States as a result of international conflicts, domestic unrest or the emergence of new highly infectious diseases, if any, may pose additional challenges for international expansion and may impact our ability to launch new locations and further expand geographically. 
Our ability to expand internationally involves various risks, including the need to invest significant resources in such expansion, and the possibility that returns on such investments will not be achieved in the near future or at all in these less familiar competitive environments. We may also choose to conduct our international business through strategic partnerships or other collaboration arrangements. If we are unable to identify partners or negotiate favorable terms, our international growth may be limited. In addition, we have incurred and may continue to incur significant expenses in advance of generating material revenue as we attempt to establish our presence in certain international markets. 
We expect that our international activities will continue to grow over the foreseeable future as we continue to pursue opportunities in existing and new international markets. This and any other future expansion of our international activities and operations will require significant management attention and financial resources.
Our current international operations and future initiatives involve a variety of risks, including:
•
changes in a country’s or region’s political or economic conditions;
•
the need to adapt and localize our platform for specific countries;
•
greater difficulty collecting accounts receivable and longer payment cycles;
•
unexpected changes in laws, regulatory requirements, taxes or trade laws;
•
more stringent regulations relating to privacy, data security and data protection and the collection, transmission, use or other processing of, or access to, sensitive, proprietary, confidential, regulated and personal data, particularly in Europe;
•
differing labor regulations, especially in regions where labor laws are generally more advantageous to employees as compared to the United States, including deemed hourly wage and overtime regulations in some of these locations;
•
difficulties in managing a business in new markets with diverse cultures, languages, customs, legal systems, alternative dispute systems and regulatory systems;
•
increased travel, real estate, infrastructure and legal compliance costs associated with international operations;
•
currency exchange rate fluctuations and the resulting effect on our revenue and expenses and the cost and risk of entering into hedging transactions if we chose to do so in the future;
•
laws and business practices favoring local competitors or general preferences for local vendors;
•
limited or insufficient intellectual property protection or difficulties enforcing our intellectual property;
•
political instability, economic sanctions, terrorist activities, or international conflicts, may impact the operations of our business or the businesses of our customers;
•
risks related to global health epidemics and related restrictions on our ability and our customers’ ability to travel;
•
exposure to liabilities under anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, or the FCPA, the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. § 201, the U.S. Travel Act, the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010, the U.K. Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 and similar laws and regulations in other jurisdictions; and
•
adverse tax burdens and foreign exchange controls that could make it difficult to repatriate earnings and cash.
Failure to overcome any of these difficulties could negatively affect our results of operations. If we invest substantial time and resources to expand our international operations and are unable to do so successfully, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.

We have a limited history of operating with a substantial remote workforce and the long-term impact of this workplace arrangement on our financial results and business operations is uncertain.
In September 2022, we implemented our hybrid work model, pursuant to which each department may choose to have its employees function primarily as in-person, remote or hybrid workers. We have also hired a large number of employees who are permanently remote, regardless of their department’s determination. As a result, remote work has become the primary experience for a large number of our employees, and our intention is for our workforce to continue to have remote work opportunities into the future. However, we have a limited history of operating with a large remote workforce and, while we anticipate that implementing our hybrid work model will have a long-term positive impact on our financial results and business operations, the impact remains uncertain, particularly in the near term. Additionally, there is no guarantee that we will realize any anticipated benefits to our business, including any cost savings, operational efficiencies or productivity.
Our continuing shift to hybrid and remote work may make it increasingly difficult to manage our business and adequately oversee our employees and business functions, potentially resulting in harm to our company culture, increased employee attrition, the loss of key personnel, difficulty in properly classifying employees and a potentially negative impact on product research and development, and the growth of our business. We may also experience an increased risk of privacy and data security breaches and incidents involving our or our customers’ data as a result of the decentralization of the technology used to operate our business. The mobility of our remote workers may also subject us to an increased risk of regulatory claims if our remote employees establish a nexus for our business in unanticipated jurisdictions. This could cause us to be subject to tax and employment claims in the applicable jurisdiction. Any of these factors could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.
We may also face operational or other challenges as we and our customers, partners, suppliers and vendors and other parties with whom we do business continue to adjust to a hybrid model of remote and onsite work. These challenges may result in operational inefficiencies or employee dissatisfaction, either of which could harm our business.
Acquisitions, strategic investments, partnerships or alliances pose integration challenges, divert the attention of management, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We have in the past and may in the future seek to acquire or invest in businesses, joint ventures, products and platform capabilities, or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our products and platform capabilities, enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities. For example, in March 2025, we announced our planned acquisition of OfferFit, Inc., a modern agentic AI company, for $325 million, using a combination of cash and shares of our Class A common stock. The cash consideration in this transaction uses a significant portion of the proceeds from our initial public offering. This acquisition, and any other acquisition or investment we may make in the future, may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. In particular, we may encounter difficulties assimilating or integrating the businesses, technologies, products and platform capabilities, personnel or operations of any acquired companies, including those of OfferFit, particularly if the key personnel of an acquired company choose not to work for us, their software is not easily adapted to work with our platform or we have difficulty retaining the customers of any acquired business due to changes in ownership, management or otherwise. These transactions may also disrupt our business, divert our resources and require significant management attention that would otherwise be available for development of our existing business. Any such transactions that we are able to complete may not result in any synergies or operational, financial or other benefits we had expected to achieve, which could result in impairment charges that could be substantial. Additionally, we will fund approximately 42% of the OfferFit acquisition with the issuance of shares of our Class A common stock, which will have a dilutive impact. Future transactions could also result in dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if the resulting business from such a transaction, including OfferFit, fails to meet our expectations, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected, or we may be exposed to unknown risks or liabilities.
Risks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties
Our business depends on our ability to send consumer engagement messages over a number of different channels and any significant disruption in service with our third-party providers or on mobile operating systems could result in a loss of customers or less effective consumer-brand engagement, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our brand, reputation and ability to attract new customers depend on the reliable performance of our technology infrastructure and content delivery. Our platform engages with consumers through a number of channels and integrations, and we are dependent on third-party providers for delivery of content in many of these channels and integrations, including, among others, emails, SMS/MMS/RCS, third-party messaging services and audience sync advertising campaigns. We are also dependent on Apple services and Google services for delivery of mobile and web notifications. If any of these third-party 
29
Table 
of Contents
providers change their policies regarding the delivery of certain messages or content, or if our customers do not comply with these third-party providers’ current policies or procedures, some of our customers may no longer be able to use the applicable channels and integrations through our platform. Further, if any of these third-party providers were to suspend or terminate our customers’ use of their services or to suffer extended service outages, then our customers may not be able to deliver the applicable messages or content using our platform. If this were to occur, it could lead to customer dissatisfaction, harm to our reputation or subject us to liability, any of which may harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. For instance, any incident broadly affecting the interaction of Apple or Android devices with necessary Apple or Google services (e.g., iCloud or Apple push notifications), including any delays or interruptions in such Apple or Google services, could adversely affect our business. Further, any cybersecurity events affecting Apple or Google Android devices could result in a disruption to Apple or Google services, regulatory investigations, reputational damage and a loss of sales and customers for Apple or Google, which could in turn impact our business. A prolonged disruption, cybersecurity event or any other negative event affecting Apple or Google could lead to customer dissatisfaction and could in turn damage our reputation with current and potential customers, expose us to liability and cause us to lose customers or otherwise harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. We will also face similar risks as we add new channels and integrations to our platform that are supported by third parties if such third parties were to face similar challenges or disruptions with regard to their respective channels or integrations. Additionally, many of the third parties that we use or with which we integrate hold us responsible for the acts and omissions of our customers. While we contractually obligate our customers to comply with the requirements of third-party providers and applicable laws when using our platform to deliver content through our messaging channels or integrations, we cannot guarantee that all customers will do so at all times. If any of our customers were to use our platform in violation of the policies of third-party providers or applicable law, even without our knowledge, we may be subject to financial penalties and reputational harm.
We depend in part on mobile operating systems, such as Android and iOS, and their respective infrastructures, to send notifications through various applications that utilize our platform. Any changes in such systems that negatively impact the functionality of our platform could adversely affect our ability to interact with consumers in a timely and effective fashion, which could adversely affect our ability to retain and attract new customers. For example, any anti-tracking features adopted by Apple or Google that require applications to obtain additional permissions to track end user data may impact our customers’ decisions relating to how to interact with end users through our platform. Additionally, if such mobile operating systems change their policies or otherwise limit or prohibit us from sending notifications or otherwise make changes that degrade the functionality of our platform, such changes could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
As new mobile devices and mobile, web, email and other messaging platforms are released, there is no guarantee that these mobile devices and platforms will continue to support our platform or effectively roll out updates to our customers’ applications. The parties that control the operating systems for mobile devices and such platforms have no obligation to test the interoperability of new mobile devices or platforms with our platform, and third parties may produce new products that are incompatible with or not optimal for the operation of our platform. Additionally, in order to deliver high-quality customer engagement, we need to ensure that our platform is designed to work effectively with a range of mobile technologies, systems, networks and standards. If consumers choose to use products or platforms that do not support our platform, or if we do not ensure our platform can work effectively with such products or platforms, our business and growth could be harmed. We also may not be successful in developing or maintaining relationships with key participants in the mobile industry that permit such interoperability. If we are unable to adapt to changes in popular operating systems, we expect that our customer retention and customer growth would be adversely affected.
We rely upon third-party providers of cloud-based infrastructure, including Amazon Web Services and Rackspace, to host our products. Any disruption in the operations of these third-party providers or limitations on capacity or interference with our use could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We outsource substantially all the infrastructure relating to our cloud-based platform to third-party hosting providers. Our customers need to be able to access our platform at any time, without interruption or degradation of performance, and we provide many of them with service-level commitments with respect to uptime and, occasionally, throughput. Our products depend on protecting the virtual cloud infrastructure hosted by third-party hosting providers by maintaining its configuration, architecture, features and interconnection specifications, as well as the information stored in these virtual data centers, which is transmitted by third-party internet service providers. Any limitation on the capacity or availability of our third-party hosting providers could impede our ability to onboard new customers or expand the usage of our existing customers, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Currently, we rely on cloud computing infrastructure, particularly from Amazon Web Services, or AWS, to host our platform and support our operations and many of the internal products we use to operate our business. We also host our end user profiles on Rackspace. We do not have control over the operations of the facilities of AWS, Rackspace or other cloud providers. Each provider’s respective facilities may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, cybersecurity attacks, security breaches, terrorist attacks, power losses, service outages, software or hardware failures, telecommunications failures and other events 
30

beyond our or their control. In the event that AWS’s, Rackspace’s or any other third-party provider’s systems or service abilities are hindered by any of the events discussed above, our ability to operate our platform may be impaired, our customers may be impacted, we may be subject to claims for refunds or terminations under our contracts, and our reputation and brand may be harmed. A decision to close these facilities without adequate notice, or other unanticipated problems, could result in lengthy interruptions to our platform. All of the aforementioned risks may be exacerbated if our or our partners’ business continuity and disaster recovery plans prove to be inadequate in such a scenario.
Additionally, AWS, Rackspace or other cloud providers may experience threats, attacks or security breaches from computer malware, ransomware, viruses, social engineering (including phishing attacks), denial-of-service or other attacks, employee error, theft or misuse and general hacking, including from state-sponsored or criminal hacking groups, which have become more prevalent in our industry. Any of these security incidents could result in unauthorized access or damage to, or the disablement, encryption, use or misuse, disclosure, modification, destruction or loss of our data or our customers’ data, including personal data, or disrupt our ability to provide our platform or services. Our platform’s continuing and uninterrupted performance is critical to our success. Customers may become dissatisfied by any system failure that interrupts our ability to provide our platform to them and could make claims for refunds or terminations under our contracts. We may not be able to easily switch our AWS or Rackspace operations to another cloud or other data center provider if there are disruptions or interference with our use of any third-party provider’s services, and even if we do switch our operations, the process can require significant time and expense and other cloud and data center providers are subject to the same risks. Sustained or repeated system failures would reduce the attractiveness of our platform to our customers, thereby reducing revenue. Moreover, negative publicity arising from these types of disruptions could damage our reputation and may adversely impact use of our platform. We may not carry sufficient business interruption insurance or have sufficient contractual remedies to compensate us for losses that may occur as a result of any events that cause interruptions in our service.
In the event that our service agreements with our third-party hosting providers are terminated or there is a lapse of service, elimination of services or features that we utilize, interruption of internet service provider connectivity or damage to such facilities, we could experience interruptions in access to our platform as well as significant delays and additional expense in arranging or creating new facilities and services and/or re-architecting our cloud solution for deployment on a different cloud infrastructure service provider, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our agreement with AWS allows AWS to terminate for any reason with 30 days’ advance notice or in case of a breach of contract if such breach is uncured for 30 days. AWS may also terminate immediately upon notice if (1) AWS determines that our use of its service poses a security risk to its services or any other third party, could otherwise adversely impact AWS’s systems, could subject AWS to liability or could be fraudulent, (2) we fail to pay AWS in accordance with our agreement, (3) we cease to operate in the ordinary course, make an assignment for the benefit of creditors or become the subject of any bankruptcy, reorganization, liquidation, dissolution or other similar proceeding, (4) AWS’s relationship with any third-party providers terminates or requires AWS to change the way it provides services or (5) termination is necessary to comply with the law or the requests of governmental entities. Although we expect that we could receive similar services from other third parties if any of our arrangements with AWS are terminated, transitioning the cloud infrastructure currently hosted by AWS to alternative providers would likely be disruptive, and we could incur significant one-time costs. If we are unable to renew our agreement with AWS on commercially reasonable terms or at all, our agreement with AWS is prematurely terminated or we add additional infrastructure providers, we may experience costs or downtime in connection with the transfer to, or the addition of, new data center providers. If AWS or other infrastructure providers increase the costs of their services, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
Our growth depends in part on the success of our strategic relationships with third parties.
In order to grow our business, we anticipate that we will continue to depend on relationships with strategic partners, including cloud alliance/marketing, infrastructure and technology partners, to provide broader customer coverage and solution delivery capabilities, and also achieve product stickiness. While our strategic partners have not played a lead role in our customer generation process in the past, we intend to develop these relationships to rely more heavily on our partners to help us generate business going forward. Identifying partners, and negotiating, documenting and maintaining relationships with them, requires significant time and resources. Our agreements with our strategic partners are non-exclusive and do not prohibit them from working with our competitors or recommending competing products. Our competitors may be effective in providing incentives to such third parties to favor their products or services or to prevent or reduce subscriptions to our services. If our partners choose to place greater emphasis on products of their own or those offered by our competitors or do not effectively market and sell our platform, our ability to grow our business and sell our products and services may be adversely affected. In addition, acquisitions of our partners by our competitors could result in a decrease in the number of our current and potential customers, as our partners may no longer facilitate the adoption of our platform by potential customers.
We are highly dependent upon our relationship with the developer platforms, web browsers and operating systems provided by third-party technology companies such as Apple and Google. Changes to mobile device operating systems may diminish the usefulness of marketing providers or require significant modifications or demands on our business to continue 
31
Table

supporting those operating systems. Changes to developer platform policies related to third-party software, such as Apple or Google, creating restrictions that limit the ability of our existing or potential customers to use software development kits or that further limit the use of cookies could similarly adversely affect our business.
If we are unsuccessful in establishing or maintaining our relationships with third parties, our ability to compete in the marketplace or to grow our revenue could be impaired and our business, financial condition and results of operations may suffer. Even if we are successful, it is not assured that these relationships will result in increased customer usage of our platform or increased revenue.
Risks Related to Privacy, Data Security and Data Protection Laws
We are subject to stringent and changing laws, regulations, rules, industry standards and contractual obligations related to privacy, data security and data protection. The restrictions and costs imposed by these requirements and our actual or perceived failure to comply with them, could harm our business.
Operating our business and platform involves the collection, use, storage, transfer, sharing and other processing of sensitive, proprietary, confidential, regulated and personal data, including such information that we handle on behalf of our customers. These activities subject us to numerous privacy, data security and data protection obligations, such as various laws, regulations, rules, guidance, industry standards, external and internal policies, contracts, and other obligations that govern the processing of personal data by us and on our behalf.
In the United States, federal, state, and local governments have enacted numerous privacy, data security and data protection laws, including data breach notification laws, personal data privacy laws, and consumer protection laws. For example, the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, imposes specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Federal laws also limit the processing of personal data of children under 13. Violations of these laws can lead to statutory penalties (up to $46,515 per violation in the case of the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, for example). If a private plaintiff or regulator alleges that our privacy, data security or data protection policies and practices are either unfair or deceptive, we may be subject to litigation or regulatory enforcement. In the United States, there are federal and state laws that prohibit unfair and deceptive acts and practices, with federal enforcement typically arising out of Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, or FTC Act. State analogs to the FTC Act, such as the California Unfair Competition Law, often allow for a private right of action as well.
Similarly, the California Consumer Privacy Act (as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act), or the CCPA, imposes privacy, data security and data protection obligations on businesses to which it applies. These obligations include, but are not limited to, providing specific disclosures in privacy notices and affording California residents certain rights related to their personal data. The CCPA allows for statutory fines for noncompliance (up to $7,500 per violation) and provides a private right of action for certain data breaches. Numerous other states also have enacted, or are considering enacting, comprehensive data privacy laws. If we become subject to further new privacy, data security or data protection laws at the state level, the risk of enforcement action against us could increase because we may become subject to additional obligations, and the number of individuals or entities that can initiate actions against us may increase (including individuals, via a private right of action, and state actors).
Outside of the United States, an increasing number of laws, regulations, rules and industry standards apply with respect to privacy, data security and data protection. For example, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation, or the EU GDPR, and the version thereof implemented into the laws of the United Kingdom, or the U.K. GDPR, impose strict requirements with respect to processing the personal data of individuals located within the European Economic Area, or the EEA, and the United Kingdom, or the U.K., respectively. While the EU GDPR and the U.K. GDPR remain substantially similar for the time being, the U.K. government has announced that it will seek to chart its own path on data protection and reform its relevant laws, including in ways that may differ from the EU GDPR. While these developments increase uncertainty with regard to data protection regulation in the U.K., even in their current, substantially similar form, the EU GDPR and U.K. GDPR can expose businesses to divergent parallel regimes that may be subject to different interpretations and enforcement actions for certain violations and related uncertainty. Under the EU GDPR, government regulators may impose temporary or definitive bans on data processing, as well as fines of up to 20 million euros or 4% of annual global revenue, whichever is greater (and the U.K. GDPR currently imposes comparable penalties). Furthermore, because both regimes allow for private rights of action, individuals in the EEA and the U.K. may initiate litigation related to our processing of their personal data. 
In addition, many jurisdictions have enacted data localization laws and cross-border personal data transfer laws. These laws may make it more difficult for us to transfer personal data across jurisdictions, which could impede our business. For example, legal developments in the EEA have created complexity and uncertainty regarding processing and transfers of personal data from the EEA to the United States and other countries outside the EEA. Similar complexities and uncertainties 
32
Table 
of Contents
also apply to transfers from the U.K. to third countries. For example, the EU, U.K. and Switzerland have agreed to a ‘Data Privacy Framework’ for transfers of personal data from Europe to the U.S which we rely on. For the time being, this provides a valid mechanism for the international transfer of personal data. Privacy activists have challenged, and are expected to continue to challenge, the adequacy of this transfer mechanism, and therefore we cannot guarantee that such mechanism will remain available to us indefinitely. While we have taken additional steps to mitigate the impact on us, such as implementing the European Commission’s updated standard contractual clauses, or the SCCs, and the U.K.’s international Data Transfer Agreement (or the U.K.’s international data transfer addendum that can be used with the SCCs), the validity of relying on the SCCs as a transfer mechanism has been, and is expected to continue to be, the subject of further litigation in the EU. Likewise, the validity of relying on the Data Privacy Framework to transfer data to the U.S. is vulnerable to litigation or regulatory action.
In addition to EU and U.K. restrictions on cross-border transfers of personal data, other jurisdictions have enacted or are considering similar cross-border personal data transfer laws and data localization laws, any of which could increase the cost and complexity of doing business in those jurisdictions. If we cannot implement a workable, valid compliance mechanism for cross-border transfers of personal data, we may face increased exposure to regulatory actions, substantial fines, and injunctions against processing or transferring personal data from the EEA or elsewhere. The inability to import personal data to the United States could significantly and negatively impact our business operations, including by limiting our ability to offer our full range of services in the EEA and elsewhere, limiting our ability to collaborate with parties that are subject to EU and other privacy, data security and data protection laws or requiring us to increase our personal data processing capabilities in the EEA and elsewhere at significant expense.
We enter into agreements with our customers regarding our collection, use, storage, transfer, sharing and other processing of personal data in relation to the services we provide to them. We also publish public privacy policies and make other public statements about our privacy, data security and data protection practices. Although we endeavor to comply with such agreements, policies and public statements, we may at times fail to do so or may be perceived to have failed to do so, including due to the errors or omissions of our personnel and third-party service providers and vendors. Such failures or perceived failures can subject us to customer lawsuits, termination of customer agreements and governmental enforcement actions. Even if we eventually prevail in any such dispute, resolving them could be expensive and time-consuming to defend and could result in adverse publicity and reputational harm that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our obligations related to privacy, data protection and data security are quickly changing in an increasingly stringent fashion. These obligations may be subject to differing applications and interpretations, which may be inconsistent or in conflict among jurisdictions. Preparing for and complying with these obligations requires us to devote significant resources (including, without limitation, financial and time-related resources). These obligations may necessitate changes to our information technologies, systems and practices and to those of any third parties that process personal data on our behalf. In addition, these obligations may require us to change our business model. Although we endeavor to comply with all applicable privacy, data security and data protection obligations, we may at times fail (or be perceived to have failed) to do so. Moreover, despite our efforts, our personnel or third parties upon whom we rely may fail to comply with such obligations which could impact our compliance posture. If we fail, or are perceived to have failed, to address or comply with privacy, data security and data protection obligations, we could face significant consequences. These consequences may include, but are not limited to, government enforcement actions (e.g., investigations, fines, penalties, audits, inspections, and similar actions), litigation (including class-related claims), additional reporting requirements or oversight, bans on processing personal data and orders to delete or not use personal data. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, or financial condition, including, but not limited to, loss of customers, interruptions or stoppages in our business operations, inability to process personal data or to operate in certain jurisdictions, limited ability to develop or commercialize our products, expenditure of time and resources to defend any claim or action, adverse publicity or revision or restructuring of our operations. 
For more information on the privacy, data security and data protection laws and regulations to which we are or may become subject, see the section titled “Business – Privacy, Data Security and Data Protection” in our Annual Report.
If we or our third-party service providers or vendors experience a security breach or unauthorized third parties otherwise obtain access to our customers’ data, our data or our platform, our solution may be perceived as not being secure, our reputation may be harmed, demand for our platform and products may be reduced and we may incur significant liabilities.
Operating our business and platform involves the collection, storage, transmission and other processing of sensitive, regulated, proprietary and confidential information, including personal data of our customers, their users and our personnel and our customers’ proprietary and confidential information. We may rely upon third parties (such as service providers or vendors) for our data storage and data processing–related activities. We may share or receive sensitive, regulated, proprietary and confidential information, including personal data, with or from third parties. Cyberattacks, malicious internet-based activity, and online and offline fraud are prevalent and continue to increase in frequency and severity. These threats are becoming increasingly difficult to detect, and these threats come from a variety of sources. In addition to traditional computer “hackers,” threat actors, personnel (such as through theft or misuse), sophisticated nation-states, and nation-state-supported actors now 
33
Table 
of Contents
engage in cyberattacks, and nation-state actors may do so for geopolitical reasons and in conjunction with military conflicts and defense activities. We may be subject to a variety of evolving threats, including, but not limited to, social-engineering attacks (including through phishing, vishing and hybrid phishing attacks), malicious code (such as viruses and worms), malware (including as a result of advanced persistent threat intrusions), denial-of-service attacks (such as credential stuffing), personnel misconduct or error by us or third-party service providers or vendors, ransomware attacks, supply-chain attacks, service outages, software bugs, server malfunctions, software or hardware failures, loss of data or other information technology assets, adware, telecommunications failures, earthquakes, fires, floods, and other similar threats. Additionally, our customers have been and may be in the future, targeted by similar cybersecurity threats, and bad actors have accessed, and may in the future, access our platform and services using such customer’s credentials. Accordingly, the failure of our customers to use appropriate cybersecurity technology and practices can result in unauthorized parties obtaining access to our platform and customer data. Ransomware attacks, including those perpetrated by organized criminal threat actors, nation-states, and nation-state-supported actors, are becoming increasingly prevalent and severe and can lead to significant interruptions in our operations, loss of data and income, reputational harm, and diversion of funds. Extortion payments may alleviate the negative impact of a ransomware attack, but we may be unwilling or unable to make such payments due to, for example, applicable laws or regulations prohibiting such payments. Threat actors could also use artificial intelligence technology for malicious purposes, increasing the frequency and complexity of their attacks, e.g., phishing attacks, fraud, social engineering, and other possible malicious uses, such as with writing malware. Code, including code generated by generative artificial intelligence, could potentially be used and deployed that contains undetected vulnerable or malicious components. This could cause widespread deployment of vulnerable code within our systems. Any of the previously identified or similar threats could cause a security incident. We have also implemented a free trial program that may increase the number of users with access to our platform, and some of these users may include malicious actors who may attempt to breach our platform’s security. This may heighten the likelihood of us experiencing a cybersecurity incident. Additionally, the risk of these threats may increase for us and our third-party service providers and vendors due to ongoing international instability. In the past, nation-states have sponsored cyberattacks against private companies in response to U.S. governmental actions or for other strategic purposes. We cannot guarantee that similar actions will not occur in the future. A security incident could result in unauthorized, unlawful, or accidental acquisition, modification, destruction, loss, alteration, encryption, disclosure of, or access to data. A security incident could disrupt our ability (and that of third parties upon whom we rely) to provide our platform.
We may expend significant resources or modify our business activities in an effort to protect against security incidents. Certain data privacy and security obligations require us to implement and maintain specific security measures, industry-standard or reasonable security measures to protect our information technology systems and data. While we have taken steps designed to protect the proprietary, regulated, sensitive, confidential and personal data in our control, our security measures or those of the third parties on which we rely may not be effective against current or future security risks and threats. Moreover, we or our third-party service providers or vendors may be more vulnerable to such attacks in remote work environments, which have increased in recent years and will likely continue into the foreseeable future.
If we, our customers or our third-party service providers or vendors suffer, or are perceived to have suffered, a security breach or other security incident, we may experience adverse consequences. Applicable data privacy and security obligations may require us to notify relevant stakeholders or regulators of security incidents. We may also be required to publicly disclose certain cybersecurity incidents pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted by the SEC. The repercussions of such disclosures can be costly, and the disclosures or the failure to comply with such requirements could lead to adverse consequences. If we, our customers or a third party upon whom we rely, experience a security incident or are perceived to have experienced a security incident, we may experience adverse consequences. These consequences may include, but are not limited to, government enforcement actions (for example, investigations, fines, penalties, audits, and inspections), additional reporting requirements or oversight, restrictions on processing data (including personal data), litigation (including class action claims), indemnification obligations, negative publicity, reputational harm, monetary fund diversions, interruptions in our operations (including availability of data to us and our customers), financial loss and other similar harms. Security incidents and attendant consequences may cause customers to stop using our platform, deter new customers for using our platform and negatively impact our ability to grow and operate our business.
Risks Related to Other Laws and Litigation
Changes in laws and regulations related to the internet or changes in the internet infrastructure itself may diminish the demand for our platform and could have a negative impact on our business.
The future success of our business depends upon the continued use of smart cell phones, other mobile devices and internet-connected devices as primary mediums for commerce, communication and business applications. Government bodies or agencies have in the past adopted, and may in the future adopt, laws or regulations affecting the use of the internet and internet-connected devices and cell phones as commercial mediums. Changes in these laws or regulations could require us to modify our platform in order to comply with these changes. In addition, government agencies or private organizations may begin to impose taxes, fees or other charges for accessing the internet or commerce conducted via the internet. These laws or 
34
Table 
of Contents
charges could limit the growth of internet-related commerce or communications generally, resulting in reductions in the demand for internet-based solutions such as ours.
In addition, the use of the internet as a business tool could be adversely affected due to delays in the development or adoption of new standards and protocols to handle increased demands of internet activity, security, reliability, cost, ease of use, accessibility and quality of service. The performance of the internet and its acceptance as a business tool have been adversely affected by “viruses,” “worms” and similar malicious programs, along with distributed denial-of-service and similar attacks. As a result, the internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of such damage to or attacks on portions of its infrastructure. If the use of the internet is adversely affected by these issues, demand for our platform could suffer.
Any future litigation against us could be costly and time-consuming to defend.
We have in the past, and may continue in the future to, become subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, such as claims brought by our customers in connection with commercial disputes or employment claims made by our current or former employees. Litigation might result in substantial costs and may divert management’s attention and resources, which might seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Insurance might not cover such claims, provide sufficient payments to cover all the costs to resolve one or more of such claims or continue to be available on terms acceptable to us. A claim brought against us that is uninsured or under-insured could result in unanticipated costs, and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.
If we fail to provide services that our customers can use in compliance with regulations and/or industry standards, our revenue and results of operations could be harmed.
Since our customers are able to upload data into our platform, we may be hosting or otherwise processing substantial amounts of personal data. Our cloud platform has completed a SOC 2 Type 2 audit for security, is ISO 27001 certified and is designed to comply, in all material respects, with various HIPAA standards. Governments and industry organizations may also adopt new laws, regulations, rules, certifications, requirements or standards, or make changes to existing laws, regulations, rules, requirements or standards, that could impact the demand for, or value of, our platform. If we fail to maintain our current security certifications and/or to continue to meet security standards, or if we are unable to adapt our platform to changing legal and regulatory standards or other requirements in a timely manner, our customers may lose confidence in our platform, and our revenue, business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
We are subject to anti-corruption, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering and similar laws, and non-compliance with such laws can subject us to criminal or civil liability and harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We are subject to the FCPA, the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. § 201, the U.S. Travel Act, the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010, the U.K. Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 and other anti-corruption laws in countries in which we conduct activities. Anti-corruption laws are interpreted broadly and prohibit our company from authorizing, offering or providing, directly or indirectly, improper payments or benefits to recipients in the public or private sector. We use third-party law firms, accountants and other representatives for regulatory compliance, sales and other purposes in several countries. We can be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these third-party representatives, our employees, contractors, partners and other agents, even if we do not explicitly authorize such activities. In addition, although we have implemented policies and procedures to ensure compliance with anti-corruption laws, our employees, representatives, contractors, partners and agents may not comply with these laws at all times.
Noncompliance with these laws could subject us to whistleblower complaints, investigations, sanctions, settlements, prosecution, other enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits, significant fines, damages, other civil and criminal penalties or injunctions, suspension and/or debarment from contracting with certain persons, the loss of export privileges, reputational harm, adverse media coverage and other collateral consequences. If any subpoenas or investigations are launched, or governmental or other sanctions are imposed, or if we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal litigation, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed. In addition, responding to any action will likely result in a materially significant diversion of management’s attention and resources and significant defense costs and other professional fees. Enforcement actions and sanctions could further harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Moreover, as an issuer of securities, we also are subject to the accounting and internal controls provisions of the FCPA. These provisions require us to maintain accurate books and records and a system of internal controls sufficient to detect and prevent corrupt conduct. Failure to abide by these provisions may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
We are subject to governmental export and import controls that could impair our ability to compete in international markets and subject us to liability if we violate the controls.
35
Table 
of Contents
Our platform is subject to U.S. export controls, including the Export Administration Regulations and economic sanctions administered by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control. We incorporate encryption technology into our platform. These encryption products and the underlying technology are currently considered “publicly available” by the Export Administration Regulations and may be exported outside of the United States. However, if they cease to be considered “publicly available,” then these encryption products and underlying technology may be exported outside of the United States only with the required export authorizations, including by license, a license exception or other appropriate government authorizations.
Furthermore, our activities are subject to U.S. economic sanctions laws and regulations that prohibit the shipment of certain products and services to countries, governments and persons targeted by U.S. embargoes or sanctions. Obtaining the necessary export license or other authorization for a particular sale may be time consuming and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities even if the export license ultimately may be granted. While we take precautions to prevent our platform from being exported in violation of these laws, including obtaining authorizations for our platform and performing geolocation IP blocking and screenings against United States and other lists of restricted and prohibited persons, we cannot guarantee that the precautions we take will prevent violations of export control and sanctions laws. Additionally, U.S. embargoes and sanctions can change rapidly and unpredictably in response to international events, such as the application of new and broad sanctions against Russia and Belarus in connection with the invasion of Ukraine. Future embargoes or sanctions could have a significant impact on our business or the business of our customers, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and operations. Violations of U.S. sanctions or export control laws can result in incarceration for responsible employees and managers or the imposition of significant fines or penalties.
If our partners fail to obtain appropriate import, export or re-export licenses or permits, we may also be adversely affected through reputational harm as well as other negative consequences, including government investigations and penalties. We presently incorporate export control compliance requirements into our strategic partner agreements, however, our partners may not comply with such requirements.
Various countries regulate the import and export of certain encryption and other technology, including import and export licensing requirements. Some countries have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our platform or could limit our customers’ ability to implement our platform in those countries. Changes in our platform or future changes in export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction of our platform in international markets, prevent our customers with international operations from launching our platform globally or, in some cases, prevent the export or import of our platform to certain countries, governments or persons altogether. Various governmental agencies have proposed additional regulation of encryption technology, including the escrow and government recovery of private encryption keys. Any change in export or import regulations, economic sanctions or related legislation, or change in the countries, governments, persons or technologies targeted by such regulations, could limit our ability to export or sell our platform to existing or potential customers with international operations. Any decreased use of our platform or limitation on our ability to export or sell our platform would adversely affect our business, results of operations and prospects.
Our international operations may subject us to potential adverse tax consequences.
We are expanding our international operations and staff to better support our growth into international markets. Our corporate structure and associated transfer pricing policies contemplate future growth into the international markets, and consider the functions, risks and assets of the various entities involved in the intercompany transactions. The amount of taxes we pay in different jurisdictions may depend on (1) the application of the tax laws of the various jurisdictions, including the United States, to our international business activities, (2) changes in tax rates, (3) new or revised tax laws or interpretations of existing tax laws and policies and (4) our ability to operate our business in a manner consistent with our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements. Taxing authorities may challenge the pricing methodologies of our intercompany arrangements or disagree with our determinations as to the income and expenses attributable to specific jurisdictions. If such a challenge or disagreement were to occur and our position were not sustained, we could be required to pay additional taxes, interest and penalties. This could result in one-time tax charges, higher effective tax rates, reduced cash flows and lower overall profitability of our operations. Our financial statements could fail to reflect adequate reserves to cover such a contingency.
Our ability to use our net operating losses to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.
As of January 31, 2025, we had net operating loss, or NOL, carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of approximately $392.3 million and $284.2 million, respectively, some of which may be available to offset taxable income in the future, and which expire in various years beginning in 2035 for federal purposes and 2026 for state purposes if not utilized. Under current law, U.S. federal NOLs incurred in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, may be carried forward indefinitely, but the deductibility of federal NOLs is limited to 80% of taxable income in tax years beginning after December 31, 2020. Accordingly, $352.9 million of our NOLs may be carried forward indefinitely for federal tax purposes and various states have enacted tax policies or rules that conform to federal tax laws. A lack of future taxable income would adversely affect our ability to utilize NOLs incurred in tax years beginning on or before December 31, 2017, before they expire. In general, 
36

under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, the IRC or the Code, a corporation that undergoes an “ownership change” (which generally is defined under Section 382 of the Code and applicable Treasury Regulations as a greater than 50% change, by value, in its equity ownership over a three-year period) is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change NOLs to offset future taxable income. We have experienced ownership changes in the past and we may experience a future ownership change under Section 382 of the Code that could affect our ability to utilize the NOLs to offset our income, some of which may be outside of our control. Furthermore, our ability to utilize NOLs of companies that we have acquired or may acquire in the future may be subject to limitations. There is also a risk that due to regulatory changes, such as suspensions on the use of NOLs or other unforeseen reasons, our existing NOLs could expire or otherwise be unavailable to reduce future income tax liabilities, including for state tax purposes. For these reasons, we may not be able to utilize a material portion of the NOLs reflected on our balance sheets, even if we attain profitability, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Changes in our effective tax rate or tax liability may have an adverse effect on our results of operations.
Our effective tax rate could increase due to several factors, including:
•
changes in the relative amounts of income before taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we operate that have differing statutory tax rates;
•
expansion to new jurisdictions;
•
changes in tax laws, tax treaties and regulations or the interpretation of them;
•
changes in our assessment of our ability to realize our deferred tax assets that are based on estimates of our future results, the advisability and feasibility of possible tax planning strategies and the economic and political environments in which we do business;
•
the outcome of future tax audits, examinations or administrative appeals; and
•
limitations or adverse findings regarding our ability to do business in some jurisdictions.
Any of these developments could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We could be required to collect additional sales taxes or be subject to other tax liabilities that may increase the costs our customers would have to pay for our products and adversely affect our results of operations.
An increasing number of states have considered or adopted laws that attempt to impose tax collection obligations on out-of-state companies. Additionally, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in 2018 in 
South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc. et al
, or Wayfair, that online sellers can be required to collect sales and use tax despite not having a physical presence in the buyer’s state. In response to Wayfair, or otherwise, state or local governments have adopted and may continue to adopt, or begin to enforce, laws requiring us to calculate, collect and remit taxes on sales in their jurisdictions. In addition, we are subject to indirect taxes in foreign jurisdictions, such as value-added tax and goods and services tax, in connection with certain foreign sales transactions. A successful assertion by one or more tax authorities requiring us to collect taxes where we presently do not do so, or to collect more taxes in a jurisdiction in which we currently do collect some taxes, could result in substantial tax liabilities, including taxes on past sales, as well as penalties and interest that we otherwise have not accounted for in our financial statements. The imposition by tax authorities of indirect tax collection obligations on out-of-jurisdiction sellers also could create additional administrative burdens for us, put us at a competitive disadvantage if similar obligations are not imposed on our competitors and decrease our future sales, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Risks Related to Intellectual Property
We employ third-party licensed software for use in or with our platform, and the inability to maintain these licenses or errors or vulnerabilities in the software we license could result in increased costs, or reduced service levels, which would adversely affect our business.
Our platform incorporates certain third-party software obtained under licenses from third parties. We anticipate that we will continue to rely on such third-party software and development tools from third parties in the future. Although we believe that there are commercially reasonable alternatives to the third-party software we currently license, including open-source software, this may not always be the case, or it may be difficult or costly to migrate to other third-party software. Our use of additional or alternative third-party software may require us to enter into new license agreements with third parties, which may not be available on as favorable terms as our current licenses. In addition, integration of the third-party software used in our software with new third-party software may require significant work and require substantial investment of our time and resources, or require downtime affecting our service level commitments. Also, any undetected errors, defects or security vulnerabilities in third-party software could prevent the deployment or impair the functionality of our software, delay new updates or enhancements to our platform, result in a failure of our platform and injure our reputation.

We use open-source software in our products, which could negatively affect our ability to sell our services or subject us to litigation or other actions.
We use open-source software in our products, and we expect to continue to incorporate open-source software in our services in the future. Few of the licenses applicable to open-source software have been interpreted by courts, and there is a risk that these licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products or to maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary source code. Moreover, we may encounter instances in which we have incorporated additional open-source software in our proprietary software in a manner that is inconsistent with the terms of the applicable license or our current policies and procedures. While we have adopted guidelines for the appropriate use of, and regularly audit our use of, open-source software, these measures may not always be effective. If we were to combine or link our proprietary software products with open-source software in a certain manner, we could, under certain open-source licenses, be required to release the source code of our proprietary software products and allow others to use it at no cost. If an author or other third party that distributes such open-source software were to allege that we had not complied with the conditions of one or more of these licenses, we could be required to incur significant legal expenses defending against such allegations and could be subject to significant damages, enjoined from the sale of our products that contained the open-source software and required to comply with onerous conditions or restrictions on these products, which could disrupt the distribution and sale of these products or put our proprietary source code at risk.
From time to time, there have been claims challenging the ownership rights in open-source software against companies that incorporate it into their products and the licensors of such open-source software provide no warranties or indemnities with respect to such claims. As a result, we and our customers could be subject to lawsuits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open-source software. Litigation could be costly for us to defend, have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, or require us to devote additional research and development resources to change our products. Some open-source projects have known vulnerabilities and architectural instabilities and are provided on an “as-is” basis which, if not properly addressed, could negatively affect the performance of our product. If we inappropriately use or incorporate open-source software subject to certain types of open-source licenses that challenge the proprietary nature of our products, we may be required to re-engineer such products, discontinue the sale of such products or take other remedial actions.
Any failure to protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property rights could substantially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our success and ability to compete depend in part on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property. To safeguard these rights, we rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws and contractual protections, all of which provide only limited protection and may not now or in the future provide us with a competitive advantage.
As of January 31, 2025, we owned 26 granted patents related to our platform and its technology and four patent applications pending for examination in the United States and no non-U.S. patents or patent applications pending. Our patent applications may not result in the issuance of a patent, or the examination process may require us to narrow our claims. Any patents that issue from any patent applications may not give us the protection that we seek or may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. Any patents that may issue in the future from our pending or future patent applications may not provide sufficiently broad protection and may not be valid and enforceable in actions against alleged infringers or provide us with a competitive advantage. Any patents we have obtained or may obtain in the future may be found to be invalid or unenforceable in light of recent and future changes in the law, or because of technology developed prior to the inventions we have sought to patent or because of defects in our patent prosecution process. The United States Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO, and various foreign governmental patent agencies also require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process and after a patent has issued. There are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction.
We have registered the “Braze” name, logo, and/or other marks as trademarks in Australia, Canada, the EU, Indonesia, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore, Tonga, the United Kingdom, and the United States. However, any pending or future trademark applications may not be approved, and any registered trademarks may not be enforceable or provide adequate protection of our proprietary rights. The USPTO and various foreign trademark offices also require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the trademark registration process and after a registration has issued. There are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or cancellation of a trademark filing, resulting in partial or complete loss of trademark rights in the relevant jurisdiction. If this occurs, our competitors might be able to enter the market under identical or similar brands or we may be forced to abandon marks that we currently rely on.
In order to protect our proprietary technologies and processes, we also rely on trade secret laws and confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, strategic partners, vendors and others. Also, despite our efforts to protect our proprietary technology and trade secrets, unauthorized parties may attempt to misappropriate, copy, 
38
Table 
of Contents
reverse engineer or otherwise obtain and use them. In addition, others may independently discover our trade secrets. Further, the contractual provisions that we enter into may not prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of our proprietary technology or intellectual property rights and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our proprietary technology or intellectual property rights. Moreover, policing unauthorized use of our technologies, trade secrets and intellectual property is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, particularly in countries where the laws may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the United States and where mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be weak. For instance, in response to U.S. sanctions, the Russian government has adopted a decree which allows local companies and individuals to use inventions, utility models and industrial designs held by owners from “unfriendly countries” without the owner’s consent and without paying any compensation. If similar policies or laws are adopted in other jurisdictions, it may be difficult for us to enforce our intellectual property rights internationally and subject us to material risk of unauthorized use of our technologies, trade secrets and intellectual property. As we expand our activities outside of the United States, our exposure to unauthorized copying and use of our platform and proprietary information may increase. We may be unable to determine the extent of any unauthorized use or infringement of our platform, technologies or intellectual property rights.
The steps that we take may not be adequate to protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property, others may develop or patent similar or superior technologies, products or services, or our trademarks, patents and other intellectual property may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by others. Furthermore, effective trademark, patent, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available or commercially feasible in every country in which our software is available or where we have employees or independent contractors.
In order to protect our intellectual property rights, we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect these rights. Litigation brought to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly, time-consuming and distracting to management. Furthermore, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights. Our failure to secure, protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could materially adversely affect our brand and business. An adverse determination of any litigation proceedings could put our intellectual property at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and could put our related patents, patent applications and trademark filings at risk of not issuing or being cancelled. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, some of our confidential or sensitive information could be compromised by disclosure in the event of litigation. Our inability to protect our proprietary technology against unauthorized copying or use, as well as any costly litigation or diversion of our management’s attention and resources, could delay further sales or the implementation of our platform, impair the functionality of our platform, delay introductions of new functionality to our platform, result in our substituting inferior or more costly technologies into our platform or injure our reputation. We will not be able to protect our intellectual property if we are unable to enforce our rights or if we do not detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property. If we fail to meaningfully protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
We may be subject to intellectual property rights claims by third parties, which are extremely costly to defend, could require us to pay significant damages and could limit our ability to use certain technologies.
We cannot guarantee that the operation of our business does not infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties. Companies in the software and technology industries, including some of our current and potential competitors, own significant numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. In addition, many of these companies have the capability to dedicate substantially greater resources to enforce their intellectual property rights and to defend claims that may be brought against them. Further, patent litigation may involve patent holding companies, commonly known as patent “trolls,” or other adverse patent owners that have no relevant product revenue and against which our patents may therefore provide little or no deterrence. In the past, we have been subject to allegations of patent infringement that were unsuccessful, and we may in the future be subject to claims that we have misappropriated, misused, or infringed other parties’ intellectual property rights, and, to the extent we gain greater market visibility or face increasing competition, we face a higher risk of being the subject of intellectual property infringement claims, which is not uncommon with respect to enterprise software companies. In addition, we may in the future be subject to claims that employees or contractors, or we, have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of our competitors or other parties. Because patent applications can take years to issue and are often afforded confidentiality for some period of time, there may currently be pending applications, unknown to us, that later result in issued patents that could cover one or more of our products. To the extent that intellectual property claims are made against our customers based on their usage of our technology, we have certain obligations to indemnify and defend such customers from those claims. The term of our contractual indemnity provisions often survives termination or expiration of the applicable agreement. Large indemnity payments, defense costs or damage claims from contractual breach could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
39
Table

Any intellectual property claims, with or without merit, could be very time-consuming, could be expensive to settle or litigate, could divert our management’s attention and other resources and could result in adverse publicity. These claims could also subject us to making substantial payments for legal fees, settlement payments and other costs or damages, potentially including treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed patents or copyrights. Intellectual property claims could also result in our having to stop making, selling, offering for sale or using technology found to be in violation of a third party’s rights. We might be required to seek a license for the third-party intellectual property rights, which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all. Even if a license is available to us, we may be required to pay significant upfront fees, milestone payments or royalties, which would increase our operating expenses. Moreover, to the extent we only have a license to any intellectual property used in our platform, there may be no guarantee of continued access to such intellectual property, including on reasonable terms. As a result, we may be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology, which could require significant effort and expense. If a third party is able to obtain an injunction preventing us from accessing such third-party intellectual property rights, or if we cannot license or develop technology for any infringing aspect of our business, we would be forced to limit or stop sales of our products or cease business activities covered by such intellectual property and may be unable to compete effectively. Any of these results would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We could face liability, or our reputation might be harmed, as a result of the activities of our customers, the content sent through our platform or the data they store on our servers.
As a provider of cloud-based solutions, we may be subject to potential liability for the activities of our customers on or in connection with the content or data they store on or send through our servers. Although our customer terms of use and our acceptable use policy, or AUP, prohibit (1) illegal use of our services by our customers, (2) the use of our services for certain activities that do not comply with industry standards and guidelines outlined in our AUP, or (3) the use of our services in any manner that would infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of third parties, customers may nonetheless engage in prohibited activities or upload or store content with us in violation of our agreement, our AUP, applicable law or the customer’s own policies, which could subject us to liability and/or harm our reputation.
We do not typically monitor the content, activities or messages of our customers in connection with their use of our services, so inappropriate content may be sent to third parties, which could subject us to legal liability. Even if we comply with legal obligations to remove or disable certain content, our customers may continue to send messages through our platform that third parties may find hostile, offensive or inappropriate. The activities of our customers or the content of our customers’ messages may lead us to experience adverse political, business and reputational consequences, especially if such use is high profile. For instance, if our customers use our platform in violation of law it may subject us to increased regulatory scrutiny or direct financial penalties, either of which may have an adverse effect on our reputation and financial results, even if we have complied with our legal obligations. Conversely, actions we take in response to the activities of our customers or users, up to and including suspending their use of our products or services, may harm our brand and reputation.
There are certain statutory and common law frameworks and doctrines that offer defenses against liability for customer activities, including the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, the Communications Decency Act and the fair use doctrine in the United States and the Electronic Commerce Directive in the European Union. Although these and other statutes and case law in the United States offer certain defenses against liability from customer activities under U.S. copyright law or regarding secondary liability from the Telephone Consumer Protection Act or the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act, they are subject to uncertain or evolving judicial interpretation and regulatory and legislative amendments, and in any event we cannot assure you that we will be successful in asserting them. In addition, pending or recently adopted legislation in the European Union may impose additional obligations or liability on us associated with content uploaded by users to our platform. Laws governing these activities are unsettled in many international jurisdictions, or may prove difficult or impossible for us to comply with in some international jurisdictions. Even if ultimately resolved in our favor, we may become involved in related complaints, lawsuits or investigations which add cost to our doing business and may divert management’s time and attention or otherwise harm our reputation.
Our use of artificial intelligence, or AI, and machine learning in our platform and our business, as well as our potential failure to effectively implement, use, and market these technologies, may result in reputational harm or liability, or could otherwise adversely affect our business.
We have incorporated and may continue to incorporate AI and machine learning solutions and features, including generative AI solutions and features, into our platform, and otherwise within our business, and these solutions and features may become more important to our operations or to our future growth over time. There can be no assurance that the use of AI and machine learning solutions and features will enhance our products or services, produce the intended results, or be beneficial to our business, including our efficiency or profitability, and we may fail to properly implement or market our AI and machine learning solutions and features. Our competitors or other third parties may incorporate AI and machine learning tools into their products, offerings, and solutions more quickly or more successfully than we do, which could impair our ability to compete effectively, and adversely affect our results of operations. 
40
Table 
of Contents
Additionally, our AI and machine learning solutions and features may expose us to additional claims, demands, and proceedings by private parties and regulatory authorities and subject us to legal liability as well as brand and reputational harm. There are significant risks involved in utilizing AI and machine learning technologies, and in particular, generative AI technologies. For example, AI and machine learning algorithms may be flawed, insufficient, or of poor quality, reflect unwanted forms of bias, or contain other errors or inadequacies, any of which may not easily be detectable. AI and machine learning technologies have also been known to produce false or “hallucinatory” inferences or outputs. Further, inappropriate or controversial data practices by developers and end-users, or other factors adversely affecting public opinion regarding the use of AI and machine learning, could impair the acceptance of AI and machine learning solutions, including those incorporated into our products and services. If the AI and machine learning tools incorporated into our platform, or the content generated by such tools, is harmful, biased, inaccurate, discriminatory or controversial, we could suffer operational efficiencies in addition to legal, competitive and reputational harm, and our customers may be less likely to utilize our AI and machine learning tools or may cease using our platform altogether. If we do not have sufficient rights to use the output of such AI and machine learning tools, or the data or other material or content on which the AI and machine learning tools we use rely, we also may incur liability through the violation of applicable laws and regulations, third-party intellectual property, privacy or other rights, or contracts to which we are a party.
In addition, we are subject to the risks of new or enhanced governmental or regulatory scrutiny, litigation, or other legal liability, ethical concerns, negative consumer perceptions as to automation and AI and machine learning technologies, any of which could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results. The technologies underlying AI and machine learning and their uses are subject to a variety of laws and regulations related to online services, intermediary liability, intellectual property rights, privacy, data security and data protection, consumer protection, competition and equal opportunity laws, and are expected to be subject to increased regulation and new laws or new applications of existing laws and regulations. AI and machine learning technologies are the subject of ongoing review by various federal, state and foreign governments and regulators, which are applying, or are considering applying, their platform moderation, privacy, data security and data protection laws and regulations to such technologies. Additionally, various federal, state and foreign governments and regulators have implemented, or are considering implementing, general legal and regulatory frameworks for the appropriate use of AI and machine learning, such as the EU AI Act which entered into force on August 1, 2024. As the legal, regulatory, and policy environments around AI and machine learning evolve, we may become subject to new legal and regulatory obligations in connection with our use of AI and machine learning technology, which could require us to make significant changes to our policies and practices, necessitating expenditure of significant time, expense, and other resources. We may not be able to anticipate how to respond to rapidly evolving legal and regulatory frameworks, and we may have to expend resources to adjust our offerings in certain jurisdictions if the legal and regulatory frameworks on AI and machine learning products are not consistent across jurisdictions. Accordingly, it is not possible to predict all of the risks related to the use of AI and machine learning solutions that we may face, and changes in laws, rules, directives, and regulations governing the use of AI and machine learning solutions may adversely affect our ability to use or sell these solutions or subject us to legal liability.
Risks Related to Socioeconomic Factors
Our future revenue and results of operations could be harmed if the increases in demand we have seen from certain industries as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic fail to continue over the long term.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, governments previously instituted shelter-in-place orders, social distancing requirements, travel restrictions and similar measures to slow infection rates. These restrictions prompted shifts from physical commerce to e-commerce, from in-room dining to take out and delivery, from gyms to at home health and fitness and from the theaters to in-home media streaming services. Despite our penetration in these industries that benefited from increased demand during the COVID-19 pandemic, this trend may not continue over the long term. Some of our customers have experienced, and may continue to experience, decreases or decreased growth rates in transactions, which would negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may also continue to experience decreases or decreased growth rates in sales of new subscriptions to some of our customers, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Natural catastrophic events and human-made problems such as climate change, power disruptions, computer viruses, global pandemics, data security breaches and terrorism may disrupt our business.
We rely heavily on our network infrastructure and information technology systems for our business operations. An online attack, damage as a result of civil unrest, earthquake, fire, terrorist attack, power loss, global pandemics, telecommunications failures, climate change-related events or other similar catastrophic event could cause system interruptions, delays in accessing our service, reputational harm and loss of critical data. Such events could prevent us from providing our platform and products to our customers. A catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of our data centers, or our network infrastructure, or information technology systems, including any errors, defects, or failures in third-party hardware, 
41
Table 
of Contents
could affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, many companies that provide cloud-based services have reported a significant increase in cyberattack activity in recent years. Further, events outside of our control, including natural disasters, climate change-related events, pandemics or health crises may arise from time to time and be accompanied by governmental actions. Any such events and responses, including regulatory developments, may cause significant volatility and declines in the global markets, disproportionate impacts to certain industries or sectors, disruptions to commerce (including to economic activity, travel and supply chains), loss of life and property damage, and may materially and adversely affect the global economy or capital markets, as well as our business and results of operations.
Risks Related to Public Company Reporting and Public Disclosure Practices
We have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting associated with certain Information Technology General Controls ("ITGCs"). If we are unable to remediate this, or otherwise fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements could be impaired, which could adversely affect our operating results, our ability to operate our business, our stock price and access to the capital markets.
We are required, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting on an annual basis. Accordingly, we are required to establish and periodically evaluate and assess procedures with respect to our internal control over financial reporting. In connection with our year-end assessment as part of this Annual Report, we determined that, as of January 31, 2025, we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting due to a material weakness identified in the operation of certain ITGCs relevant to our key accounting, reporting, and proprietary information technology systems, as more fully described in the section entitled "
Controls and Procedures
" in Item 9A of Part II of this Annual Report Form 10-K. The material weakness did not result in any identified misstatements to the financial statements, and there were no changes to previously issued financial results. However, if we are unable to remediate this matter we cannot guarantee this will be the case in future periods.
While we are in the process of implementing changes to remediate the material weakness identified, we cannot be certain as to when remediation will be complete or if the remediation efforts will be successful. Further, remediation efforts may place a significant burden on management and add increased pressure to our financial and information technology resources and processes. As a result, we may not be successful in making the improvements necessary to remediate the material weakness identified by management in a timely manner or in identifying and remediating additional control deficiencies, including material weaknesses, in the future. Any failure to remediate the material weakness identified, or the development of new material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, could severely inhibit our ability to accurately report our financial condition or results of operations. We could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our Class A common stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities. Failure to remedy the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or the implement or maintain other effective control systems required of public companies, could harm our results of operations or cause us to fail to meet our future reporting obligations. 
We are subject to risks related to our environmental, social, and governance practices and disclosures.
ESG matters have been a focus of regulators, certain investors and other stakeholders, both in the United States and internationally. Often those stakeholders have differing, and sometimes conflicting, priorities or requirements regarding ESG matters. The heightened and sometimes conflicting stakeholder focus on ESG issues related to our business requires the continuous monitoring of various and evolving laws, regulations, standards and expectations and the associated reporting requirements. Our interpretation or application of such reporting requirements may change over time or differ from other similarly situated companies. Certain organizations also provide ESG ratings, scores and benchmarking studies that assess companies’ ESG practices. Although there are no universal standards for such ratings, scores or benchmarking studies, they are used by some investors to inform their investment and voting decisions. It is possible that our future shareholders or organizations that report on, rate or score ESG practices will not be satisfied with our ESG strategy or performance. Unfavorable or inaccurate press about ratings or assessments of our ESG strategies or practices, regardless of whether or not we comply with applicable legal requirements, may lead to adverse investor sentiment toward us, which in turn could have an adverse impact on our share price, demand for our securities and our access to, and cost of, capital.
In addition, any of our current or future social impact practices and initiatives could be difficult to achieve and costly to implement. In the event that we publicly disclose, voluntarily or otherwise, certain practices and initiatives regarding ESG matters, we could fail, or be perceived to fail, in our achievement of such practices or initiatives, or we could be criticized for the scope of such practices or initiatives, which could negatively impact our ability to attract or retain employees or customers or reduce the attractiveness of our stock in the investment community. There has also been a recent increase in litigation surrounding ESG practices and related disclosures. There can be no assurance that we will not be subject to allegations or claims associated with our sustainability-related claims or other ESG practices and initiatives.

Risks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock
We do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future and, as a result, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our Class A common stock.
We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our Class A or Class B common stock and we do not intend to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We anticipate that we will retain all of our future earnings for use in the development of our business and for general corporate purposes. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors and governed by the limitations of any credit agreements we may become party to. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their Class A common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investments.
The dual class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting control with our executive officers, directors and significant holders of our capital stock, which limits the ability of holders of our Class A common stock to influence the outcome of important transactions.
Our Class B common stock has ten votes per share and our Class A common stock, which is the stock listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, has one vote per share. As a result, as of January 31, 2025, holders of our Class B common stock collectively beneficially owned, in the aggregate, shares representing approximately 64.6% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock, and our executive officers, directors and holders of 5% or more of our common stock (by voting power) collectively beneficially owned, in the aggregate, outstanding shares representing approximately 69.2% of the total voting power of our outstanding capital stock. As a result, the holders of our Class B common stock, and in particular our executive officers, directors and holders of 5% or more of our common stock (by voting power), will be able to exercise considerable influence over matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or our assets, even if their stock holdings represent less than 50% of the outstanding shares of our capital stock. This concentration of ownership will limit the ability of other stockholders to influence corporate matters and may cause us to make strategic decisions that could involve risks to holders of our Class A common stock or that may not be aligned with the interests of holders of our Class A common stock. This control may adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock.
Further, future transfers by holders of our Class B common stock will generally result in those shares converting into shares of our Class A common stock, subject to limited exceptions, such as certain transfers effected for tax or estate planning purposes. The conversion of shares of our Class B common stock into shares of our Class A common stock will have the effect, over time, of increasing the relative voting power of those holders of Class B common stock who retain their shares in the long term.
We cannot predict the impact our dual class structure may have on the market price of our Class A common stock.
We cannot predict whether our dual class structure, combined with the concentrated control of certain stockholders, including our executive officers, employees and directors, investors and their affiliates, will result in a lower or more volatile market price of our Class A common stock or in adverse publicity or other adverse consequences. For example, certain index providers have announced restrictions on including companies with multiple class share structures in certain of their indexes, and our dual class capital structure may make it more difficult for us, or make us ineligible, to be included in certain stock indexes. Given the sustained flow of investment funds into passive strategies that seek to track certain indexes, exclusion from stock indexes would likely preclude investment by many of these funds and could make our Class A common stock less attractive to other investors. As a result, the market price of our Class A common stock could be adversely affected.
An active public trading market for our Class A common stock may not develop or be sustained.
Prior to the closing of our initial public offering, no public market for our Class A common stock existed. An active public trading market for our Class A common stock may not continue to develop or, if further developed, it may not be sustained. The lack of an active market may impair the ability of holders of our Class A common stock to sell their shares at the time they wish to sell them or at a price that the holders of our Class A common stock consider reasonable. The lack of an active market may also reduce the fair value of shares of our Class A common stock. An inactive market may also impair our ability to raise capital to continue to fund operations by selling shares and may impair our ability to acquire other companies or technologies by using our shares as consideration.
Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of our company more difficult, limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management and limit the market price of our Class A common stock.

Provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, each as currently in effect, may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. Such amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws include provisions that:
•
authorize our board of directors to issue, without further action by the stockholders, shares of undesignated preferred stock with terms, rights and preferences determined by our board of directors that may be senior to our Class A common stock;
•
require that any action to be taken by our stockholders be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting and not by written consent;
•
specify that special meetings of our stockholders can be called only by our board of directors, the chairperson of our board of directors or our chief executive officer;
•
establish an advance notice procedure for stockholder proposals to be brought before an annual meeting, including proposed nominations of persons for election to our board of directors;
•
establish that our board of directors is divided into three classes, with each class serving three-year staggered terms;
•
prohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors;
•
provide that our directors may be removed for cause only upon the vote of at least 66 2/3% of our outstanding shares of voting stock;
•
provide that vacancies on our board of directors may be filled only by a majority of directors then in office, even though less than a quorum; and
•
require the approval of our board of directors or the holders of at least 66 2/3% of our outstanding shares of voting stock to amend our bylaws and certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation.
These provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management. In addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or DGCL, which generally, subject to certain exceptions, prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with any “interested” stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an “interested” stockholder. Any of the foregoing provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our Class A common stock, and they could deter potential acquirers of our company, thereby reducing the likelihood that holders of our Class A common stock would receive a premium for their shares of our Class A common stock in an acquisition.
The provision of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation requiring exclusive venue in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware and the federal district courts of the United States for certain types of lawsuits may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against our directors and officers.
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation as currently in effect provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware be the sole and exclusive forum for:
•
any derivative claim or cause of action brought on our behalf;
•
any claim or cause of action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty;
•
any claim or cause of action against us arising under the DGCL;
•
any claim or cause of action arising under or seeking to interpret our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws; and
•
any claim or cause of action against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine.
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation as currently in effect further provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal district courts of the United States of America shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for the resolutions of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, including all causes of action asserted against any defendant named in such complaint. The exclusive forum clauses described above shall not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. For the avoidance of doubt, this provision is intended to benefit and may be enforced by us, our officers and directors, the underwriters to any offering giving rise to such complaint, and any other professional entity whose profession gives authority to a statement made by that person or entity and who has prepared or certified any part of the documents underlying any offering.
Although we believe these provisions benefit us by providing increased consistency in the application of applicable law in the types of lawsuits to which they apply, the provisions may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against our directors and officers. The enforceability of similar choice of forum provisions in other companies’ certificates of incorporation has been challenged in legal proceedings, and there is uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce such provisions. In addition, investors cannot waive compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. It is possible that, in connection with any applicable action brought against us, a court could find the choice of forum provisions contained in our 
44
Table

currently effective amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in such action. If so, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Future sales of our Class A common stock in the public market could cause the market price of our Class A common stock to decline.
Future sales of a substantial number of shares of our Class A common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales might occur, could depress the market price of our Class A common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. Many of our existing equity holders have substantial unrecognized gains on the value of the equity they hold, and therefore they may take steps to sell their shares or otherwise secure the unrecognized gains on those shares. Additionally, we plan to issue shares of Class A commons stock in our planned acquisition of OfferFit, and have agreed to register the re-sale of these shares. We are unable to predict the effect that such sales may have on the prevailing market price of our Class A common stock.
We have registered all of our common stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding stock options, settlement of outstanding restricted stock units, or RSUs, or otherwise issuable pursuant to the terms of the purchase rights under our employee stock purchase plan or any equity incentives we may grant in the future, for public resale under the Securities Act. Such underlying common stock will become eligible for sale in the public market to the extent such options or purchase rights are exercised or RSUs are settled, subject to compliance with applicable securities laws.
Further, the holders of Class A and Class B common stock issued in connection with the conversion of our previously outstanding convertible preferred stock immediately prior to the completion of our initial public offering have rights, subject to some conditions, to require us to file registration statements covering the sale of their shares or to include their shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or other stockholders.
General Risk Factors
The price of our Class A common stock may be volatile, and you may lose some or all of your investment.
The market price of our Class A common stock may be highly volatile and may fluctuate substantially as a result of a variety of factors. Factors that may affect the market price of our Class A common stock include:
•
actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition and results of operations;
•
variance in our financial performance from expectations of securities analysts;
•
changes in the prices of our products and services;
•
changes in our projected financial condition and results of operations;
•
changes in laws or regulations applicable to the provision of our products and services or changes that may cause us to incur, among other elements, additional or unforeseen expenses associated with regulatory compliance;
•
announcements by us or our competitors of significant business developments, acquisitions or new offerings;
•
security breaches impacting us or similar companies;
•
our involvement in any material litigation;
•
future sales of our Class A common stock by us or our stockholders or our sales of other securities in the future;
•
changes in senior management or key personnel;
•
the trading volume of our Class A common stock;
•
changes in the anticipated future size and growth rate of our market;
•
general economic, regulatory and market conditions; and
•
technical factors in the public trading market for our Class A common stock that may produce price movements that may or may not comport with macro, industry, or company-specific fundamentals, including, without limitation, the sentiment of retail investors, the amount and status of short interest in our securities, access to margin debt, trading in options and other derivatives on our Class A common stock and other technical trading factors.
Accordingly, we cannot assure you of the liquidity of an active trading market, your ability to sell your shares of our Class A common stock when desired, or the prices that you may obtain for your shares of our Class A common stock. The lack of an active market may impair your ability to sell your shares at the time you wish to sell them or at a price that you consider reasonable. The lack of an active market may also reduce the fair value of your shares. An inactive market may also impair our ability to raise capital to continue to fund operations by selling shares and may impair our ability to acquire other companies or technologies by using our shares as consideration.
The stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. Additionally, the recent and acute volatility among certain financial institutions 
45
Table 
of Contents
have raised questions regarding the stability of the banking sector and, while such volatility has not adversely affected our operations, it has had an adverse impact on the equity and credit markets. Broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political, regulatory and market conditions, may negatively impact the market price of our Class A common stock. In the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their securities have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future, which could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention.
Our issuance of additional capital stock in connection with financings, acquisitions, investments, our equity incentive plans or otherwise will dilute all other stockholders.
We expect to issue additional capital stock in the future that will result in dilution to all other stockholders. We expect to grant equity awards to employees, directors and consultants under our equity incentive plans and purchase rights to our employees under our employee stock purchase plan. We may also raise capital through equity financings in the future. As part of our business strategy, we may acquire or make investments in companies, products, services or technologies and issue equity securities to pay for any such acquisition or investment. For instance, we plan to issue shares of Class A common stock as a portion of the consideration in our proposed acquisition of OfferFit. Any such issuances of additional capital stock may cause stockholders to experience significant dilution of their ownership interests and the per share value of our Class A common stock to decline.
If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or publish negative reports about our business, our share price and trading volume could decline.
The trading market for our Class A common stock depends, in part, on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. If our financial performance fails to meet analyst estimates or one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our shares or change their opinion of our shares, our share price would likely decline. Our business results may vary significantly from such analyst estimates or any analyst consensus due to a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control, including due to the global economic uncertainty and financial market conditions, including as a result of global or domestic macroeconomic and socioeconomic conditions such as, among others, instability in the banking and financial services sector, international and domestic supply chain risks, inflationary pressure, interest rate increases, declines in consumer confidence, international conflicts and domestic and foreign political unrest, that impact us and our customers, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our share price or trading volume to decline.
Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments
None.
Item 1C. Cybersecurity
Cybersecurity risk management is an 
integral
 part of our overall enterprise risk management program. We have an enterprise-wide cybersecurity program designed to protect against, detect, respond to and remediate cybersecurity risks and threats. To protect our information systems from cybersecurity threats, we use various security tools that are designed to prevent, identify, escalate, investigate and remediate identified cybersecurity threats and incidents, including threats and incidents associated with third-party service providers, in a timely manner. These tools include, among others, internal detection tools to support the identification, monitoring and reporting of threats, vulnerabilities and incidents, and a bug bounty program to allow security researchers to assist us in identifying vulnerabilities in our platform and products before they are exploited by malicious threat actors. We maintain a variety of incident response plans that are utilized when cybersecurity incidents are detected. We require employees with access to information systems, including specified corporate and engineering employees, to undertake data protection and cybersecurity training. Further, we use various processes to identify, monitor, assess and manage material risks from cybersecurity threats associated with the use of third-party service providers, including engaging in security reviews of third-party service providers who may have access to, or integrate with, our information systems; however, we rely on these third parties to implement cybersecurity programs commensurate with their risk profile and our expectations, and we cannot ensure in all circumstances that their efforts will be successful.
We regularly assess risks from cybersecurity and technology threats and monitor our information systems for potential vulnerabilities. We use a widely-adopted risk quantification model to identify, measure and prioritize cybersecurity and technology risks and develop related security controls and safeguards. We conduct regular reviews and tests of our information security program, including tabletop exercises, penetration and vulnerability testing, simulations, and other exercises to evaluate the effectiveness of our information security program and improve our security measures and planning. 
In addition to our bug bounty program, we also 
engage
 third parties to provide independent penetration testing, to support internal security audits and 
46
Table 
of Contents
to provide external security audits. We also regularly report on the results of our assessments and security testing to our audit committee.
Our management is responsible for identifying, assessing, and managing cybersecurity risks on an ongoing basis by establishing processes to ensure that such potential cybersecurity risk exposures are monitored, putting in place appropriate mitigation and remediation measures, maintaining cybersecurity policies and procedures, and providing regular reports to our board of directors, including through the audit committee of our board directors.
Our chief technology officer
 is responsible for our information security team which oversees and implements our cybersecurity program. 
Our chief technology officer has over a decade of industry experience, and is supported by a team of information security professionals who have relevant educational and industry experience, including holding similar positions at large technology companies.
 Our chief technology officer and information security team provide regular reports to senior management, other relevant teams and the 
audit committee of our board of directors
 on our cybersecurity program, material cybersecurity risks and mitigation strategies, and other cybersecurity developments. In addition to such regular reports, and as part of our incident response processes, our chief technology officer will provide updates on material cybersecurity threats and incidents to our audit committee and, as necessary, to the full board of directors, based on management’s assessment of risk.
Our board of directors has ultimate oversight responsibility for our strategic and business risk management and delegates cybersecurity risk management oversight to its audit committee. Our audit committee receives reports on, generally, a quarterly basis from our chief technology officer on various cybersecurity matters, including risk assessments, mitigation strategies, areas of emerging risks, incidents and industry trends, and other areas of importance. Our audit committee is responsible for overseeing the adequacy and effectiveness of our privacy and information security policies and practices and the internal controls regarding privacy and information security. Our audit committee or chief technology officer, as appropriate, also reports material cybersecurity risks to our full board of directors.
 
While unauthorized persons have attempted to access our information systems in the past, and will likely continue to do so in the future, we have not, to date, identified any cybersecurity incidents that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect us, including our business strategy, results of operations or financial condition.
 However, despite our efforts, we cannot eliminate all risks from cybersecurity threats or incidents, or provide assurances that we have not experienced an undetected cybersecurity incident. For more information on these risks, see “Risk Factors—If we or our third-party service providers or vendors experience a security breach or unauthorized parties otherwise obtain access to our customers’ data, our data or our platform, our solution may be perceived as not being secure, our reputation may be harmed, demand for our platform and products may be reduced and we may incur significant liabilities.”
Item 2. Properties
Our headquarters is located in New York City, where we lease approximately 92,300 square feet pursuant to a lease that expires in January 2034. We also lease additional office space in over 10 cities across North America, South America, Europe, the Asia-Pacific region, and the Middle East. These offices are leased, and we do not own any real property. We believe that our current facilities are generally suitable to meet our needs for the foreseeable future. In addition, to the extent we require additional space in the future, we believe that it would be readily available on commercially reasonable terms.
Item 3. Legal Proceedings
From time to time, we may become involved in various legal proceedings arising from the normal course of business activities. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we are not presently a party to any litigation the outcome of which, we believe, if determined adversely to us, would individually or taken together have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, cash flows or financial condition. Defending such proceedings can be costly and can impose a significant burden on management and employees. The results of any current or future litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, and regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors.
Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures
Not applicable.

Overview
Braze is a leading customer engagement platform that empowers brands to Be Absolutely Engaging. Our platform empowers brands to listen to their customers better, understand them more deeply, and act on that understanding in a way that is human and personal. Using our platform, brands ingest and process customer data in real time, orchestrate and optimize contextually relevant, marketing campaigns across multiple channels. Our platform is designed so that interactions between brands and consumers have the same relevance and cross-channel continuity as human interactions. 
Our customers include many established global enterprises and leading technology innovators, and span a wide variety of sizes and industries, including retail and consumer goods, media and entertainment, telecommunications, restaurants and on-demand services, healthcare and life sciences, technology, manufacturing, education, government and public services, and financial services.
We primarily generate revenue from the sale of subscriptions to customers for the use of our platform. Our subscription fees are principally based on an upfront commitment by our customers for messaging volumes, a specific number of monthly active users, platform access and/or support and certain add-on products. Additionally, we provide professional services, which better enable customers to successfully onboard and use our platform, including certain premium professional services such as email deliverability support and dedicated technical support staff.
We employ a land-and-expand business model centered around offering products that are easy to adopt and have a rapid time to value. We expand our reach within existing customers when our customers add new channels, purchase additional subscription products, implement new engagement strategies, or onboard new business units and geographies. We also grow as our customers grow because our pricing is based in large part on the number of consumers that our customers reach and the volume of messages our customers send. Accordingly, as our customers increase the use of our platform and increase the number of end users reached via our platform, the value of our contracts with such customers also increases.
We have grown significantly in recent periods. We generated revenue of $593.4 million, $471.8 million, and $355.4 million in the fiscal years ended January 31, 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively, representing year-over-year growth of 25.8% from the fiscal years ended January 31, 2024 to January 31, 2025 and 32.7%
 from the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023 to 
January 31, 2024. We had net losses of $104.0 million, $130.4 million and $140.7 million, in the fiscal years ended January 31, 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively. We had net cash provided by operating activities of $36.7 million in the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025. We had net cash provided by operating activities of $6.9 million and net cash used in operating activities of $22.3 million in the fiscal years ended January 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our Non-GAAP free cash flow was $19.6 million, $(6.5) million and $(39.0) million in the fiscal years ended January 31, 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively. See the section titled “— Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow” for additional information about how we calculate free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial metric, and a reconciliation to net cash provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable measure calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or U.S. GAAP.
Factors Affecting Our Performance
Acquiring New Customers
We believe there is substantial opportunity to continue to grow our customer base. We intend to continue to expand our customer base in verticals where we already have a strong presence, such as retail and consumer goods, media and entertainment, telecommunications, restaurants and on-demand services, healthcare and life sciences, technology, manufacturing, education, government and public services, and financial services — and to increase our presence in verticals where we are not yet strongly represented. Through our sales and marketing efforts, we also plan to capitalize on industries subject to ongoing digital transformation and where direct-to-consumer relationships are accelerating, to further propel adoption of our technology. As of January 31, 2025, we had 2,296 customers across a broad range of sizes and industries. Our ability to attract new customers will depend on a number of factors, including the quality and pricing of our products, offerings of our competitors and the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.
We define a customer as the separate and distinct, ultimate parent-level entity that has an active subscription with us to use our products. A single organization could have multiple distinct contracting divisions or subsidiaries, all of which together would be considered a single customer.
Expanding Within Our Existing Customer Base
49
Table 
of Contents
We believe we can achieve significant growth by expanding sales within our existing customer base. We expand the use of our platform by existing customers by, among others, adding new channels and increasing the messaging volume we sell to our customers as their businesses and needs continue to grow and as they connect directly with additional consumers, which in turn leads to a need for greater messaging capacity. We intend to continue to invest in developing and enhancing our products and functionality. Our ability to increase sales to existing customers will depend on a number of factors, including our customers’ satisfaction with our solutions, the ability of our customers to attract new end users, competition, pricing and overall changes in our customers’ spending levels.
Historically, we have experienced significant expansion within a customer’s business once our platform is deployed, with customers typically increasing the number of monthly active users, channels and use cases, as well as purchasing additional products. A monthly active user is an end user of a customer who has engaged with the customer’s applications and websites in the previous thirty-day period. We include each distinguishable end user in our calculation of monthly active users, even though some users may access our customers’ applications and websites using more than one device, and multiple users may gain access using the same device. As of January 31, 2025, we had approximately 7.2 billion monthly active users, up from approximately 6.2 billion monthly active users as of January 31, 2024.
Braze supports interactions across a broad range of both in-product and out-of-product messaging channels. The flexibility of our platform also allows us to add new channels quickly and efficiently as they become relevant to our customers. The breadth of channels we offer, and our ability to efficiently expand our offering of channels, allows us to expand our reach within existing customers as they purchase additional channels from us.
In addition to monthly active users, we have a history of increasing annual recurring revenue, or ARR, from our customers. We define ARR as the annualized value of customer subscription contracts, including certain premium professional services that are subject to contractual subscription terms, as of the measurement date, assuming any contract that expires during the next 12 months is renewed on its existing terms (including contracts for which we are negotiating a renewal). Our calculation of ARR is not adjusted for the impact of any known or projected future events (such as customer cancellations, expansion or contraction of existing customers relationships or price increases or decreases) that may cause any such contract not to be renewed on its existing terms. Our ARR may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including customers’ satisfaction or dissatisfaction with our products and professional services, pricing, competitive offerings, economic conditions or overall changes in our customers’ spending levels. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue and does not represent our GAAP revenue on an annualized basis or a forecast of revenue, as it is an operating metric that can be impacted by contract start and end dates and renewal rates. 
For clarity, we use annualized invoiced amounts per customer subscription contract, including certain premium professional services that are subject to contractual subscription terms, as compared to revenue calculated in accordance with GAAP, to calculate our ARR. Our invoiced amounts are not matched to the performance obligations associated with the underlying subscription contract and premium professional service obligations as they are with respect to our GAAP revenue. This can result in timing differences between our GAAP revenue and ARR calculations. For our revenue calculated in accordance with GAAP, we recognize revenue related to contracts with customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for subscription and professional services. See the section titled “— Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” for additional information regarding how we recognize revenue on a GAAP basis. Investors should not place undue reliance on ARR as an indicator of our future or expected results. Moreover, ARR may differ from similarly titled metrics presented by other companies and may not be comparable to such other metrics.
A further indication of the propensity of our customer relationships to expand over time is our dollar-based net retention rate. We calculate our dollar-based net retention rate as of a period end by starting with the ARR from the cohort of all customers as of 12 months prior to such period-end, or the Prior Period ARR. We then calculate the ARR from these same customers as of the current period-end, or the Current Period ARR. Current Period ARR includes any expansion and is net of contraction or attrition over the last 12 months but excludes ARR from new customers in the current period. We then divide the total Current Period ARR by the total Prior Period ARR to arrive at the point-in-time dollar-based net retention rate. We then calculate the weighted average point-in-time dollar-based net retention rates as of the last day of each month in the current trailing 12-month period to arrive at the dollar-based net retention rate. Our dollar-based net retention rate for the trailing 12 months ended January 31, 2025, 2024, and 2023, was 111%, 117%, and 124% respectively, for all our customers, and 114%, 120%, and 126%, respectively, for our customers with ARR of $500,000 or more. In addition, 247, 202, and 156 of our customers had ARR of $500,000 or more as of January 31, 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively.
Our dollar-based net retention rate is influenced by macroeconomic factors that impact our customers’ purchasing decisions, which may impact the revenue attributable to such customers. The decline in our trailing 12-month dollar-based net retention rate was primarily due to customer turnover and renewals at lower subscription levels. In particular, we have observed that customer renewals in the current uncertain macroeconomic environment and high interest rate climate have led customers to renew their contracts at levels more closely aligned with their current needs, rather than opting for larger commitments based on anticipated future demand.

Expanding Geographically
We believe there is a significant opportunity to continue to expand our presence in international markets we have already penetrated and by entering markets we have not yet penetrated. For the fiscal years ended January 31, 2025, 2024, and 2023, approximately 45%, 43%, and 42%, of our revenue was generated outside of the United States, respectively. We expect to increase market penetration in regions including Europe and Asia-Pacific and to further capitalize on the greenfield opportunity in regions such as Latin America. Although these investments in geographic regions may negatively affect our operating results in the near term, we believe that they will contribute to our long-term growth.
Sustaining Innovation and Technology Leadership
Our success is dependent on our ability to sustain innovation and technology leadership in order to maintain our competitive advantage. We are focused on investing in research and development to continue to enhance our platform. For example, we continue to develop our artificial intelligence capabilities, to enable brands to better analyze and act on customer data, and to expand our channel offerings. We believe our market-driven product development approach maximizes the return on new feature development and channel expansion. Our customers consistently volunteer to participate in the testing of new products, which indicates their appetite for new and innovative functionality. We believe our continued innovation will provide new avenues for growth through which we will continue to deliver differentiated outcomes for our customers. We intend to continue to invest in building additional products that expand our capabilities and facilitate the extension of our platform to new channels and use cases.
Macroeconomic Conditions on Our Business
Unfavorable conditions in the economy, both in the United States and abroad, may negatively affect the growth of our business and our results of operations. General macroeconomic and socioeconomic conditions such as, among others, instability in the banking and financial services sector, international and domestic supply chain risks, inflationary pressure, interest rate increases, declines in consumer confidence, international conflicts and domestic and foreign political unrest have led to increased economic uncertainty. We cannot predict if these trends will continue, and, accordingly, we are not able to estimate the ongoing effects on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity as a result of these macroeconomic factors. For additional details, see the section titled “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Components of Results of Operations
Revenue
Revenue is derived from two primary sources: (1) subscription services and (2) professional services and other.
Subscription services primarily consist of access to our customer engagement platform and related customer support. Our customers enter into a subscription for committed contractual entitlements. To the extent that our customers’ usage exceeds the committed contractual entitlements under their subscription plans, they are charged for excess usage, or they may exercise an option to purchase an incremental volume tier of committed contractual entitlements. Revenue associated with platform subscriptions is recognized ratably over the contract term, which is consistent with the period over which services are provided to the customer. Fees associated with excess usage and incremental volume are also treated as subscription revenue. To date, fees associated with excess usage have not been material.
Professional services and other revenue consists of fees for distinct services rendered in training and assisting our customers to configure our platform for their use at the onset of their initial contract or when a new product is purchased. Such revenue is generally recognized over a period of up to six months from providing access to the platform. We also provide additional platform and feature enhancement and optimization services which are generally recognized ratably over the contract term.
Deferred revenue consists of customer billings in advance of revenue being recognized. We generally invoice our customers for subscription services arrangements annually in advance and for professional services upfront.
Cost of Revenue
Cost of revenue consists of direct costs related to providing platform access to our customers and to performing onboarding and professional services including consulting services. These costs primarily include payments to third-party cloud infrastructure providers for hosting software solutions, costs associated with application service providers utilized to deliver the platform, personnel-related costs, including salaries, cash-based performance compensation, benefits and stock-based

compensation, and overhead cost allocations, including rent, utilities, depreciation, information technology costs, amortization of internal use software and certain administrative personnel costs.
We intend to continue to invest additional resources in our platform infrastructure and our customer support and success organizations to expand the capabilities of our platform. The level, timing and relative investment in our infrastructure could affect our cost of revenue in the future. We expect our cost of revenue to increase for the foreseeable future as we continue to grow our business.
Gross Profit and Gross Margin
Gross profit represents revenue less cost of revenue. Gross margin is gross profit expressed as a percentage of revenue. Our gross margin may fluctuate from period to period as our revenue and cost of revenue fluctuates, including as a result of the timing and amount of resources we dedicate to improving our platform and expanding our products.
Operating Expenses
Our operating expenses consist of sales and marketing, research and development and general and administrative expenses. Personnel costs, including salaries, cash-based performance compensation, benefits and stock-based compensation, are the most significant component of operating expenses. Operating expenses also include allocated overhead costs, which include rent, utilities, depreciation, information technology costs and certain administrative personnel costs. As we continue to expand our operations, we expect an increase in personnel headcount and expansion of our global footprint.
Sales and Marketing
Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for our sales and marketing organization, sales commissions, costs related to brand awareness, sponsorships, customer marketing events and advertising, agency costs, travel-related expenses and allocated overhead costs.
We intend to continue to invest in sales and marketing to help drive the growth of our business. We expect our sales and marketing expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in sales and marketing activities to acquire new customers and increase sales to existing customers.
Research and Development
Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for our engineering, service, design and information technology teams. Additionally, research and development expenses include allocated overhead costs and contractor fees. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Capitalized internal-use software development costs are excluded from research and development expenses as they are capitalized as a component of property and equipment, net and amortized to cost of revenue over the software’s expected useful life, which is generally three years.
We expect to continue our investment in research and development to enhance the user experience of our current customers and attract new customers. We expect research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in enhancing our platform.
General and Administrative
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for finance, legal, human resources and other administrative functions, as well as non-personnel costs such as legal, accounting and other professional service fees, software costs, certain tax, license and insurance-related expenses and allocated overhead costs. Additionally, from time to time general and administrative expenses may include expenses associated with our donation of shares of Class A common stock to a charitable donor-advised fund in connection with our Pledge 1% commitment.
We expect that general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars and vary from period to period as a percentage of revenue for the foreseeable future but decrease as a percentage of revenue over the long term, as we focus on processes, systems, and controls to enable our internal support functions to scale with the growth of our business. We have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, additional expenses as a result of operating as a public company, including expenses to comply with the rules and regulations applicable to companies listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC, expenses related to compliance and reporting obligations pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC, and higher expenses for insurance, investor relations and professional services.
Other Income, Net
52
Table 
of Contents
Other income, net, primarily consists of net exchange gains or losses on foreign currency transactions and investment income consists primarily of income earned on our investments, cash and cash equivalents, and restricted cash.
Provision for Income Taxes
Provision for income taxes consists of state income taxes and income taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business. We maintain a full valuation allowance in jurisdictions where we had net deferred tax assets as we have concluded that it is not more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized.

The increase in revenue of $121.6 million, or 25.8%, for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025 compared to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024 was primarily driven by an $119.2 million, or 26.4%, increase in subscription revenue. Approximately 73.8% of the increase in subscription revenue was attributable to the growth from existing customers increase in monthly active users, expansion across channels and committed entitlements and features, and the remaining 26.2% was attributable to new customers. Total customers grew to 2,296 as of January 31, 2025 from 2,044 as of January 31, 2024. Professional services revenue increased $2.4 million, or 11.6%, due to an increase in deliverability services, technical account management, and support engagement services. These increases were partially offset by the decline in onboarding revenue as a result of the continued engagement of new customers with third-party partner-led onboarding. Additionally, in the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025, our international revenue increased by $62.4 million as we continued to expand market penetration in regions such as Europe and the Asia-Pacific region.

he increase in co
st of revenue of $35.7 million, or 24.2%, for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025 compared to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024 was primarily driven by an increase of $7.5 million in hosting, infrastructure, and other third-party fees associated with delivering our platform and a $24.0 million increase in third-party messaging fees associated with growth in premium messaging channels. In addition, we had an increase in personnel and overhead costs of $3.2 million. The increased infrastructure, messaging, and personnel costs were incurred to support overall revenue growth.
Our gross profit increased $85.9 million, or 26.5%, in the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025 compared to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024, and our gross margin increased by 0.4% to 69.1% in the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025 from 68.7% in the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024. These increases were due primarily to improved personnel efficiencies,

The increases were primarily due to investments in our finance and administrative functions to continue to scale our processes, systems, and controls, to enable our ongoing compliance with public company legal and regulatory requirements. The increases in expenses were partially offset by a decrease in professional services costs of $0.5 million related to the acquisition of North Star in the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024.

The investment income increase was driven primarily by the graded maturation of the portfolio positions at higher interest rates and the reinvestment of proceeds in a high interest rate environment.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Sources of Funds
As of January 31, 2025, our principal source of liquidity was cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of $514.0 million. Our cash and cash equivalents consist of deposit accounts, interest-bearing money market accounts, U.S. government, and corporate securities that are stated at fair value. Our marketable securities positions consists mostly of highly liquid short-term investments. The investment income that we generate on these investments is not material to our overall cash balance, but may be adversely affected due to volatility in interest rates. 
Since our inception, we have financed our operations primarily through the net proceeds received from the sales of equity securities and cash generated from the sale of subscriptions to our platform. We have generated losses from our operations as reflected in our accumulated deficit of $586.8 million as of January 31, 2025. We had cash flows provided by operating activities for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025 of $36.7 million.
A substantial source of our cash provided by operating activities is our deferred revenue, which is included on our consolidated balance sheets as a liability. Deferred revenue consists of the unearned portion of billed fees for our subscriptions, which is recorded as revenue over the term of the subscription agreement. As of January 31, 2025, we had total deferred revenue of $240.3 million, of which $240.0 million was recorded as a current liability. Deferred revenue will be recognized as revenue when all of the revenue recognition criteria are met.

Operating Activities
For the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025, net cash provided by operating activities was $36.7 million, primarily due to a net loss of $104.0 million adjusted for non-cash charges of $163.4 million and net changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $22.7 million. The non-cash adjustments primarily relate to stock-based compensation of $115.1 million, amortization of deferred contract costs of $35.0 million, depreciation and amortization expense of $10.1 million, and expense associated with the donation of our Class A common stock to a charitable donor-advised fund of $3.8 million. The cash inflows from changes in our operating assets and liabilities were primarily due to an increase in deferred revenue of $35.9 million as a result of increased billings driven by timing of subscriptions and renewals. The cash inflows were offset by cash outflows primarily from an increase in accounts receivable of $5.4 million and an increase in deferred contract costs of $48.2 million as a result of commissions on new bookings and renewals.
For the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024, net cash provided by operating activities was $6.9 million, primarily due to a net loss of $130.4 million adjusted for non-cash charges of $136.2 million and net changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $1.1 million. The non-cash adjustments primarily relate to stock-based compensation of $97.2 million, amortization of deferred contract costs of $29.8 million, depreciation and amortization expense of $7.0 million, and expense associated with the donation of our Class A common stock to a charitable donor-advised fund of $3.8 million. The cash inflows from changes in our operating assets and liabilities were primarily due to an increase in deferred revenue of $34.1 million as a result of increased billings driven by timing of subscriptions and renewals. The cash inflows were offset by cash outflows primarily from an increase in deferred contract costs of $45.1 million as a result of commissions on new bookings and renewals.
Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities was $36.5 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025, primarily consisting of purchases of marketable securities of $218.0 million,, purchases of property and equipment of $13.2 million, and capitalization of internal-use software costs of $3.8 million, partially offset by maturities of marketable securities of $195.4 million.

Net cash used in investing activities was $20.0 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024, primarily consisting of purchases of marketable securities of $248.1 million, cash paid for the acquisition of North Star of $16.3 million, purchases of property and equipment of $9.8 million, and capitalization of internal-use software costs of $3.6 million, partially offset by maturities of marketable securities of 257.7 million.
Financing Activities
Net cash provided by financing activities was $11.7 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025, primarily consisting of proceeds from the exercise of common stock options of $6.9 million and proceeds from stock purchases associated with our employee stock purchase plan of $7.7 million, offset by payments of deferred purchase considerations related to the acquisition of North Star of $2.9 million.
Net cash provided by financing activities was $13.1 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024, primarily consisting of proceeds from the exercise of common stock options of $7.3 million and proceeds from stock purchases associated with our employee stock purchase plan of $6.0 million, offset by payments of deferred purchase considerations related to the acquisition of North Star of $0.2 million.
Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow
We report our financial results in accordance with GAAP. To supplement our consolidated financial statements, we provide investors with the amount of free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Our management uses free cash flow to assess our operating performance and our progress towards our goal of positive free cash flow. We define free cash flow as net cash used in operating activities less cash used for purchases of property and equipment and amounts capitalized for internal-use software development costs. We believe that free cash flow is a useful indicator of liquidity as it measures our ability to generate cash, or our need to access additional sources of cash, to fund operations and investments.
Free cash flow has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are (1) it is not a substitute for net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities, (2) other companies may calculate free cash flow or similarly titled non-GAAP measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of free cash flow as a tool for comparison, and (3) the utility of free cash flow is further limited as it does not reflect our future contractual commitments and does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for any given period.
The following table presents a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities, the most directly comparable measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, for the periods presented:

Our free cash flow increased for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025 from the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024, primarily due to higher collections as a result of an increase in billings that are aligned with new contracts and contract renewals. We expect our free cash flow to fluctuate in future periods with changes in our operating expenses and as we continue to invest in our growth. Additionally, our free cash flow may be influenced by macroeconomic factors that impact our collection efforts for customer payments. If we experience collection pressure it may lengthen the time to collect on accounts receivable and increase our bad debt expense, either of which could negatively impact our free cash flow.
Liquidity Outlook
We assess our liquidity primarily through our cash on hand as well as the projected timing of billings under contracts with our paying customers and related collection cycles. While our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including revenue growth and costs incurred to support customer usage and growth in our customer base, increased research 
57
Table 
of Contents
and development expenses to support the growth of our business and related infrastructure, and increased general and administrative expenses to support being a publicly-traded company, we believe our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months.
Our most significant funding
 requirements are principally comprised of employee compensation and related taxes and benefits, non-cancelable purchase commitments, and operating lease obligations. Non-cancelable purchase commitments for business operations and operating lease obligations total $224.4 million and $114.8 million, respectively, as of January 31, 2025. Purchase commitments for business operations are predominately related to cloud hosting, infrastructure, and other software-based services and due primarily over the next three years. Our future funding requirements to settle our obligations in foreign jurisdictions are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign exchange rates.
While we anticipate being able to satisfy our commitments through a combination of our available current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, and cash generated from the sale of subscriptions to our platform, if our estimates prove to be inaccurate we may seek to sell additional equity or other securities that may result in dilution to our stockholders, issue debt or seek other third-party funding, in order to satisfy our future funding requirements.
Seasonality
We have experienced seasonality in our cost of revenue as a result of our customers’ increased usage of our platform based on their business demands. We typically experience the highest sequential increase in overall messaging volume and compute and storage requirements during the fourth quarter due to the increased activity related to the holiday season and general customer engagement efforts around the end of the calendar year.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates.
We believe that the following critical accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgement or complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. 
Revenue Recognition
We generate revenue from fees related to subscription services and professional services and other. We recognize revenue related to contracts with customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those services. This is determined by following a five-step process, which includes (1) identifying the contract with a customer, (2) identifying the performance obligations in the contract, (3) determining the transaction price, (4) allocating the transaction price and (5) recognizing revenue when we satisfy a performance obligation.
We identify performance obligations in a contract based on the goods and services that will be transferred to the customer that are identifiable from other promises in the contract, or that are distinct. If not considered distinct, the promised goods or services are combined with other goods or services and accounted for as a combined performance obligation. Determining the distinct performance obligations in a contract requires judgment. Our performance obligations primarily include access to our platform, which includes subscription contracts, technical support and platform updates and professional services, which include onboarding services.
We allocate the transaction price of the contract to each distinct performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis. Estimating standalone selling prices for our performance obligations requires judgment and is based on multiple factors, including, but not limited to, observable cost data, industry margin studies, historical selling prices, internal cost structure, internal pricing policies, and pricing practices in different regions and sales channels. We review the estimated standalone selling price for our performance obligations periodically and update, if needed, to ensure that the methodology utilized reflects our current pricing practices. The transaction price allocated to each performance obligation is recognized as revenue when or as the products or services are transferred to the customer.
Cost to Obtain a Contract with a Customer
58
Table 
of Contents
We capitalize incremental costs of obtaining revenue contracts, which primarily consist of internal sales commissions and agent commissions. We amortize these commissions on a systematic basis, consistent with the pattern of transfer of the expected benefit period or services to which the contract relates, generally up to four years. Four years represents the estimated benefit period of the customer relationship taking into account factors such as peer estimates of technology lives and customer lives as well as our own historical data. Commissions paid for contract renewals are amortized over the renewal period.
Contract costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over up to four years, which reflects the expected period of benefit of the performance obligation, and may be longer than the initial contract period. We determine the estimated benefit period by considering both qualitative and quantitative factors, including the length of the subscription terms in our customer contracts and the anticipated life of our technology, among other factors.
Income Taxes
We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.
In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred income tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including our operating results, ongoing tax planning, and forecasts of future taxable income on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis. In the event we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, we would make an adjustment to the valuation allowance that would reduce the provision for income taxes. Conversely, in the event that all or part of the net deferred tax assets are determined not to be realizable in the future, we would charge an adjustment to the valuation allowance to earnings in the period when such determination is made. As of January 31, 2025, we recorded a full valuation allowance in jurisdictions where we had net deferred tax assets, which consist of net operating loss carryforwards and other basis differences, as we have concluded that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will not be realized.

We are exposed to market risk in the ordinary course of our business. Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily the result of fluctuations in interest rates.
Inflation Risk
We do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations, other than its impact on the general economy. Nonetheless, if our costs were to become subject to inflationary pressures, we might not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. Our inability or failure to do so could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
Interest Rate Risk and Market Risk
We had cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of $514.0 million as of January 31, 2025, of which $430.5 million was invested in U.S. government securities, foreign securities, and corporate debt securities. Our cash and cash equivalents are held for working capital and general corporate purposes. Our investments in marketable securities are made for capital preservation purposes. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes.
Our cash equivalents and our portfolio of marketable securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. Fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. As of January 31, 2025, a hypothetical 10% change in interest rates would not have had a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. Because we classify our debt securities as “available for sale,” no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or unless declines in fair value are determined to be non-temporary.
Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk
59
Table 
of Contents
Our reporting and functional currency is the U.S. dollar, and the functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is primarily the respective local currency. Substantially all of our sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. Our only sales denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollars are our sales in Japan, which are denominated in Yen. Therefore, our revenue is not currently subject to significant foreign currency risk. Our operating expenses are denominated in the currencies of the countries in which our operations are located, which are primarily the United States, United Kingdom, Singapore and Japan. The consolidated results of operations and cash flows are therefore subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and may be adversely affected in the future due to changes in foreign exchange rates. The assets and liabilities of each of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect at each balance sheet date. Adjustments resulting from translating foreign functional currency financial statements into U.S. dollars are recorded as a separate component on the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss. Gains or losses due to transactions in foreign currencies are included in interest and other income, net in the consolidated statements of operations.
The volatility of exchange rates depends on many factors that we cannot forecast with reliable accuracy. We have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in foreign exchange gains and losses related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In the event our foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities, revenue, or expenses increase, our results of operations may be more greatly affected by fluctuations in the exchange rates of the currencies in which we do business. To date we have not engaged in the hedging of foreign currency transactions, although we may choose to do so in the future. A hypothetical 10% change in the relative value of the U.S. dollar to other currencies during any of the periods presented would not have had a material effect on our realized and unrealized gains (losses) on foreign exchange transactions.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Braze, Inc.
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Braze, Inc. (the Company) as of January 31, 2025 and 2024, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, redeemable non-controlling interest and stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2025, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at January 31, 2025 and 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2025, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated March 31, 2025 expressed an adverse opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Revenue Recognition
Description of the Matter
During the year ended January 31, 2025, the Company recognized revenue of $593.4 million and recorded deferred revenue of $240.3 million as of January 31, 2025. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company derives revenue primarily from subscriptions to their platform, including associated support, and professional services. Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. 
Auditing management’s recognition of revenue was challenging due to the nature and extent of effort required as a result of the high volume of revenue contracts and the use of multiple applications and data sources in the revenue recognition process. In addition, as described in Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management identified a material weakness in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting associated with the information technology general controls of various information systems, including those that affect the revenue recognition process, which required changes to the extent of our audit procedures.
How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit
We performed audit procedures that included, among others, testing the completeness and accuracy of data used within the Company’s revenue recognition process. For a sample of customer contracts, we compared the contractual terms to reports derived from the Company’s systems, recalculated the amount of revenue recognized and related deferred revenue, and reviewed evidence of the related cash receipts. In response to the material weakness discussed above, we increased the extent of revenue contract samples tested. We also performed analytical procedures to quantify the expected deferred revenue amount based on the monthly invoicing activities and compared it to the amounts recorded by the Company. Finally, we assessed the appropriateness of the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.

Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited Braze, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, because of the effect of the material weakness described below on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, Braze, Inc. (the Company) has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2025, based on the COSO criteria.
A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The following material weakness has been identified and included in management’s assessment. Management has identified a material weakness in controls related to the operation of information technology (IT) general controls for IT applications supporting the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. 
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of January 31, 2025 and 2024, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, redeemable non-controlling interest and stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2025, and the related notes. This material weakness was considered in determining the nature, timing and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2025 consolidated financial statements, and this report does not affect our report dated March 31, 2025, which expressed an unqualified opinion, thereon.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

BRAZE, INC.
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. 
Company Overview

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and variable interest entities (“VIE”) for which we are the primary beneficiary. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Reclassifications
Certain reclassifications and immaterial changes have been made to prior-period financial statements to conform to the current-period presentation.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reported period. We evaluate estimates based on historical and anticipated results, trends, and various other assumptions. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to, the standalone selling price for separate performance obligations in our revenue arrangements, expected period of benefit for deferred contract costs, the valuation of common stock and stock-based compensation, the allocation of overhead costs between cost of revenue and operating expenses, the estimated useful lives of intangible and depreciable assets, the fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities from business combinations, valuation of long-lived assets and their recoverability, including goodwill, the incremental borrowing rate, the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and other tax estimates including our ability to utilize net operating losses.
Management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors, including the current economic environment, and makes adjustments as facts and circumstances dictate. As future events and their effects, including the uncertainty surrounding rapidly changing market and economic conditions from global or domestic macroeconomic and socioeconomic conditions such as, among others, instability in the banking and financial services sector, international and domestic supply chain risks, inflationary pressure, interest rate increases, declines in consumer confidence, international conflicts and domestic and foreign political unrest, that impact us and our customers, cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ from those estimates and many of our estimates and assumptions have required increased judgement and carry a higher degree of variability and volatility.
Basic and Diluted Net Loss attributable to Braze, Inc. Common Stockholders per Share 
Basic net loss attributable to Braze, Inc. per common stockholder’s share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of Braze, Inc. common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss attributable to Braze, Inc. by the weighted-average number of shares of Braze, Inc. common stock together with the number of additional shares of Braze Inc. common stock that would have been outstanding if all potentially dilutive shares of Braze Inc. common stock had been issued. Since we were in a net loss position for the periods presented, basic net loss per share attributable to Braze, Inc. common stockholders is the same as diluted net loss per share attributable to Braze, Inc. common stockholders since the effects of potentially dilutive securities are antidilutive.

Segment Reporting
Operating segments are defined as components of an entity for which discrete financial information is available that is regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) in deciding how to allocate resources to an individual segment and in assessing performance. Our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) is the CODM. The CODM reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis for purposes of making operating decisions, allocating resources, and evaluating financial performance. As such, we have 
one
 operating segment, which is the business of cloud-based customer engagement platform subscriptions.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The guidance describes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable, that may be used to measure fair value.
Level 1 – 
Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date.
Level 2 – 
Inputs are observable, unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities; unadjusted quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the related assets or liabilities.
Level 3 – 
Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market data for the related assets or liabilities.
The categorization of a financial instrument within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our financial instruments include cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and other current assets and liabilities. At January 31, 2025 and 2024, the carrying amounts of accounts receivable, accounts payable, and other current assets and liabilities approximated fair values because of their short-term nature.
Foreign Currency
The functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is primarily the local currency. Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are remeasured to the functional currency at the exchange rate on the transaction date. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are remeasured at period-end using the period-end exchange rate. Gains and losses resulting from remeasurement are recorded in other income (expense), net, on the consolidated statements of operations. All assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated at the current exchange rate as of the end of the period, retained earnings and other equity items are translated at historical rates, and revenue and expenses are translated at average exchange rates in effect during the period. The gain or loss resulting from the process of translating foreign currency financial statements into U.S. dollars is reflected as foreign currency cumulative translation adjustments reported on the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss. 
Transaction gains and losses that arise from exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are included in other income (expense), net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations when realized.
 
Cash and cash equivalents represent cash and highly liquid investments with original contractual maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase. Cash and cash equivalents consist of deposit accounts and interest-bearing money market accounts that are stated at fair value.
As of January 31, 2025 and 2024, approximately $
0.5
 million and $
3.9
 million, respectively, of deposits were restricted due to multiple letters of credit related to our leased and subleased properties. These deposits were classified as current and noncurrent based on the related underlying lease term.
The following table provides a reconciliation of the cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash as of January 31, 2025 and 2024 (in thousands):

Accounts Receivable, Net and Credit Losses
Accounts receivable, net consists of customer obligations due under normal trade terms and are recorded at amounts billed and unbilled to customers, net of allowance for any potential uncollectible accounts. Unbilled amounts are included in trade accounts receivable, net, which generally arise from our contractual right to bill our customers in advance of services on the contract effective date. Trade accounts receivable are recorded at invoiced amounts and do not bear interest. 
We maintain an allowance for credit losses for accounts receivable, net which is recorded as an offset to accounts receivable, net and changes in this allowance are recorded as general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. We assess collectability by reviewing accounts receivable on a collective basis when similar characteristics exist and on an individual basis when we identify specific customers with known disputes or collectability issues. In determining the amount of the allowance for credit losses, we consider historical collectability based on past due status and make judgements about the creditworthiness of customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. A receivable is considered past due if we have not received payment based on agreed-upon terms. We also consider customer-specific information, current market conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions to inform adjustments to historical loss data. No material write-offs of accounts receivable have been recognized in any of the periods presented.
 
Concentration of Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, marketable securities, and accounts receivable. Restricted cash consists of letters of credit related to our leased properties. For cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities, we are exposed to credit risk in the event of default by the financial institutions to the extent of the amounts recorded on the consolidated balance sheets in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) limits. Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities balances are maintained at financial institutions that management believes are of high-credit, quality financial institutions, where deposits, at times, exceed the FDIC limits.
Significant customers are those which represent 10% or more of our total revenue for the period, or accounts receivable at the balance sheets dates. For fiscal years ended January 31, 2025 and 2024, no customer accounted for 10% or more of total revenue. 
For accounts receivable, we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonpayment by customers to the extent of the amounts recorded on the consolidated balance sheets. As of January 31, 2025, one customer accounted for approximately 
12
% of accounts receivable; no other customer accounted for more than 10% of our total accounts receivable balance. As of January 31, 2024, one customer accounted for approximately 
11
% of our accounts receivable; no other customer accounted for more than 10% of our total accounts receivable balance.
Marketable Securities
We classify our investments in marketable securities within current assets on the consolidated balance sheets as the investments are available for use, if needed, in current operations as we may sell our marketable securities at any time, without significant penalty, even if they have not yet reached maturity. These investments are carried at fair value, based on quoted market rates when observable or utilizing data points that are observable, such as quoted prices, interest rates and yield curves. Gains and losses are determined based on the specific identification method and are recognized when realized as a component of other income (expense), net in our consolidated statements of operations.
We review our securities on a regular basis to evaluate if any security has experienced an other-than temporary decline in fair value. We consider an available-for-sale security to be impaired if the fair value of the investment is less than its amortized cost basis, our intent to sell, or whether it is more likely than not that we are required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If we believe that an other-than-temporary decline exists in one of the securities, we will write down these investments to fair value. To the extent that the decline in fair value is related to credit losses, such as changes to the rating of the security by third-party rating agencies, and adverse conditions specific to the security, among other factors, the write-down related to credit loss would be recorded in other income, net in the consolidated statements of operations. Impairments related to 
73
Table 
of Contents
factors other than credit losses are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss. As of January 31, 2025, the Company had not recorded any credit impairments.
 
Property and Equipment, Net
Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the related asset. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the lease term or estimated useful life of the asset. Costs of maintenance and repairs that do not improve or extend the lives of the respective assets are expensed as incurred. Upon asset retirement or sale, the cost and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the consolidated balance sheets, and the resulting gain or loss is reflected in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.
 
The estimated useful lives for significant property and equipment categories are as follows:
Computer equipment, office equipment, and software
3
 to 
5
 years
Furniture and fixtures
7
 years
Leasehold improvements
Shorter of lease term or estimated useful life of assets
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived assets, subject to depreciation and amortization, such as property and equipment, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets or asset groups may not be recoverable or that the useful life is shorter than originally estimated. Recoverability of these assets or asset groups is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of each asset or asset group to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset or asset group is expected to generate over their remaining lives. If the asset or asset group is considered to be impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset or asset group. If the useful life is shorter than originally estimated, we amortize the remaining carrying value over the new shorter useful life.
 There w
ere 
no
 material impair
ment losses of long-lived assets recognized for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2025, 2024 and 
2023.
Capitalized Internal-use Software Costs
We capitalize certain costs incurred to develop new or additional customer-facing software functionality, on the consolidated balance sheets as a component of property and equipment, net. We capitalize qualifying personnel costs, including stock-based compensation, and consulting costs incurred during the application development stage so long as the project is authorized, it is probable the project will be completed, and the software will be used to perform the function intended. Costs incurred during the preliminary project and post-implementation stages are expensed as incurred and included in research and development expenses on the consolidated statements of operations. These capitalized costs are amortized over the software’s expected useful life, which is generally 
three years
, within cost of revenue on the consolidated statements of operations.
Comprehensive Loss
Our comprehensive loss is currently comprised of unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale securities and foreign currency translation adjustments.
Variable Interest Entity
A Variable Interest Entity (“VIE”) is an entity that either has insufficient equity to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support or has equity investors who lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the party with both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb the losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. 
To assess whether we have the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact its economic performance, we consider all the facts and circumstances including our role in establishing the VIE and our ongoing rights and responsibilities. This assessment includes identifying the activities that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and identifying which party, if any, has power over those activities. In general, the party that makes the most significant decisions affecting the VIE is determined to have the power to direct the activities of the VIE. To assess whether we have the obligation to absorb the losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE, we consider all of our economic interests, including debt and equity interests, servicing rights and fee arrangements, and any other variable interests in the VIE. If we determine that we are the party with the power to make the most significant decisions 
74
Table 
of Contents
affecting the VIE, and we have an obligation to absorb the losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE, then we consolidate the VIE.
We perform ongoing reassessments of whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE. The reassessment process considers whether we have acquired or divested the power to direct the most significant activities of the VIE through changes in governing documents or other circumstances. We also reconsider whether entities previously determined not to be VIEs have become VIEs, based on new events, and therefore could be subject to the VIE consolidation framework.
Redeemable Non-controlling Interest
Redeemable non-controlling interests represent the portion of net income (loss), net, and comprehensive income (loss), net, that is not allocable to us, in situations where we consolidate an equity interest or as the primary beneficiary of a VIE for which there are other owners. The amount of non-controlling interest is comprised of the greater of the amount of such interests at the date of the original acquisition of an equity interest in an investment, plus the other shareholders’ share of changes in equity since the date of the investment or estimated redemption value. The resulting changes in the estimated redemption amount (increases or decreases) are recorded with corresponding adjustments against retained earnings or, in the absence of retained earnings, additional paid-in-capital. The redeemable non-controlling interest is classified outside of permanent equity as mezzanine equity on the consolidated balance sheets as the redemption option is outside of our control.
Revenue Recognition
We derive our revenue primarily from subscriptions to our platform, including associated support, and professional services. Our subscriptions do not provide customers with the right to take possession of the software supporting the applications and, as a result, are accounted for as service contracts. Professional services primarily consist of fees for distinct services rendered in training and assisting customers to configure and optimize the use of the platform. Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to clients in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. We apply the following five-step model to recognize revenue from contracts with clients:
•
Identification of the contract or contracts with a customer;
•
Identification of the performance obligation(s) in the contract;
•
Determination of the transaction price;
•
Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligation(s) in the contract; and
•
Recognition of revenue when, or as, a performance obligation is satisfied.
We identify the performance obligations in a contract or multiple contracts with a customer and determine whether they are distinct or distinct within the context of the contract. When there is more than one distinct performance obligation in a contract, we allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis based on standalone selling prices (“SSP”). We have identified two performance obligations within our contracts with our customers: (i) subscription and (ii) professional services and other.
All contracts generally contain fixed consideration payable upfront by the customer. Some of our multi-year arrangements may contain fixed fees with escalating pricing structures each year. The nature of our subscription performance obligation remains unchanged each period of the arrangement and therefore may create a contract asset reflecting the difference between the amount of revenue recognized compared to the amount billed.
Some of our contracts with customers contain terms, such as service level guarantees, product usage and overage fees, that, along with various potential claims, including breach of warranty, may result in variable consideration. Variable consideration exists when the amount which we expect to receive in a contract is affected by the occurrence or non-occurrence of future events. We develop estimates of variable consideration on the basis of historical information, current trends, and any other specific knowledge about future periods.
Variable consideration is included in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. Typically, our contracts do not provide customers with any right of return or refund; however, we may make exceptions on a case-by-case basis when it makes commercial sense. Variable consideration, including as a result of service level guarantees, product usage and overage fees or other potential claims such as breach of warranty, was not material during the fiscal years ended January 31, 2025, 2024, and 2023. We allocate the variable consideration related to the product usages and overages to the distinct month during which the related services were performed as those fees relate specifically to providing usage of the platform in the period and represents the consideration we are entitled to for the access to the platform. As a result, the usage and overage fees are included in the transaction price and recognized as revenue in the period in which the fee was generated.
75
Table 
of Contents
To the extent that we grant customers an option to acquire additional products or services, we account for the option as a distinct performance obligation in the contract only if the option provides a material right to the customer that the customer would not receive without entering into the contract. If a material right exists in a contract, revenue allocated to the option is deferred and recognized as revenue only when those future products or services are transferred or when the option expires. Contracts do not typically contain material rights and when they do, the material right has not been significant to our consolidated financial statements.
Once the transaction price is determined, the total transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation in a manner depicting the amount of consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for transferring the products or services to the customer. This allocation is based on the SSP of the products or services included in the arrangement.
Judgment is required to determine the SSP for each performance obligation. We determine SSP based on observable prices for those related goods or services when sold separately, if available. When such observable prices are not available, we determine SSP based on overarching pricing objectives and strategies, taking into consideration market conditions and other factors, including transaction size, product-specific factors, historical sales of the deliverables and costs to deliver the services and applicable margins.
Subscription Services
Subscription revenue is recognized ratably over the contract term beginning on the commencement date of each contract, which is the date the platform is made available to customers. We have determined that subscriptions to our platform represent a stand-ready obligation to perform over the subscription term. These performance obligations are satisfied over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits. Contracts are typically 
one year
 in length, but may be up to 
five years
.
At the beginning of each subscription term we invoice our customers, typically in annual installments but also quarterly and semi-annually. Amounts that have been invoiced for non-cancelable contracts are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue. We report revenue net of sales tax and other taxes collected from customers to be remitted to government authorities.
Professional Services and Other
Professional services and other revenue primarily consist of onboarding services and are typically recognized as services are performed since our customers simultaneously receive the benefits of these services as they are performed, which is generally over a period of up to six months from provisioning access to the platform. We invoice our customers for professional services at the outset of the contract. Amounts that have been invoiced for non-cancelable contracts are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue. We report revenue net of sales tax and other taxes collected from customers to be remitted to government authorities.
Contract Balances
Contract Assets
A contract asset is the right to consideration for transferred goods or services when the amount is conditioned on something other than the passage of time. These balances are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets on our consolidated balance sheets.
Deferred Revenue
We record deferred revenue when we have an unconditional right to payments in advance of satisfying the performance obligations on our contracts. The balance consists primarily of annual plan subscription services and professional services not yet provided as of the balance sheet date. Deferred revenue that will be recognized during the succeeding twelve-month period is recorded as a current liability in our consolidated balance sheets. The deferred revenue balance does not represent the total contract value of annual or multi-year, non-cancelable agreements.
Deferred Contract Costs
We capitalize costs of obtaining revenue contracts that are incremental and recoverable. Incremental costs primarily include sales commissions and bonuses for new and renewal revenue contracts and associated payroll tax and fringe benefit costs and are recorded within deferred contract costs on the consolidated balance sheets. Capitalized amounts are recoverable through future revenue streams under all customer contracts.
76
Table 
of Contents
Contract costs are amortized on a straight-line basis up to 
four years
, which reflects the expected period of benefit of the performance obligation and may be longer than the initial contract period. We determined the estimated benefit period having considered both qualitative and quantitative factors, including the length of the subscription terms in our customer contracts and the anticipated life of our technology, among other such factors. Deferred contract costs related to renewals are amortized over the renewal term which is generally 
one year
 to 
three years
. Amortization of contract costs are classified within operating expenses based on the function of the underlying employee receiving the benefit in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
Deferred contract costs are periodically analyzed for impairment. As of January 31, 2025 and 2024, we have not identified any potential indicators of impairment.
Cost of Revenue
Cost of revenue consists of expenses related to providing platform access to customers and onboarding services. These costs include payments to third-party cloud infrastructure providers for hosting software solutions and costs associated with application service providers utilized to deliver the platform, allocated personnel-related costs, including salaries, cash-based performance compensation, benefits and stock-based compensation, overhead cost allocations related to facilities and shared IT-related expenses, including depreciation expense and amortization of internal use software.
Operating Expenses
Operating expenses consist of sales and marketing, research and development, and general and administrative expenses. Personnel costs are the most significant component of operating expenses and consist of salaries, cash performance-based compensation, employee benefits and stock-based compensation. Operating expenses also include overhead cost allocations.
Sales and Marketing
Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for sales and marketing organization, costs related to sponsorships, events and advertising, agency costs, travel-related expenses, and allocated overhead costs. Costs associated with our advertising and sales promotions are expensed as incurred. During the fiscal years ended January 31, 2025, 2024, and 2023, we recognized $
30.3
 million, $
25.1
 million, and $
20.8
 million, respectively, in advertising costs, which included brand and sponsorship costs.
Research and Development
Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for engineering, service, design, and information technology teams. Additionally, research and development expenses include allocated overhead costs and contractor fees. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Capitalized internal-use software development costs are excluded from research and development expenses as they are capitalized as a component of property and equipment, net and amortized to cost of revenue over the software’s expected useful life, which is generally 
three years
.
General and Administrative
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for finance, legal, human resources and other administrative functions, as well as outside professional services. In addition, general and administrative expense includes non-personnel costs, such as legal, accounting and other professional fees, software costs, certain tax, license and insurance-related expenses and allocated overhead costs.
Stock-Based Compensation
We measure our employee and director stock-based payment awards, including purchase rights issued under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, based on the award’s fair value as determined on the date of grant. 
We recognize stock-based compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over the requisite service period of the individual grant, generally equal to the vesting period, and use the straight-line method to recognize stock-based compensation. 
We estimate expected forfeitures of stock-based awards at the grant date and recognize compensation cost only for those awards expected to vest. We estimate our forfeitures rate based on an analysis of our actual historical forfeitures materializing in the previous fiscal years, and revise the estimates, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. We routinely evaluate the appropriateness of the forfeiture rate based on actual forfeiture experience, analysis of employee turnover and expectations of future option exercise behavior.

Investment Income
Investment income consists primarily of income earned on our investments, cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash.
Other Income, Net
Other income, net, is primarily comprised of realized and unrealized foreign currency gains and losses.
Leases
The Company determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception by assessing whether the arrangement contains an identified asset and whether we have the right to control the identified asset. Right-of-use (“ROU”) assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of the future lease payments over the lease term. ROU assets are based on the measurement of the lease liability and also include any lease payments made prior to or on lease commencement and exclude lease incentives and initial direct costs incurred, as applicable. 
As the implicit rate in our leases is generally unknown, we use the incremental borrowing rate based on the estimated rate of interest for collateralized borrowing over a similar term of the lease payments at commencement date. The lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain we will exercise any such options. Lease costs for our operating leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Finance lease assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the lease term. The interest component of finance leases is included in interest expense and recognized using the effective interest method over the lease term. We did not have any finance leases in the periods presented.
We have elected to not separate lease and non-lease components for any leases within our existing classes of assets and, as a result, we account for any lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. We have also elected to not apply the recognition requirement to any leases within our existing classes of assets with a term of 12 months or less (short-term leases). Variable lease costs are comprised primarily of our proportionate share of operating expenses, property taxes, and insurance and is classified as lease cost due to our election to not separate lease and non-lease components.
Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use assets, current operating lease liabilities, and non-current in our consolidated balance sheets.
 Refer to Note 14. Leases, for further information.
Income Taxes
We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred income tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, using a more likely than not standard. The evaluation considers our recent historical operating results, ongoing tax planning, and forecasts of future taxable income on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis. In the event we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, we would make an adjustment to the valuation allowance that would reduce the provision for income taxes. Conversely, in the event that all or part of the net deferred tax assets are determined not to be realizable in the future, we would charge an adjustment to the valuation allowance to earnings in the period when such determination is made. As of January 31, 2025, we recorded a full valuation allowance in jurisdictions where we had net deferred tax assets, which consist of net operating loss carryforwards and other basis differences, as we have concluded that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will not be realized.
We recognize tax expense associated with Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income as it is incurred as part of the current income taxes to be paid or refunded for the current period.
We recognize the tax benefits on any uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the consolidated financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be realized upon ultimate settlement with tax authorities, assuming full knowledge of the position and relevant facts. The tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.

Business Combinations
The Company recognizes identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values. The excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the acquisition date is recorded as goodwill. Such valuations require the Company to make significant estimates and assumptions. The Company uses its best estimates and assumptions as part of the purchase price allocation process to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed, but these estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. During the measurement period, the Company may record adjustments to the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations.
 
Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of net identifiable assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized and are tested for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level.
The Company has the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible assets are less than its carrying amount. The Company may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to the quantitative impairment tests. The quantitative impairment test for goodwill involves comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. A goodwill impairment will be the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value. The impairment is limited to the carrying amount of goodwill. 
The quantitative impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value. If the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The estimates of fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets are determined using a discounted cash flow valuation analysis that employs different valuation methodology in estimating the fair value of the asset. Significant judgments are inherent in the discounted cash flow analysis.
The Company has determined that it operates as one reporting unit and has selected November 1 as the date to perform its annual impairment test. No goodwill impairment charges have been recorded for any period presented.
Restructuring
Restructuring costs generally include significant actions involving employee-related severance payments, benefits, and certain facilitation costs, associated with our workforce reductions. Employee-related severance charges are largely based upon substantive severance plans, while some are mandated requirements in certain foreign jurisdictions. Severance costs generally include severance payments, health insurance coverage, and legal costs. These charges are reflected in the period when both the actions are probable, at the balance sheet date, and the amounts are reasonably estimable.
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which enhances reportable segment disclosure requirements primarily through expanded disclosures around significant segment expenses. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and for interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The amendments should be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. The Company adopted ASU 2023-07 as of the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025. The adoption of ASU 2023-07 did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted
In December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2023-09 Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, (“ASU 2023-09”), which requires public business entities on an annual basis to disclose specific categories in a tabular rate reconciliation and provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a five percent quantitative threshold. Additionally, the ASU requires all entities to disclose the amount of income taxes paid disaggregated by federal, state, and foreign taxes, as well as individual jurisdictions where income taxes paid are equal to or greater than five percent of total income taxes paid. ASU 2023-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted and the updated should be applied on a prospective basis, with a retrospective

Variable Interest Entity and Redeemable Non-Controlling Interest
On September 14, 2020, we, along with Japan Cloud Computing Co., Ltd., and M30 LLC, (the “Investors”), entered into an agreement, whereby each Investor agreed to purchase shares of common stock of Braze Kabushiki Kaisha (“Braze KK” and “Braze KK Shares”) for a total purchase price of $
10.0
 million in two tranches of $
5.0
 million per tranche in September 2020 and September 2021, to engage in the investment, organization, management and operation of Braze KK focused on the distribution of our products in Japan. The purpose of this arrangement was to further expand our business in the Japanese market.
In March 2022, we consented to the periodic issuance of stock options to purchase Braze KK Shares by certain employees of Braze KK. These options cannot be exercised by the holders thereof prior to the exercise of the call or put options described in more detail below. The Company considers the stock options to be a substantive class of equity, classified as a liability within other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. As of January 31, 2025, the liability balance was $
1.1
 million. The issuance of stock options does not impact our majority stake in Braze KK, as none of the vesting criteria of the options were met as of the balance sheet date. The issuance of stock options did not result in a reconsideration event and therefore Braze KK still met the criteria of a Variable Interest Entity as Braze KK did not have sufficient equity at risk to finance their activities. As a result, we continue to operate Braze KK as a subsidiary, exposing us to business and foreign exchange risk. We consolidate Braze KK and present the results within the consolidated balance sheets, consolidated statements of operations, and consolidated statements of cash flows.
The common stock held by the Investors is callable by us or puttable by the Investors upon certain contingent events.
 Should the call or put option be exercised, the redemption value would be determined based on a prescribed formula derived from the discrete revenues of Braze KK and the Company and may be settled, at our discretion, with our stock or cash. The non-controlling interest in Braze KK is classified in mezzanine equity as redeemable non-controlling interest as a result of the put right available to the Investors in the future, an event that is not solely in our control. The non-controlling interest is not accreted to redemption value because it is currently not probable that the non-controlling interest will become redeemable.
The following table summarizes the activity in the redeemable non-controlling interests for the periods indicated below (in thousands):

Our money market funds and financial instruments that are classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy, because they are valued using quoted prices in active markets as of January 31, 2025 and January 31, 2024. Financial instruments classified as Level 2 within our fair value hierarchy are valued on the basis of prices from an orderly transaction between market participants provided by reputable dealers or pricing services. Prices of these securities are obtained through independent, third-party pricing services and include market quotations that may include both observable and unobservable inputs. In determining the value of a particular investment, pricing services may use certain information with respect to transactions in such investments, quotations from dealers, pricing matrices and market transactions in comparable investments and various relationships between investments. 
The fair value of our contingent consideration is estimated using Level 3 unobservable inputs. The estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are uncertain, and involve significant judgments by management. We will reassess the fair value of the contingent consideration quarterly until the contingency is resolved. If applicable, changes in the fair value are recorded in operating income in the consolidated statements of operations. As of January 31, 2025, the Company reduced the contingent consideration liability to zero as it was determined that the likelihood of the sellers satisfying the qualifications is remote.
There were no transfers of financial instruments among Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 during the periods presented.

The Company purchases investment grade marketable debt securities which are rated by nationally recognized statistical credit rating organizations in accordance with its investment policy. This policy is designed to minimize the Company's exposure to credit losses. As of January 31, 2025, the credit-quality of the Company’s marketable available-for-sale debt securities had remained stable. The unrealized losses recognized on marketable available-for-sale debt securities as of January 31, 2025 was primarily related to the continued market volatility associated with market expectations in the current interest rate environment. The contractual terms of these investments do not permit the issuer to settle the securities at a price less than the amortized cost basis of the investments and it is not expected that the investments would be settled at a price less 
85

than their amortized cost basis. The Company does not intend to sell the investments and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost basis. The Company is not aware of any specific event or circumstance that would require the Company to change its assessment of credit losses for any marketable available-for-sale debt security as of January 31, 2025. These estimates may change, as new events occur and additional information is obtained, and will be recognized on the consolidated financial statements as soon as they become known.

Stockholders’ Equity
Class A and Class B Common Stock
The Company has 
two
 classes of common stock, Class A and Class B. The rights of the holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock are identical, except with respect to voting, conversion, and transfer rights. Each share of Class A common stock is entitled to 
one
 vote. Each share of Class B common stock is entitled to 
ten
 votes and may be converted at the option of the holder into 
one
 share of Class A common stock. In addition, all shares of Class B common stock will automatically convert into shares of Class A common stock in certain circumstances, including on the earlier of (i) the last trading day of the fiscal quarter during which the number of shares of Class B common stock then outstanding represents less than 
10
% of the aggregate number of shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock then outstanding, or (ii) the last trading day of the fiscal quarter immediately following the fifth anniversary of the initial public offering. All shares of the 
87
Table

Company’s capital stock outstanding immediately prior to our initial public offering, including all shares held by its executive officers, directors, and their respective affiliates, and all shares issuable upon the conversion of our then outstanding convertible preferred stock, were reclassified into shares of Class B common stock immediately prior to the completion of the initial public offering.

Employee Stock Plans
We have historically issued equity awards under our Amended and Restated 2011 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2011 Plan”) and our 2021 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2021 Plan”).
Amended and Restated 2011 Equity Incentive Plan
Our 2011 Plan provides for the award of stock options and restricted stock units (“RSUs”) to employees, officers, directors, advisors and other service providers of Braze. The terms of each award and the exercise price of awards under the 2011 Plan are determined by our board of directors. Following effectiveness of the 2021 Plan in connection with our initial public offering, no further awards were made under the 2011 Plan.
2021 Equity Incentive Plan
In November 2021, our board of directors and our stockholders approved the 2021 Plan, which became effective on November 16, 2021. No grants were made under the 2021 Plan prior to its effectiveness. No further grants will be made under the 2011 Plan. At effectiveness, we reserved 
25,660,249
 shares of our Class A common stock to be issued under the 2021 Plan. In addition, the number of shares of our Class A common stock reserved for issuance under the 2021 Plan will automatically increase on February 1 of each year for a period of ten years, beginning on February 1, 2022 and continuing through February 1, 2031, in an amount equal to (1) 
5
% of the total number of shares of our common stock (both Class A and Class B) outstanding on the preceding January 31, or (2) a lesser number of shares determined by our board of directors no later than the February 1 increase. On February 1, 2024, the number of shares of our Class A common stock reserved for issuance under our 2021 Plan increased by an additional 
5,010,520
 shares.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan
In November 2021, our board of directors and our stockholders approved the 2021 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”), which became effective on November 16, 2021. Following completion of our initial public offering, the ESPP authorized the issuance of 
1,825,000
 shares of our Class A common stock under purchase rights granted to our employees or to employees of any of our designated affiliates. The number of shares of our Class A common stock reserved for issuance will automatically increase on February 1 of each year for a period of 
ten years
, beginning on February 1, 2022 and continuing through February 1, 2031, by the lesser of (i) 
1
% of the total number of shares of our common stock (both Class A and Class B) outstanding on the preceding January 31; and (ii) 
2,737,000
 shares, except before the date of any such increase, our board of directors may determine that such increase will be less than the amount set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) above. On February 1, 2024, the number of shares of our Class A common stock reserved for issuance under our ESPP increased by an additional 
1,002,104
 shares.
89
Table 
of Contents
The ESPP is implemented through a series of offerings under which eligible employees are granted purchase rights to purchase shares of the Company’s Class A common stock on specified dates during such offerings. Under the ESPP, our board of directors will be permitted to specify offerings with durations of not more than 27 months, and may specify shorter purchase periods within each offering. Each offering will have one or more purchase dates on which shares of our Class A common stock will be purchased for employees participating in the offering. On each purchase date, eligible employees will purchase the shares at a price per share equal to 
85
% of the lesser of (1) the fair market value of the Company’s Class A common stock on the first trading day of the offering period or (2) the fair market value of the Company’s Class A common stock on the last day of the offering period, as defined by the ESPP.

Commitments and Contingencies
Indirect Taxes
We are subject to indirect taxation in some, but not all, of the various U.S. states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Therefore, we have an obligation to charge, collect and remit Value Added Tax (“VAT”) or Goods and Services Tax (“GST”) in connection with certain of our foreign sales transactions and sales and use tax in connection with eligible sales to subscribers in certain U.S. states. On June 21, 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court issued an opinion in South Dakota v. Wayfair. The State of South Dakota alleged that U.S. constitutional law should be revised to permit South Dakota to require remote sellers to collect and remit sales tax in South Dakota in accordance with South Dakota’s sales tax statute. Under the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling, the longstanding Quill Corp v. North Dakota sales tax case was overruled, and states may now require remote sellers to collect sales tax under certain circumstances. We began collecting sales tax in relevant jurisdictions for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2019. As a result of this ruling and given the scope of our operations, taxing authorities continue to provide regulations that increase the complexity and risks to comply with such laws and could result in substantial liabilities, prospectively as well as retrospectively. Based on the information available, we continue to evaluate and assess the jurisdictions in which indirect tax nexus exists and believe that the indirect tax liabilities are adequate and reasonable. Due to the complexity and uncertainty around the application of these rules by taxing authorities, results may vary materially from expectations, and 
90
Table 
of Contents
we have recognized liabilities for contingencies related to state sales and use tax, VAT, and GST deemed probable and estimable totaling $
2.9
 million and $
1.0
 million as of January 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively, which is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.
Legal Contingencies
From time to time, in the ordinary course of business, we are or may be involved in various legal or regulatory proceedings, claims or purported class actions related to, among other things, alleged infringement of third-party patents and other intellectual property rights, commercial, labor and employment, wage and hour and other claims. We have been, and may in the future be, put on notice or sued by third-parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights, including patent infringement. We accrue a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We believe we have recorded adequate provisions for any such matters and, as of January 31, 2025, we believe that no material loss will be incurred in excess of the amounts recognized in our financial statements.

Leases
The Company’s lease portfolio consists solely of office space with lease terms ranging from approximately 
one
 to 
ten years
. Certain lease agreements include options to renew or terminate the lease, which are not reasonably certain to be exercised and therefore are not factored into the determination of lease payments.

As of January 31, 2025, we had NOL carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of approximately $
392.3
 million and $
284.2
 million, respectively. Under current law, U.S. federal NOLs incurred in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017 may be carried forward indefinitely, but the deductibility of federal NOLs is limited to 80% of taxable income in tax years beginning after December 31, 2020. Accordingly, $
352.9
 million of our NOLs may be carried forward indefinitely for federal tax purposes and $
39.4
 million, if not utilized, will expire at various times between 2035 and 2037. The majority of state NOLs if not utilized, will expire at various times between 2026 and 2045. We also had foreign NOL carryforwards as of January 31, 2025 of $
32.3
 million, the majority of which may be carried forward indefinitely. As of January 31, 2024, we had NOL carryforwards for federal, state, and foreign income tax purposes of approximately $

 million, the majority of which are related to credits for research activities, and if not utilized, will expire between 2037 and 2045. As of January 31, 2024, the Company has tax credit carryforwards of $
11.9
 million.
IRC Sections 382 and 383 place a limitation on the amount of taxable income that can be offset by carryforward tax attributes, such as net operating losses or tax credits, after a change in control. Generally, after a change in control, a loss corporation cannot deduct carryforward tax attributes in excess of the limitation prescribed by Sections 382 and 383. Therefore, certain of our carryforward tax attributes may be subject to an annual limitation regarding their utilization against taxable income in future periods. As a result of issuances of different classes of preferred stock to investors in 2013, 2014 and 2017, we triggered “ownership shifts” as defined in Internal Revenue Code Section 382 and related provisions. These ownership shifts resulted in a reduction of NOLs in the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021 of $
13.8
 million and credits of $
0.7
 million. Our utilization of our NOLs and credits is limited by these ownership shifts but those limitations do not have a significant impact to the financial statements since there is no utilization of the NOLs and credits and a full valuation allowance exists against the net operating losses and credits. Subsequent ownership changes may subject us to additional annual limitations of its net operating losses. Such annual limitation could result in the expiration of the NOLs and credits.
We determine our valuation allowance on deferred tax assets by considering both positive and negative evidence to ascertain whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will be realized. Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income, if any, the timing, and amount of which are uncertain. Due to our history of losses, we believe that it is not more likely than not that jurisdictions where we have net deferred tax assets can be realized as of January 31, 2025. Accordingly, we have recorded a full valuation allowance against these respective net deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance increased by $
28.4
 million, and $
42.7
 million, during the fiscal years ended January 31, 2025, and 2024, respectively.
The Company has not provided for U.S. federal income and foreign withholding taxes on undistributed earnings from non-U.S. operations as of January 31, 2025 because the Company intends to reinvest such earnings indefinitely outside of the United States. The amount of any unrecognized deferred tax liability related to these earnings would not be material.

The Company recognizes interest and, if applicable, penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the income tax provision. As of January 31, 2025, 2024 and 2023, there were 
no
 interest and penalties recorded.
As of January 31, 2025, 2024 and 2023, accrued unrecognized tax benefits were $

We are subject to income tax examinations in the United States and various state and foreign jurisdictions. Our most significant operations are in the United States and the earliest open tax year subject to potential examination is the period ended January 31, 2022. However, amounts reported as NOLs from these prior tax periods also remain subject to review by most tax authorities.

Net Loss per Share
We compute the basic and diluted net loss per share of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock. The rights, including the liquidation and dividend rights, of the Class A common stock and Class B common stock are substantially identical, other than voting rights. Accordingly, the Class A common stock and Class B common stock share in the Company’s net loss.

Business Combination
Acquisition of North Star Y, Pty Ltd
On June 1, 2023, the Company acquired all the outstanding stock of North Star Y, Pty Ltd (“North Star”), Braze’s exclusive reseller in Australia and New Zealand. The transaction provides Braze with a direct market presence in Australia and New Zealand, along with local market expertise from the North Star team.
The total purchase price consideration, as adjusted, of $
26.8
 million consisted of cash payments of $
20.6
 million, $
6.1
 million in issuances of Braze Class A common stock, and contingent consideration payments, the fair value of which was $
1.8
 million as of the acquisition date. The sellers are eligible to receive cash earn-out payments calculated based on qualified revenue performance metrics for the two individual twelve month periods immediately subsequent to the closing of the acquisition. The earn-out payments are capped at $
10.0
 million for the first earn-out period and $
16.0
 million for the second earn-out period. The fair value measurement of the contingent consideration liability has been influenced by developments in the significant inputs for such calculation, notably the new and incremental actual and forecasted deal closings from the Australia-New Zealand region. As a result, during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025, the Company reduced the contingent consideration liability to 
zero
 as it was determined that the likelihood of the sellers satisfying the qualifications is remote.
The preliminary purchase price, as adjusted, was allocated to intangible assets in the amount of $
3.8
 million and goodwill in the amount of $
28.4
 million based on the respective estimated fair values. The resulting goodwill is not deductible for income tax purposes. 
An indemnification holdback of $
2.8
 million that was previously recorded within accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets was extinguished during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025. The indemnification holdback represents security for potential indemnification claims against the seller. The indemnification holdback was released in full.
Of the initial $
0.5
 million working capital holdback, $
0.3
 million has been released during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025 based on the completion of post-close adjustment procedures. 
The results of operations of North Star, which were not material, have been included in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2025 and 2024.

Segments
Operating segments are defined as components of an entity for which discrete financial information is available that is regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker in deciding how to allocate resources to an individual segment and in assessing performance. Our Chief Executive Officer is the CODM. The Company derives revenues from customers by 
96
Table 
of Contents
providing cloud-based customer engagement platform subscriptions. The Company derives revenue primarily in North America and manages the business activities on a consolidated basis. As such, we have one operating segment, which is the customer engagement platform segment. 
The CODM reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis for purposes of making operating decisions, allocating resources, and evaluating financial performance. Intra-entity activities are eliminated at the consolidated level. The Company’s method for measuring performance on a single operating and reportable segment basis is net loss. Refer to the consolidated statements of operations. In assessing the performance of the business, the CODM regularly reviews consolidated expense information of both historical and forecasted periods to manage operations of the segment (i.e., the consolidated business). 
The CODM reviews assets for Braze’s single reportable segment on a consolidated basis. Refer to the consolidated balance sheets.

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure
None.
Item 9A. Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We maintain “disclosure controls and procedures” (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or Exchange Act), that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms.
Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of January 31, 2025, the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of January 31, 2025 because of the material weakness in our internal control, discussed below.
97
Table 
of Contents
Notwithstanding the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting described below, our management has concluded that our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are fairly stated in all material respects in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
The Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of its internal control over financial reporting based on the framework established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on this evaluation, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that these controls were not effective as of January 31, 2025, due to material weaknesses in the operation of certain key Information Technology General Controls . Consequently, automated and information technology dependent manual business process controls that rely upon information from the information technology systems were also deemed ineffective.
Notwithstanding this material weakness noted above, management has concluded that our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included in this Annual Report fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company as of, and for, the periods presented in this report. Additional detail on the nature of the material weaknesses, and management's conclusions can be found below.
Material Weakness
We identified a material weakness in internal control related to ineffective information technology general controls, or ITGCs, in the areas of user access and program change management over the information technology systems that support our financial reporting processes. Automated and manual controls that rely on system-generated data or reports from the affected information technology environment or process level automated controls in the affected information technology environment were ineffective because they could have been adversely impacted.
Remediation Plan
We have developed a detailed plan for remediation of the material weakness, as well as compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, including:
•
Enhancing controls and procedures over user access and program change management;
•
Strengthening our systems and IT compliance functions through targeted hiring, staff training and implementation of new IT policies; and
•
Engaging an external advisor to assist with control documentation, gap analysis and remediation monitoring.
While we have performed certain remediation activities to strengthen our controls to address the identified material weakness, control weaknesses are not considered remediated until new internal controls have been operational for a period of time, are tested, and management concludes that these controls are operating effectively. 
We will continue to monitor the effectiveness of our remediation measures in connection with our future assessments of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures, and we will make any changes to the design of our plan and take such other actions that we deem appropriate given the circumstances. We expect to complete the remediation process by the end of the fourth quarter of our fiscal year ending January 31, 2026.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Other than the remediation efforts noted above, there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025 that has materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Inherent Limitation on the Effectiveness of Internal Controls
Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls 
98
Table 
of Contents
must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected.
