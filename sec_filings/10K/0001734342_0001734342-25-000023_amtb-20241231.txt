Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
Various of the statements made in this Form 10-K, including information incorporated herein by reference to other documents, are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of, and subject to, the protections of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).
Forward-looking statements include statements with respect to our beliefs, plans, objectives, goals, expectations, anticipations, assumptions, estimates, intentions and future performance and condition, and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, which may be beyond our control, and which may cause the actual results, performance, achievements, or financial condition of the Company to be materially different from future results, performance, achievements, or financial condition expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. You should not expect us to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. These forward-looking statements should be read together with the “Risk Factors” included in this Form 10-K and our other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). 
All statements other than statements of historical fact are statements that could be forward-looking statements. You can identify these forward-looking statements through our use of words such as “may,” “will,” “anticipate,” “assume,” “seek,” “should,” “indicate,” “would,” “believe,” “contemplate,” “consider”, “expect,” “estimate,” “continue,” “plan,” “point to,” “project,” “could,” “intend,” “target”, “goals”, “outlooks”, “modeled”, “dedicated”, “create” and other similar words and expressions of the future. These forward-looking statements may not be realized due to a variety of factors, including, without limitation: 
•
Liquidity risks could affect our operations and jeopardize our financial condition and certain funding sources could increase our interest rate expense;
•
We may not be able to develop and maintain a strong core deposit base or other low-cost funding sources;
•
We may elect or be compelled to seek additional capital in the future, but that capital may not be available when it is needed or on acceptable terms;
•
Our ability to receive dividends from our subsidiaries could affect our liquidity and our ability to pay dividends;
•
Our profitability is subject to interest rate risk; 
•
Our allowance for credit losses may prove inadequate;
•
Our concentration of CRE loans could result in increased loan losses;
•
Many of our loans are to commercial borrowers, which have unique risks compared to other types of loans;
•
Our valuation of securities and the determination of a credit loss allowance in our investment securities portfolio are subjective and, if changed, could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition;
•
Nonperforming and similar assets take significant time to resolve and may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows;
•
We are subject to environmental liability risk associated with lending activities;
•
Weakness in the demand for mortgage loans or in the secondary market for residential mortgage loans can adversely affect us. 
•
Many of our major systems depend on and are operated by third-party vendors, and any systems failures or interruptions could adversely affect our operations and the services we provide to our customers;
•
Our information systems are exposed to cybersecurity threats and may experience interruptions and security breaches that could adversely affect our business and reputation;
•
Our strategic plan and growth strategy may not be achieved as quickly or as fully as we seek;
•
Defaults by or deteriorating asset quality of other financial institutions could adversely affect us;

The rights of our common shareholders are subordinate to the holders of any debt securities that we have issued or may issue from time to time;
•
The stock price of financial institutions, like Amerant, may fluctuate significantly;
•
We can issue additional equity securities, which would lead to dilution of our issued and outstanding Class A common stock;

Certain provisions of our amended and restated articles of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, Florida law, and U.S. banking laws could have anti-takeover effects;
•
We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our debt, including the Subordinated Notes and the Debentures;

The foregoing factors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read together with the other cautionary statements included in this Form 10-K. Because of these risks and other uncertainties, our actual future financial condition, results, performance or achievements, or industry results, may be materially different from the results indicated by the forward-looking statements in this Form 10-K. In addition, our past results of operations are not necessarily indicative of our future results of operations. You should not rely on any forward-looking statements as predictions of future events.
All written or oral forward-looking statements that are made by us or are attributable to us are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary note. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and we do not undertake any obligation to update, revise or correct any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as required by law.

Our Company
We are a bank holding company headquartered in Coral Gables, FL, with $9.9 billion in assets, $7.2 billion in loans held for investment, $7.9 billion in deposits, $890.5 million of shareholders’ equity, and $2.9 billion in assets under management and custody (“AUM”) as of December 31, 2024. We provide individuals and businesses with a comprehensive array of deposit, credit, investment, wealth management, retail banking, mortgage services and fiduciary services. We serve customers in our United States markets and select international customers. These services are offered through Amerant Bank, N.A., or the Bank, which is also headquartered in Coral Gables, FL, and its subsidiaries. Fiduciary, investment, wealth management and mortgage services are provided by the Bank, the Bank’s securities broker-dealer subsidiary, Amerant Investments, Inc., or Amerant Investments, and Amerant Mortgage, LLC, or Amerant Mortgage.
The Bank was founded in 1979. We currently operate 19 banking centers where we offer personal and commercial banking services. The Bank’s primary markets are South Florida, where we are headquartered and operate 18 banking centers in Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties. The Bank also operates one banking center, as well as a regional headquarter office in Tampa, FL. In 2024, we opened new banking centers in downtown Fort Lauderdale, FL and in downtown Miami, FL. We also opened our new regional headquarters office for Broward County, located in Plantation, FL. More recently, we signed a letter of intent for a second banking center in Miami Beach, following the signed agreement we previously announced for our first Miami Beach banking center. One location is expected to open in the first half of 2025, while the other is expected to open in the second half of 2025.  We also signed a letter of intent for our second Tampa banking center location which we expect to open in the second half of 2025. We also expect to open a new regional headquarter office for Palm Beach County, located in West Palm Beach, FL, in the first half of 2025, in addition to opening a new banking center adjacent to our new regional headquarters office there.
Amerant Investments is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”), the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (“SIPC”) and a registered investment adviser with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC. Amerant Investments provides introductory brokerage, investment and transactions services primarily for customers of the Bank. Amerant Mortgage offers a full complement of residential lending solutions including conventional, government, construction, jumbo loans, and other residential lending product offerings.
The Cayman Bank is a bank and trust company domiciled in George Town, Grand Cayman. The Cayman Bank operates under a Cayman Offshore Bank license, or B license, and a Trust license and is supervised by the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority, or CIMA. The Cayman Bank has no staff and its fiduciary services and general administration are provided by the staff of the Bank. The OCC periodically examines the Bank and historically as part of its examination would review the fiduciary relationships and transactions that the Bank managed for the Cayman Bank. We have no foreign offices. The Cayman Bank does not maintain any physical offices in the Cayman Islands and has a registered agent in Grand Cayman as required by applicable regulations. 
The Company is executing a plan for the dissolution of the Cayman Bank and, as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2024, the Cayman Bank no longer had any trust relationships, many of which were transferred to the Bank. The dissolution of the Cayman Bank, is expected to be completed in 2025, once regulatory approval from the applicable regulatory agency is received.
Through the Bank’s subsidiary, CB Reit Holding Corporation, or REIT Hold Co., we maintain a real estate investment trust, CB Real Estate Investments, or REIT, which is taxed as a real estate investment trust. The REIT holds various of the Bank’s real estate loans, and allows the Bank to better manage the Bank’s real estate portfolio.

On August 10, 2018, we completed our spin-off from the Former Parent, or the Spin-off. Our shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock began trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market (“NASDAQ”) on August 13, 2018. 
On December 21, 2018, we completed an initial public offering, the IPO, of 6,300,000 shares of Class A common stock. In January 2019, we sold additional shares of our Class A common stock when the underwriters in the IPO completed the partial exercise of their over-allotment option which was granted in connection with the IPO. 
In November 18, 2021, we completed a clean-up merger resulting in the simplification of our capital structure by automatically converting shares of the Company’s Class B common stock into shares of the Company’s Class A common stock. November 17, 2021 was the last day of trading of the Company’s shares of Class B common stock on NASDAQ after which only the Company’s shares of Class A common stock traded on the NASDAQ under the symbol “AMTB”. 
On August 3, 2023, the Company provided written notice to NASDAQ of its determination to voluntarily withdraw the principal listing of the Company’s Class A common stock, $0.10 par value per share (the “Class A common stock”), from NASDAQ and transfer the listing of the Class A Common Stock to the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”). The Company’s Class A Common Stock listing and trading on NASDAQ ended at market close on August 28, 2023, and trading commenced on the NYSE at market open on August 29, 2023 where it continues to trade under the stock symbol “AMTB”.
 
Our Markets
Our primary market areas are South Florida (Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties), and Tampa, FL. We serve our market areas from our headquarters in Coral Gables, FL and through a network of 18 banking centers throughout South Florida, and 1 located in Tampa, FL. Our subsidiary, Amerant Mortgage, operates its business nationally and has direct access to federal housing agencies.
Business Developments
Public Offering and Securities Repositioning
On September 27, 2024, the Company completed a public offering of 8,684,210 shares of its Class A voting common stock, at a price to the public of $19.00 per share, which included 784,210 shares issued upon the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares of common stock (the “Public Offering”). The total gross proceeds from the offering were approximately $165.0 million, with net proceeds of approximately $155.8 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by the Company. The Company intends to use the net proceeds of the Public Offering for general corporate purposes and to support its continued organic growth, which may include, among other things, working capital, investments in the Bank, resolution of non-performing loans, and potential balance sheet optimization strategies.
Upon successfully completing the Public Offering, the Company initiated a repositioning of the Company’s securities portfolio (the “Securities Repositioning”). The Securities Repositioning consisted of the following actions: (i) transfer at their fair value (which was below their amortized cost) of all of the Company’s debt securities previously classified as held to maturity and carried at amortized cost to the available for sale category; (ii) sale of all corporate notes and subordinated debt; and (iii) sale of all other debt securities classified as available for sale (including those previously classified as held to maturity) with a book yield of less than 2.75%. As a result of the Securities Repositioning, the Company recorded a total pre-tax loss of approximately $76.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2024. The Company completed the Securities Repositioning in October 2024, which resulted in an additional pre-tax loss on sale of approximately $8.1 million. See Note 3 - Securities for additional information on the Company’s securities portfolio.

Sale of Houston Banking Operations
On April 16, 2024, the Bank entered into a Purchase and Assumption Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with MidFirst Bank (“MidFirst”) pursuant to which MidFirst purchased certain assets and assume certain liabilities (the “Houston Sale Transaction”) of the banking operations and six branches in the Houston, Texas metropolitan statistical area (collectively, the “Branches”). Pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement, MidFirst agreed to assume certain deposit liabilities and to acquire certain loans, as well as cash, real property, personal property and other fixed assets associated with the Branches, as well as 45 team members. On July 30,  2024, regulatory approval for the Houston Sale Transaction was received. The Company announced the completion of the Houston Sale Transaction on November 8, 2024.
The purchase price for the purchased assets was computed as the sum of: (a) $13.0 million (the “Deposit Premium”), provided that, if the balance of non-interest checking deposits included in deposits or the total balance of deposits (excluding insured cash sweep deposits) decreased by more than 15% between March 13, 2024 and the closing date, then the Deposit Premium should be equal to the sum of (i) 9.50% of the average daily balance of non-interest checking deposits included in deposits, (ii) 1.85% of the average daily balance of deposits other than non-interest checking deposits, insured cash sweep deposits and time deposits included in deposits, (iii) 0.25% of the average daily balance of insured cash sweep deposits included in Deposits, and (iv) 0.50% of the average daily balance of time deposits included in deposits, with the average daily balance in each case being for the 30-day period ending on the fifth business day prior to closing, provided further, that the Deposit Premium should in no event be lower than $9.25 million, (b) the aggregate amount of cash on hand as of the closing date, (c) the aggregate net book value of all assets being assumed (excluding cash on hand, real property and accrued interest with respect to the loans to be acquired), (d) the appraised value of the real property to be acquired, and (e) accrued interest with respect to the loans to be acquired. The purchase price was subject to a customary post-closing adjustment based on the delivery within 30 calendar days following the closing date of a final closing statement setting forth the purchase price and any necessary adjustment payment amount. The final Deposit Premium was $12.5 million.
In 2024, the Company recorded non-routine expense items in connection with the Houston Sale Transaction totaling approximately $6.8 million as follows: (i) $3.4 million in market value adjustments based on third party appraisals for two banking centers that were owned, ; (ii) $3.1 million in legal, broker fees and other costs, including a loan valuation allowance, and (iii) $0.3 million in intangible asset write-off. These charges were partially offset by a $4.4 million release in credit reserves after transferring the loans to held for sale.

Amerant Mortgage
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had a 100% ownership interest in Amerant Mortgage, respectively. In the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company increased its ownership interest in Amerant Mortgage to 100% from 80%. This transaction had no material impact to the Company’s results of operations in 2023. In connection with the change in ownership interest, which brought the minority interest share to zero at that date, the Company derecognized the equity attributable to noncontrolling interest of $3.8 million at December 31, 2023, with a corresponding reduction to additional paid-in capital.  
 Total mortgage loans held for sale were $42.9 million as of December 31, 2024, compared to $26.2 million at December 31, 2023.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
In 2024, the Company continued to offer its Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) which was approved by shareholders in 2022. The number of shares of Class A common stock issued under the ESPP was 55,407 in 2024 compared to 56,927 in 2023.
The purpose of the ESPP is to provide eligible employees of the Company and its designated subsidiaries with the opportunity to acquire a stock ownership interest in the Company on favorable terms. The ESPP provides for six months offering periods commencing each December 1st and ending on May 31st of the following year and beginning on each June 1st and ending on the following November 30th. Our ESPP permits participating employees to purchase shares of our Class A common stock through payroll deductions of up to 15% of their eligible compensation. Each participating employee is able to purchase a maximum of 5,000 shares of our Class A common stock during an offering period (subject to a limit of $25,000 in fair value of shares of our Class A common stock for each calendar year). The price per share is equal to the lower of 85% of the fair market price on the first trading day of the offering period or 85% of the fair market price on the last trading day of the offering period.
Amerant SPV, LLC
In May 2021, we incorporated Amerant SPV. As we seek to innovate, address customer needs and compete in a fast changing and competitive environment, we evaluate opportunities to partner with fintech and specialty finance companies that are developing cutting edge solutions and products and have the potential to improve our products and services to help our clients achieve their goals in a fast changing world. From time to time, the Company has evaluated select opportunities to invest and acquire non-controlling interests, through Amerant SPV, in companies it partners with, or may acquire non-controlling interests of fintech and specialty finance companies that the Company believes will be strategic or accretive. In addition, through Amerant SPV, we may also invest in companies and funds that invest in  technology companies that are developing solutions aimed at allowing financial institutions and community banks to more effectively compete and serve their customers. At December 31, 2024, the Company’s equity investments through Amerant SPV totaled $8.2 million.

Progress on Strategic Initiatives
Further strengthen the foundation.
 The Company believes that having both the right foundation and the right technology is key to achieve this objective. Our focus is on monetizing the technology ecosystem by improving the ratio of total cost of our technology ecosystem to the revenue generated. We strive for this improvement to be driven primarily by higher revenue, which signals scale and efficiencies obtained through growth. Our commitment to digital enablement has resulted in increases in digital enrollments noted for businesses and individuals. Also, in 2024, we began implementing a framework for monitoring and tracking of strategic initiatives through performance metrics and indicators that we expect to fully implement by year-end 2025.
Relationship-first focus. 
We are focused on seizing opportunities in the markets we serve to increase our share of consumer, small business, and commercial core deposits while reducing our reliance on brokered funds, by implementing a sales excellence culture. Our growth in 2024 was reflective of our deposits-first, organic, relationship-based approach. We generally use our loan-to-deposit ratio and the ratio of non-interest bearing deposits to total deposits to track our progress on our relationship-first strategy. The loan to deposit ratio at December 31, 2024 was 92.6%, compared to 92.0% at December 31, 2023. Also, having completed the conversion, we have been actively reviewing and enhancing our product offering not only for services associated to treasury management but also to deposits and payments.
 
Lastly, those efforts have been accompanied by targeting marketing campaigns focused on increasing brand awareness primarily using our sports partnerships. In 2024, Amerant Bank entered into strategic partnerships and was named the “Official Bank” of the Fort Lauderdale United FC women’s soccer team and the Tampa Bay Rays. These new partnerships have complemented its banking center expansion plans across South and Central Florida and Tampa,  with an extensive program of strategic, multi-year sports partnerships that also include the Miami Marlins, Miami Heat and the Florida Panthers. 
Superior Client Experience and Operational Excellence
. The Company continues to work on optimizing its operating structure to support its business activities, by focusing on activities associated with improving the client’s onboarding and servicing as well as optimizing our banking center channel.
 
In 2024, we opened three banking centers and continue working on expanding our presence in South Florida and Tampa, while continuing to work on providing self-service capabilities to our clients.
Attract, retain & reward the right people. 
In 2024,  we remained committed to developing both internal and external pipelines and aligning incentives to strategic goals to acquire and retain the right people and continue to reward them. We recruited the market presidents for
 
the Tampa, Broward and Palm Beach markets, and also enhanced our business efforts by adding not only a Chief Business Development Officer but also several executives, at different levels, on the commercial and consumer sales teams. We consistently develop our talent through a growth mindset by building on existing skills and providing the right resources and opportunities to ensure early career talent can thrive at Amerant.
Profitably grow the Bank. 
In 2024, we continued to drive organic growth in priority markets. We optimized our international banking structure with the intent to grow international deposits as a source of funds given favorable pricing while also continuing to add diversification to our funding base. As previously mentioned, we recently opened a new banking center in Tampa, FL as part of our ongoing efforts in capturing domestic market share.
 
Also, during 2024, we made significant progress on building a strong foundation to cross the $10 billion assets threshold on a sustained basis in 2025, including enhancements to our existing risk management framework and other initiatives.

ERM and Credit Policies and Procedures
Enterprise Risk Management (“ERM”) is an enterprise-wide approach to risk management, driven from the top by the Board and the Management Risk Committee. This committee establishes the framework and governance structures to enable better understanding of the risk environment, enhance decision making, and ensure adherence to established risk appetite.
The Bank is focused on enhancing the design of the risk management framework to support growth, scalability, and change. We are committed to designing practices that allow us to efficiently adopt to changes and continuously advance our programs.Th is includes strengthening risk identification, risk monitoring, risk reporting, and risk assessment processes, as well as refining our control frameworks. Additionally, we are advancing our capabilities in product and service offerings, technology, consumer compliance, and talent development to meet heightened regulatory and operational demands.
General
. We adhere to what we believe are disciplined underwriting standards. We maintain asset quality through an emphasis on local market knowledge, long-term customer relationships, consistent and thorough underwriting for all loans and a prudent credit culture. We also seek to maintain a broadly diversified loan portfolio across geographies (within Florida or with Florida based sponsors), customers, products and industries. Our lending policies do not provide for any loans that are highly speculative, subprime, or that have high loan-to-value ratios. These components, together with active credit management, are the foundation of our credit culture, which we believe is critical to enhancing the long-term value of our organization to our customers, employees, shareholders and communities. 
Credit Concentrations
. In connection with the management of our credit portfolio, we actively manage the composition of our loan portfolio, including credit concentrations. Our loan approval policies establish concentration limits with respect to industry and loan product type to ensure portfolio diversification, which are reviewed at least annually. The CRE concentration limits include sub-limits by property type and geographic market, which are reviewed semi-annually. Country limits for loans to foreign borrowers are also assessed annually. In general, all concentration levels are monitored on a monthly basis.
Loan Approval Process
. We seek to achieve an appropriate balance between prudent and disciplined underwriting and in our decision-making and timely responsiveness to our customers. As of December 31, 2024, the Bank had a legal lending limit of approximately $144.7 million for unsecured loans, and its “in-house” single obligor lending limit was $35.0 million for CRE loans, representing 24.2% of our legal lending limit and $30.0 million for all other loans, representing 20.7% of our legal lending limit as of such date. Our credit approval policies provide the highest lending authority to our credit committee, as well as various levels of officer and senior management lending authority for new credits and renewals, which are based on position, capability and experience. These limits are reviewed periodically by the Bank’s Board of Directors. We believe that our credit approval process provides for thorough underwriting and sound and efficient decision making.
Credit Risk Management
. We use what we believe is a comprehensive methodology to monitor credit quality and prudently manage credit concentrations within our loan portfolio. Our underwriting policies and practices govern the risk profile and credit and geographic concentration of our loan portfolio. We also have what we believe to be a comprehensive methodology to monitor these credit quality standards, including a risk classification system that identifies possible problem loans based on risk characteristics by loan type as well as the early identification of deterioration at the individual loan level.

Table of

Credit risk management involves a collective effort among our relationship managers and credit underwriting, portfolio management, credit administration, credit risk and Special Assets personnel. We generally conduct weekly credit committee meetings to approve loans at or above $5 million (loans for customers with an aggregate exposure equal to or above $20 million are also considered by the credit committee) and review other relevant credit related matters. 
 
In addition, the credit committee recently created a special assets committee that generally meets twice every month and reviews the non-performing and special mention loan portfolio, with a goal of prudently reducing the levels of these criticized assets. Asset quality trends and delinquencies are also reviewed by the credit committee and reports are elevated to senior management and the Board of Directors. Our policies require rapid notification of delinquency and prompt initiation of collection actions. Relationship managers, credit administration personnel and senior management proactively support collection activities. The variable incentive compensation of our relationship managers is subject to downward adjustment based on the asset quality of each relationship manager’s portfolio. We believe that having the ability to adjust their incentive compensation based on asset quality motivates the relationship managers to focus on the origination and maintenance of high-quality credits consistent with our strategic focus on asset quality.

Deposits
Our deposits serve as the primary funding source for lending, investing and other general banking purposes. We provide a full range of deposit products and services, including a variety of checking and savings accounts, certificates of deposit, money market accounts, debit cards, remote deposit capture, online banking, mobile banking,  and direct deposit services. We also offer business accounts and cash management services, including business checking and savings accounts and treasury management services for our commercial clients. We solicit deposits through our relationship-driven team of dedicated and accessible bankers, through community-focused marketing and, increasingly, through our dedicated national online channel. We also seek to cross-sell deposit and wealth management products and services at loan origination, and loans to our depository and other customers. Our deposits are fully-insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), subject to applicable limits.
 See
 “-Supervision and Regulation.” 
 As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, core deposits were $5.6 billion, and $5.6 billion, 71.6% and 70.9% of our total deposits at those dates, respectively. Our core deposits consist of total deposits excluding all time deposits.
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, time deposits were $2.2 billion and $2.3 billion , 28.4% and 29.1%  of our total deposits at those dates, respectively.
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, brokered deposits were $701.9 million and $736.9 million, 8.9% and 9.3% of our total deposits at those dates, respectively.
Investment, Advisory and Trust Services
We offer a wide variety of trust and estate planning products and services catering to high net worth customers, our trust and estate planning products include simple and complex trusts, private foundations and personal investment companies. 
 The Cayman Bank was originally established to serve a number of our trust and wealth management customers, and developed high net worth international customer relationships with offshore trust and estate planning services. In 2023, the Company approved a plan for the dissolution of the Cayman Bank, and, as of the end of the third quarter of 2024, the Cayman Bank no longer had any trust relationships, many of which were transferred to the Bank. The dissolution of the Cayman Bank is expected to be completed in 2025, once regulatory approval from the applicable regulatory agency is received.
We also offer brokerage and investment advisory services in global capital markets through Amerant Investments. Amerant Investments acts as an introducing broker-dealer through Pershing (a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Bank of New York Mellon) to obtain clearing, custody and other ancillary services.  Amerant Investments offers a wide range of products, including mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, equity securities, fixed income securities, structured products, discretionary portfolio management, margin lending and online equities trading.  Amerant Investments has distribution agreements with many major U.S. and international asset managers, as well as with some focused boutique providers. Amerant Investments provides its services to the Bank’s U.S. domestic and international customers. The Bank’s retail customers are offered non-FDIC insured investment products and services exclusively through Amerant Investments.

Other Products and Services
We offer banking products and services that we believe are attractively priced with a focus on customer convenience and accessibility. We offer a full suite of online banking services including online account opening for domestic and international customers, access to account balances, statements and other documents, Zelle for consumer and businesses, online transfers, online bill payment and electronic delivery of customer statements, as well as automated teller machines (“ATMs”), and banking by mobile devices, telephone and mail. 
We are continuously looking for ways to improve our products, services  and delivery channels. For example, in 2024, in partnership with IntraFi, the Bank launched “CDARS”, a service that allows investors to place large deposits across multiple banks and savings associations while still earning the benefits of a certificate of deposit, covered by the FDIC coverage. Also, we launched “Land Trust”, a legal entity that takes ownership of or authority over a property at the request of the property owner, allowing the management of property while the owner is still alive, making them a convenient and secure solution for real estate holdings.  Lastly, we launched “FedNow Instant Payment” allowing our customers to receive larger payments faster, directly through the Federal Reserve’s FedNow Service, subject to certain limits.
Many of the services provided through our online platform are also available via our mobile application for smart devices. We also offer debit cards, night depositories, direct deposit, cashier’s checks, safe deposit boxes in various locations and letters of credit, as well as treasury management services, including wire transfer services, remote deposit capture and automated clearinghouse services. In addition, we offer other more complex financial products such as derivative instruments, including interest rate swap and cap contracts, to certain lending customers.
Investments
Our investment policy, set by our Board of Directors, requires that investment decisions be made based on, but not limited to, the following four principles: investment quality, liquidity requirements, interest-rate risk sensitivity and estimated return on investment. These characteristics are pillars of our investment decision-making process, which seeks to minimize exposure to risks while providing a reasonable yield and liquidity. Under the direction of the Asset-liability Management Committee (“ALCO”) and senior management, investment in securities are made following specified policy and program guidelines.
Information Technology Systems
As part of our continued efforts to improve our information technology platforms and drive operating efficiency, in the fourth quarter of 2021 the Company entered into a new multi-year outsourcing agreement with financial technology leader FIS to assume full responsibility over a significant number of the Bank’s support functions and staff, including certain back-office operations. The Company completed the transition of its core data processing platform and other applications in the fourth quarter of 2023. We believe these platforms and applications have essential functionalities and scalability to support our continued growth and expansion strategy. Under this outsourcing relationship, the Bank expects to achieve greater operational efficiencies and to deliver advanced solutions and services to its customers. The Bank has developed new internal functions in charge to enhance the third party risk management process and performance for third party providers.

The Bank is actively engaged in identifying and managing cybersecurity risks. Protecting company data, non-public customer and employee data, and the systems that collect, process, and maintain this information is deemed critical. The Bank has an enterprise-wide Information Security Program, or Security Program, which is designed to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of customer non-public information and bank data.
 
The Security Program was also designed to protect our operations and assets through a continuous and comprehensive cybersecurity detection, protection and prevention program. This program includes an information security governance structure and related policies and procedures, security controls, protocols governing data and systems, monitoring processes, and processes to ensure that the information security programs of third-party service providers are adequate. Our Security Program also continuously promotes cybersecurity awareness and culture across the organization. See Section 1C. Cybersecurity for additional information on how we address and manage cybersecurity risks. 
The Bank also has a business continuity/disaster recovery plan, or BCP, which it actively manages to prepare for business continuity challenges it may face. Our BCP provides for the resiliency and recovery of our operations and services to our customers. As part of the third-party risk management process, the Bank ensures that there are specific recovery times for critical platforms. The plan is supported and complemented by a robust business continuity governance framework, a life safety program as well as an enterprise-wide annual exercise and training to keep the program and strategies effective, scalable and understood by all employees. We believe both the Information Security Program and BCP adhere to industry best practices and comply with the guidelines of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, or FFIEC, and are subject to periodic testing and independent audits.

Competition
The banking and financial services industry in our footprint is highly competitive, and we compete with a wide range of lenders and other financial institutions within our markets, including local, regional, national and international commercial banks and credit unions. We also compete with mortgage companies, brokerage firms, trust service providers,  consumer finance companies, mutual funds, securities firms, insurance companies, third-party payment processors, financial technology companies, or fintechs, and other financial intermediaries on various of our products and services. Some of our competitors are not subject to the regulatory restrictions and the level of regulatory supervision applicable to us. Interest rates on loans and deposits, as well as prices on fee-based services, are typically significant competitive factors within the banking and financial services industry. Many of our competitors are much larger financial institutions that have greater financial resources than we do and compete aggressively for market share. These competitors attempt to gain market share through their financial product mix, pricing strategies and larger banking center networks. Other important competitive factors in our industry and markets include office locations and hours, quality of customer service, community reputation, continuity of personnel and services, capacity and willingness to extend credit, electronic delivery systems and ability to offer sophisticated banking products and services. While we seek to remain competitive with respect to fees charged, interest rates and pricing, we believe that our broad and sophisticated banking and financial products suite, our high-quality customer service culture, our positive reputation, brand recognition,  and long-standing community relationships enable us to compete successfully within our markets and enhance our ability to attract and retain customers and employees.
Human Capital Management
The Company’s key human capital management objectives are to attract, retain and develop the right talent. To support these objectives, the Company’s human resources programs are designed to continuously develop talent; reward and support our team members through competitive pay and benefits; enhance the Company’s culture through efforts aimed at making the workplace more engaging and inclusive; and engage team members as brand ambassadors of our products and experiences.
Guided by our precepts, the people at Amerant are committed to providing our customers with the right products, services and advisory services; treating everyone as we expect to be treated; being leaders in innovation, quality, efficiency, and customer satisfaction; consistently exceeding expectations; promoting a diverse and inclusive work environment; holding ourselves and each other accountable; and being the bank of choice in the markets we serve. We believe we have a strong workforce, with a good mix of professional credentials, experience, tenure and diversity, which coupled with their commitment to uncompromising values, provide the foundation for our Company’s success.
The Company’s Human Capital Management includes the following areas of focus:
Talent.
 Attracting, developing, and retaining the best talent with the right skills and values, in accordance with our precepts, is central to our long-term strategy to drive our success.  
Our workforce composition is aligned with our business needs. Management trusts it has adequate human capital to operate its business successfully. The Company and its subsidiaries had 698 full-time equivalent employees, or FTEs, at the end of 2024. Approximately 86% of our workforce is in Florida and 14% in other states, mainly to support our residential mortgage lending activities.

Talent acquisition efforts remained focused on revenue generating and external customer service contact roles, accounting for 43% of all hires. We acquired talent to lead our expansion into the West Palm Beach and greater Tampa markets; and to support the Company’s growth strategy by opening new banking centers in Downtown Miami, and in Downtown Ft. Lauderdale.
 
A key milestone in 2024 was the enhancement of our LinkedIn platform, where we are now able to share stories about the Amerant community, giving our potential candidates a sneak peak of life at Amerant, and a more comprehensive understanding of our organizational structure and the role of each subsidiary. Our talent acquisition team uses internal and external resources to recruit highly skilled and talented workers, and we encourage and reward referrals for open positions. We hire the right person for the job without regard to gender, ethnicity or other protected traits and it is our policy to comply fully with all federal and state laws relating to discrimination in the workplace. 
Learning and Development.
 Our team members are inspired to achieve their full potential through learning and development opportunities, recognition, and motivation. We invest in creating opportunities to help them grow and build their careers through a multitude of learning and development programs. These include online instructor-led and on-the-job learning assignments. Our learning and development strategy is aligned with the Global Association for Talent Development and our business strategy. Understanding that everyone learns differently, we offer various learning options, including traditional classroom, virtual, any-time, mobile, and social collaboration.
In 2024, we continued to empower our team members to reach their full potential by providing diverse learning programs, opportunities, and resources. We used an online talent development tool to provide team members with various learning options, including instructor-led classroom and virtual courses, on-demand recorded sessions and self-paced web-based courses.
 
We also promoted our partnership with Cornerstone Content Anytime and LinkedIn Learning to support our team members' ongoing, ever-changing needs on topics such as leading effectively, overall mental health and well-being, and organizational time management. 
The primary focus for learning in 2024 included supporting the organization in the adoption of our FIS systems, driving a sales culture and supporting leaders in upskilling their ability to lead teams effectively, manage performance and drive change to reach organizational business goals. Additionally, we focused on digital sales enablement by supporting the digital transformation team in driving adoption to our Customer Relationship Management, or CRM, tool, known internally as Harmony.
We delivered over 30,000 learning hours and allocated a learning investment of an average of $1,213.00 per team member in all our learning programs. To support consistency with maintaining learning hours in alignment with industry standards, we launched a partnership with LinkedIn Learning. This partnership will allow team members to complete learning courses on demand based on individualized development needs. 
We also continue offering higher-education tuition cost reimbursement programs, which are aimed at helping our team members put their career goals within reach and provide them with access to a wide variety of degrees and certificates. In 2024 we established a partnership with Barry University which provides our team members an opportunity to complete degrees at a reduced cost.
In alignment with the efforts for learning and development, in 2024 we launched the “Be an Allstar in Your Career” Development program. This program focuses on talent management and ensures we strengthen the organization’s overall capability by identifying the strengths and weaknesses of the organization and ensuring team members are being developed into their future roles. The development plans are heavily focused on meeting the organization’s future needs. To support the Career Development program, we launched Career Development Week. During this week we offered 15 courses, with 295 participants in attendance and 995 dedicated learning hours. 
As we continue in our efforts to develop and promote women, the participants of the Grit and Grace Women’s Development program graduated at the end of 2024. To celebrate their graduation, we hosted a Women’s Development panel to provide opportunities for the graduates to share the knowledge they gained in the program. The program aims to elevate and develop high performing, high potential women, as we continue to prepare talent for the senior leadership bench. We will have a new graduating class in 2025.

Employee engagement.
 To assess and improve retention and engagement, the Company regularly conducts anonymous surveys to seek feedback from our team members on a variety of topics, including but not limited to confidence in company leadership, the competitiveness of our compensation and benefits package, career growth opportunities, and improvements on how we could make our company an employer of choice. 
In 2024 we continued to capture team member sentiments at all stages of the team member’s life cycle, from onboarding to offboarding. We also launched our annual engagement survey. We achieved a 76% engagement score (As per the engagement survey vendor’s thresholds, any score that is above 60% represents extremely high engagement).
In addition to surveying, we spent time on a team member listening tour to capture team members’ thoughts on life at Amerant, including Amerant Culture, Benefits, Learning and Development opportunities, and recognition. These sentiments were shared with the senior management team, and we created an action plan to address the feedback received. All action items related to Career Growth, Increased Communication, Wellness and Camaraderie were completed. Additionally, we worked with teams with low engagement scores to create specific action plans to increase overall engagement. We will launch an engagement pulse survey in 2025 to monitor the effectiveness of our plans.
In addition, for the third year in a row, Amerant was recognized as one of the “America’s Top Most Loved Workplace®” by Newsweek; Amerant is ranked No. 41, up seven spots from the previous year. The 2024 Top 100 Most Loved Workplaces® are the result of a collaboration between Newsweek and the Best Practice Institute (BPI), a leadership development and benchmark research company. The list recognizes companies that have created a workplace where employees feel respected, inspired, and appreciated and are at the center of the business model.
Health and Safety.
 Consistent with our operating principles, the health and safety of our team members is of top priority.  Hazards in the workplace are actively identified and management tracks incidents so remedial actions can be taken to improve workplace safety. 
Impact.
 In 2024, the “I Belong” program, continued launching activities within its strategic roadmap, pillars, and goals. Our four pillars focus on Talent, Workplace, Communication, and Community. 
Our belonging goals are to build teams that reflect the communities we serve while hiring and supporting all talent. The ethnicity of our workforce was 73% Hispanic, 18% White, 3% Black, 2% Asian, and 4% other. Our workforce was 46% male and 54% female at the close of 2024, and women represented 46% of Amerant’s middle management leadership (as classified by Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Category “Middle, First Management Officials”). Over 50% of our workforce is female, and the majority of our workforce self-identifies as Hispanic or Latino. Also, the Bank has a 39% representation of females in senior leadership roles. In addition, the Company’s Board of Directors, which consists of 11 members, currently has 4 female independent directors. Additionally, five of our ten non-executive board members represent diverse backgrounds. 
In alignment with our Talent pillar, the “I Belong” program is focused on attracting early career talent through partnerships with local schools, including Florida International University, Barry University, and Miami Dade College. In 2024 we hosted 5 interns, and the program resulted in all interns being offered continued employment.
As part of our Workplace pillar, educating our team members, increasing the I Belong brand presence, and driving an inclusive environment through our Business Resources Groups were a focus for 2024. The “We Are Multicultural” continued to find opportunities for team members to connect, while sharing best practices to drive inclusion.
As we continue building an inclusive awareness culture, team members were assigned a customized Unconscious Bias course to ensure team members have the skills to recognize and counter biases and people leaders were assigned a course on Inclusive Leadership. 
For over 20 years, we have championed targeted development programs for underrepresented talent in partnership with the Center for Financial Training, a local chapter of the American Bankers Association.

Total Rewards (compensation and benefits).
 We believe in a competitive, total rewards program aligned with our business objectives and the interests of our stakeholders. We remain committed to delivering a compensation program with the fundamental principles of fairness, transparency, efficiency, and compliance with laws and regulations. Based on specific job position and market conditions, our total rewards program combines fixed and variable compensation: base salary, short-term incentive, equity-based long-term incentive, and a broad range of benefits. This compensation approach plays a significant role in our ability to attract, retain and motivate the quality of talent necessary to achieve our strategic business goals and drive sustained performance. As part of our total rewards strategy, the Company offers an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) to team members, which enables team members to purchase Amerant shares at a 15% discount with a look back feature. This plan aligns the interest of our team members with those of our shareholders and fosters a sense of ownership and commitment to the long-term success of the business. Participation in the ESPP is an integral component of our broader compensation and benefits programs.
Our compensation model encourages team members to contribute towards the achievement of shared corporate objectives, while differentiating pay on performance based on individual contributions. In addition to our variable compensation plans, the internal referral incentive programs offer financial rewards for successful referrals, encouraging team members to leverage their networks to bring new clients, business or even the on-boarding of new talent.
Based on our commitment to and knowledge that maintaining fair and transparent compensation principles and a diverse and inclusive culture for our teams has a direct impact on engagement, drive and performance, in 2024, we revamped our Comp-Talk Program though individual sessions with team members to discuss our total rewards model and address their individual positioning, both within the organization and in the broader market. This one-on-one approach fosters a culture of open communication, employee recognition and understanding of future compensation opportunities and growth within the organization.
Wellness:
 As part of the holistic approach to team members’ well-being and our total rewards strategy, the Company takes pride in providing comprehensive health and wellness benefits to our team members and their families. The program is designed to support the physical, mental, and emotional health of our team members. Our wellness initiatives are aimed at encouraging healthy life habits and promoting overall well-being, which we believe are crucial for maintaining a productive and engaging workflow. 
Our benefits package offering includes comprehensive medical, dental, vision, as well as supplemental short and long-term life and out of pocket costs insurance. Along with these benefits we also offer Flexible Spending Accounts (FSA) and Health Savings Accounts (HSA). 
Medical Plans:
 Our comprehensive nationwide healthcare plans allow full-time and part-time team members and their dependents to select from multiple health plan options. The company provides robust health insurance with a wide range of coverage options at competitive medical premiums, including a wellness premium discount when team members complete preventive requirements. The Company contributes up to 92% towards the medical premium depending on the tier chosen and whether wellness requirements have been completed. The Company also contributes $500 towards the HSA accounts at the beginning of each year when the team member has the high deductible medical plan for the team member only coverage, and $1,000 for all other tiers on the high deductible plans. 
Dental, Vision and Legal Plans:
 Full-time and part-time team members are eligible to participate in our dental, vision, and legal plan offerings. The Company contributes up to 100% depending on the plan and chosen tier and provides access to numerous providers across the country. Team members can also choose to purchase out of pocket insurance policies providing income protection and cash for services with five different plans from accident, short term disability, cancer, hospital indemnity, and critical care. The Legal Plan is an attorney owned and operated legal plan offering comprehensive legal assistance, advice, and discounted representation on all types of legal services.
Life, AD&D and Disability:
 Group Basic Life and AD&D Insurance is offered to all full-time and part-time team members, at two times their annual salary with a maximum coverage of $500,000.
 
Team members may choose to purchase additional life insurance up to 5 times their annual salary to a max of $750,000. Full time and part-time team members also benefit from free Short & Long-Term Disability insurance.

Retirement Plans:
 In addition to health insurance benefits, the Company also offers to all team members a pre-tax qualified retirement contribution plan with the Company’s 100% matching contribution up to 5% of a participant’s eligible compensation, and a non-tax qualified retirement contribution plan to certain eligible highly compensated team members. Our total benefits package supports our team member’s well-being to achieve a healthy and financial lifestyle goal.

Sustainability 
 
In 2024, our Impact Program continued to evolve as our sustainability efforts were embedded into our everyday work. We completed a series of activities within the program. On the environmental front, some of those activities included: i) tracking scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions, discussing long-term carbon emission targets, and using greenhouse gas emission offsets to reach our goal of achieving carbon neutrality in 2030. 
We continued to leverage our data management tools in our loan and core systems to code and monitor for Environmentally Conscious Financing (“ECF”). We sponsored Zoo Miami Foundation and Dream in Green. Both programs aim to create educational and environmental impacts for our South Florida Climate. Additionally, we reinforced our recycling efforts at our Amerant Bank operations center by removing all trash bins from cubicles, placing additional recycling bins throughout the location, and educating team members on the proper use of the bins. Lastly, as our Tampa location faced the impacts of Hurricanes Helene and Milton, our team members volunteered on the Gulf Coast in an extensive beach cleanup to restore Tampa Bay shores. 
On the social front, some of those activities included: i) hosting our various Internship Programs in partnership with local colleges and universities in South Florida, which serve as a source of talent; performing team member engagement surveys and internal fair pay gap assessment based on gender; ii) hosting a “Top Women Performers" Program and mandatory online education course on unconscious bias for all team members and inclusive leadership for all people leaders; iii) Additionally, we supported the Ingold Foundation by offering a full-day Financial Literacy program to children in the foster care system, including topics such as the basics of checking, savings and budgeting, credit, identity theft, creating your brand, and navigating your career path; iv) Lastly, as we continue to support our communities, Amerant Bank donated $100,000 on Give Miami Day to organizations, including The Zoo Miami Foundation, Dream in Green, The Everglades Foundation, and Le Jardin Community Center, Inc. On the governance front, some activities included: (i) maintaining women and minority representation on our Board of Directors and (ii) integrating sustainability factors into our procurement and third-party, strategic, and reputational risk frameworks.
In 2024, we continued to advance our Impact Program initiatives and completed a series of activities within the program's scope. Those activities included: i) using our pre-purchased carbon emission offsets to cover our calculated baseline scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions; ii) launching and offering team members an online course on “Sustainability 101” as part of our efforts to sponsor environmentally conscious activities; iii) sponsoring the “Dream in Green” program - the Green Schools Challenge, which engages students in hands-on activities to save energy and water at school and teaches them about the links between natural resources, climate change and community sustainability; and iv) sponsoring the 14th Annual Miami Heat Beach sweep where volunteers planted 500 native plants to support the city of Miami’s target of achieving a robust 30% tree canopy coverage by 2030.
SUPERVISION AND REGULATION
We and the Bank are extensively regulated under U.S. Federal and state laws applicable to financial institutions. Our and the Bank’s supervision, regulation and examination are primarily intended to protect depositors and customers, the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) of the FDIC, and the stability of the U.S. financial system and are not intended to protect our shareholders or debt holders. Any change in applicable law or regulation may have a material effect on our business. The following is a brief summary that does not intend to be a complete description of all regulations that affect the Company and the Bank and this summary  is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statutory and regulatory provisions referred to below.
21
Table of

Bank Holding Company and Bank Regulation
The Company is a bank holding company, subject to supervision, regulation and examination by the Federal Reserve under the Bank Holding Company Act (“BHC Act”). Bank holding companies generally are limited to the business of banking, managing or controlling banks, and certain related activities. We are required to file periodic reports and other information with the Federal Reserve, which examines us and our non-bank subsidiaries.
Bank holding companies that meet certain criteria may elect to become “Financial Holding Companies.” Financial Holding Companies and their subsidiaries are permitted to acquire or engage in activities such as insurance underwriting, securities underwriting, travel agency activities, broad insurance agency activities, merchant banking and other activities that the Federal Reserve determines to be financial in nature or complementary thereto. Financial holding companies continue to be subject to Federal Reserve supervision, regulation and examination. The Company has not elected to become a financial holding company, but it may elect to do so in the future. Bank holding companies that have not elected such treatment generally must limit their activities to banking activities and activities that are closely related to banking.
The Bank is a national bank subject to regulation and regular examinations by the OCC and is a member of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. OCC regulations govern permissible activities, capital requirements, branching, dividend limitations, investments, loans and other matters. 
The Bank is a member of the FDIC’s DIF, and its deposits are insured by the FDIC up to the applicable limits, and, as a result, it is subject to regulation and deposit insurance assessments by the FDIC. 
See
 “FDIC Insurance Assessments”. The FDIC also has backup examination authority and certain enforcement powers over the Bank. 
Under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), the Bank also is subject to regulations issued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”), with respect to consumer financial services and products, but is not subject to direct CFPB supervision or examination because the Bank has less than $10 billion in assets. If the Bank reports assets over $10 billion for four consecutive quarters, it would meet the FDIC’s definition of a “large financial institution” and would be subject to direct supervision by the CFPB for compliance with a variety of consumer compliance laws, and for assessment of the effectiveness of the Bank’s compliance management system. As we began approaching the $10 billion in assets threshold, in the fourth quarter of 2023 we engaged a consulting firm to perform an assessment of our compliance management system and our risk management program to gauge our preparedness to meet the additional regulatory requirements and CFPB supervision that would be applicable to us after surpassing the threshold. The assessment yielded several observations with recommended actions that have been classified and prioritized based on criticality. We began implementing action plans to address these recommendations in 2024 and expect to continue to do so throughout 2025. 
Source of Strength
Federal Reserve policy and federal law, require a bank holding company, such as the Company, to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to its FDIC-insured Bank subsidiary, and to commit resources to support its subsidiary, particularly when such subsidiary is in financial distress. In furtherance of this policy, the Federal Reserve may require a bank holding company to terminate any activity or relinquish control of a non-bank subsidiary (other than a non-bank subsidiary of a bank) upon the Federal Reserve’s determination that such activity or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial soundness or stability of any subsidiary depository institution. Further, federal bank regulatory authorities have additional discretion to require a financial holding company to divest itself of any bank or non-bank subsidiary if the agency determines that divestiture may aid the depository institution’s financial condition.

Change in Control
Federal law limits the amount of voting stock of a bank holding company or a bank that a person may acquire without the prior approval of banking regulators. Under the Change in Bank Control Act (“CBC Act”), and the regulations thereunder, before acquiring control of any bank holding company or any national bank a person or group must give advance notice to the Federal Reserve and the OCC. Upon receipt of such notice, the regulatory agencies may or may not approve the acquisition. The CBC Act creates a rebuttable presumption of control if a person or group acquires the power to vote 10% or more of our outstanding voting common stock. These federal laws and regulations generally make it more difficult to acquire a bank holding company or a bank by tender offer or similar means than it might be to acquire control of another type of corporation. As a result, our shareholders may be less likely to benefit from the rapid increases in stock prices that may result from tender offers or similar efforts to acquire control of other companies. Investors should be aware of these requirements when acquiring our shares of common stock.
Acquisitions
The BHC Act requires prior Federal Reserve approval for, among other things, the acquisition by a bank holding company of direct or indirect ownership or “control” of more than 5% of the voting shares or substantially all the assets of any bank, or for a merger or consolidation of a bank holding company with another bank holding company. The BHC Act permits acquisitions of banks by bank holding companies, subject to various restrictions, including that the acquirer is “well capitalized” and “well managed”. With certain exceptions, the BHC Act prohibits a bank holding company from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or “control” of voting shares of any company that is not a bank or bank holding company and from engaging directly or indirectly in any activity other than banking or managing or controlling banks or performing services for its authorized subsidiaries. However, a bank holding company may engage in or acquire an interest in a company that engages in activities that the Federal Reserve has determined to be so closely related to banking, or managing or controlling banks.
A national bank located in Florida, with the prior approval of the OCC, may acquire and operate one or more banks in other states. In addition, national banks located in Florida may enter into a merger transaction with one or more out-of-state banks, and an out-of-state bank resulting from such transaction may continue to operate the acquired branches in Florida. Under the Bank Merger Act, prior OCC approval is required for a national bank to merge or consolidate with, or purchase the assets or assume the deposits of, another bank. In reviewing applications to approve mergers and other acquisition transactions, the OCC is required to consider factors similar to the Federal Reserve under the BHC Act, including the applicant’s financial and managerial resources, competitive effects and public benefits of the transaction, the applicant’s performance in meeting community needs, and the effectiveness of the entities in combating money laundering activities. The Dodd-Frank Act permits banks, including national banks, to branch anywhere in the United States.
Governance and Financial Reporting Obligations
We are required to comply with various corporate governance and financial reporting requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“SOX Act”), as well as rules and regulations adopted by the SEC, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”), and the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”). In particular, in order to comply with Section 404 of the SOX Act, we are required to include management’s report on internal controls as part of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as our independent registered public accounting firm’s report on internal controls. The assessments of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 are included in this report under “Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.”

Shareholder Say-On-Pay Votes
Under the Dodd-Frank Act public companies are required to provide shareholders with an advisory vote on executive compensation (known as say-on-pay votes), the frequency of a say-on-pay vote, and the golden parachutes available to executives in connection with change-in-control transactions. Public companies must give shareholders the opportunity to vote on say-on-pay proposals at least every three years and the opportunity to vote on the frequency of say-on-pay votes at least every six years, indicating whether the say-on-pay vote should be held annually, biennially, or triennially. Prior to 2022 as an EGC, the Company was not required to comply with these provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Company began complying with these provisions in 2022, after it exited its EGC status. Since then, the Company provides its shareholders with the opportunity to vote on say-on-pay proposals every year. 
Volcker Rule
The “Volcker Rule” issued under the Dodd-Frank Act, which became effective in July 2015, generally prohibits banking organizations with over $10 billion in assets from (i) engaging in certain types of proprietary trading, and (ii) acquiring or retaining an ownership interest in or sponsoring a “covered fund,” all subject to certain exceptions. The Volcker Rule also details certain limited activities in which bank holding companies and their subsidiaries may continue to engage and requires banking organizations to implement compliance programs. In 2020, amendments to the proprietary trading and covered funds regulations took effect, simplifying compliance and providing additional exclusions and exemptions. Given our asset size, we and the Bank were not subject to the Volcker Rule in 2024, but may become so in the future.
Transactions with Affiliates and Insiders
Pursuant to Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, and Federal Reserve Regulation W thereunder, the Bank is subject to restrictions that limit certain types of transactions between the Bank and its non-bank affiliates. In general, U.S. banks are subject to quantitative and qualitative limits on extensions of credit, purchases of assets and certain other transactions involving its non-bank affiliates. Additionally, transactions between U.S. banks and their non-bank affiliates are required to be on arm’s length terms and must be consistent with standards of safety and soundness.
Reserves
The Federal Reserve requires all depository institutions, such as the Bank, to maintain reserves against transaction accounts (primarily noninterest-bearing and Negotiable Orders of Withdrawal, or NOW, checking accounts). Effective March 26, 2020, the Federal Reserve reduced reserve requirement ratios to zero percent, effectively eliminating reserve requirements for all depository institutions. These reserve requirements are subject to annual adjustment by the Federal Reserve.

Privacy and Data Security
A variety of federal and state privacy laws govern the collection, safeguarding, sharing and use of customer information, and require that financial institutions have policies regarding information privacy and security. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLB Act”), and related regulations require banks and their affiliated companies to adopt and disclose privacy policies, including policies regarding the sharing of personal information with third-parties. Some state laws also protect the privacy of information of state residents and require adequate security of such data, and certain state laws may, in some circumstances, require us to notify affected individuals of security breaches of computer databases that contain their personal information. These laws may also require us to notify law enforcement, regulators or consumer reporting agencies in the event of a data breach, as well as businesses and governmental agencies that own data. See Section 1C. Cybersecurity for  information on how we address and manage cybersecurity risks. 
Community Reinvestment Act and Consumer Laws
The Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”) and its corresponding regulations are intended to encourage banks to help meet the credit needs of the communities they serve, including low and moderate income neighborhoods, consistent with safe and sound banking practices. These regulations provide for regulatory assessment of a bank’s record in meeting the credit needs of its market area. Federal banking agencies are required to publicly disclose each bank’s rating under the CRA. The OCC considers a bank’s CRA rating when the bank submits an application to establish bank branches, merge with another bank, or acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of another bank. In the case of a bank holding company or financial holding company, the Federal Reserve reviews the CRA performance record in connection with the application to acquire ownership or control of shares of a bank holding company. An unsatisfactory record can substantially delay or block the transaction. The Bank has received an “outstanding” rating since 2000, including its most recent CRA evaluation completed in 2022.
On October 24, 2023, the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, and the OCC issued a final rule amending the agencies’ CRA regulations. In developing the final rule, the agencies’ objectives included updating the CRA regulations to strengthen the achievement of the core purpose of the statute, and adapting to changes in the banking industry, including the expanded role of mobile and online banking. Most of the final rule’s new requirements are applicable beginning January 1, 2026. The remaining new requirements, including data reporting requirements, are applicable on January 1, 2027. We continue to evaluate the impact of any CRA changes and their impact to our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity, which cannot be predicted at this time.
The Bank is also subject to, among other things, other federal and state consumer laws and regulations that are designed to protect consumers in transactions with banks. While the list set forth below is not exhaustive, these laws and regulations include the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, and, as applicable, their implementing regulations (i.e., Regulations B, C, E, V, X, Z, CC, and DD among others). These laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with clients when taking deposits, making loans processing checks or certain electronic payments, and collecting consumer debts. The Bank must comply with the applicable provisions of these consumer protection laws and regulations as part of its ongoing client relations.
The CFPB has the authority over many consumer financial protection laws, and is authorized to adopt regulations with respect to the same. Although the CFPB does not examine or supervise banks with less than $10 billion in assets, it exercises broad authority in making rules and providing guidance that affects bank regulation in these areas and the scope of bank regulators’ consumer regulation, examination and enforcement. Banks of all sizes are affected by the CFPB’s regulations, and the precedents set by CFPB enforcement actions and interpretations. The CFPB has focused on various practices to date, including revising mortgage lending rules, overdrafts, credit card add-on products, indirect automobile lending, student lending, and payday and similar short-term lending, and has a broad mandate to regulate consumer financial products and services, whether or not offered by banks or their affiliates. As of the date of this 10-K, the current administration has instructed CFPB employees to "not perform any work tasks"

and "cease all supervision and examination activity."
 
It is unclear whether this directive is temporary or will result in permanent changes to the CFPB's regulatory and enforcement authority or how it will impact banks and bank holding companies. In the meantime, existing laws remain in effect.
 
We expect the OCC to continue to examine the Bank for compliance with these laws. 
 
Standards for Safety and Soundness
The Federal Deposit Insurance Act requires the federal bank regulatory agencies to prescribe, by regulation or guideline, operational and managerial standards for all insured depository institutions relating to: (1) internal controls; (2) information systems and audit systems; (3) loan documentation; (4) credit underwriting; (5) interest rate risk exposure; and (6) asset quality. The federal banking agencies have adopted regulations and Interagency Guidelines Establishing Standards for Safety and Soundness to implement these required standards. These guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards used to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. Under the regulations, if a regulator determines that a bank fails to meet any standards prescribed by the guidelines, the regulator may require the bank to submit an acceptable plan to achieve compliance, consistent with deadlines for the submission and review of such safety and soundness compliance plans.
Anti-money Laundering
 
The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (the “USA Patriot Act”), provides the federal government with additional powers to address terrorist threats through enhanced domestic security measures, expanded surveillance powers, increased information sharing and broadened anti-money laundering requirements. By way of amendments to the Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”), the USA Patriot Act puts in place measures intended to encourage information sharing among bank regulatory and law enforcement agencies. In addition, certain provisions of the USA Patriot Act impose affirmative obligations on a broad range of financial institutions.
The USA Patriot Act, the BSA and related federal regulations require banks to establish anti-money laundering programs that include policies, procedures and controls to detect, prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing and to verify the identity of their customers and of beneficial owners of their legal entity customers. 
The Anti-Money Laundering Act ("AMLA"), which amends the BSA, was enacted in early 2021. The AMLA is intended to be a comprehensive reform and modernization of U.S. bank secrecy and anti-money laundering laws. In particular, it codifies a risk-based approach to anti-money laundering compliance for financial institutions, requires the U.S. Department of the Treasury to promulgate priorities for anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism policy, requires the development of standards for testing technology and internal processes for BSA compliance, expands enforcement- and investigation-related authority (including increasing available sanctions for certain BSA violations), and expands BSA whistleblower incentives and protections. 
Many AMLA provisions will require additional rulemakings, reports and other measures, and the impact of the AMLA will depend on, among other things, rulemaking and implementation guidance. In June 2021, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”), a bureau of the U.S. Department of the Treasury, issued the priorities for anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism policy required under the AMLA. The priorities include corruption, cybercrime, terrorist financing, fraud, transnational crime, drug trafficking, human trafficking and proliferation financing.
In addition, South Florida has been designated as a High Intensity Financial Crime Area (“HIFCA”), by FinCEN and a High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area (“HIDTA”), by the Office of National Drug Control Policy. The HIFCA program is intended to concentrate law enforcement efforts to combat money laundering efforts in higher-risk areas. The HIDTA designation makes it possible for local agencies to benefit from ongoing HIDTA-coordinated program initiatives that are working to reduce drug use.

There is also increased scrutiny of compliance with the sanctions programs and rules administered and enforced by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) of the U.S. Department of Treasury. OFAC administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions against targeted foreign countries and regimes, terrorists, international narcotics traffickers, those engaged in activities related to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and other threats to the national security, foreign policy or economy of the United States, based on U.S. foreign policy and national security goals. OFAC issues regulations that restrict transactions by U.S. persons or entities (including banks), located in the U.S. or abroad, with certain foreign countries, their nationals or “specially designated nationals.” OFAC regularly publishes listings of foreign countries and designated nationals that are prohibited from conducting business with any U.S. entity or individual. While OFAC is responsible for promulgating, developing and administering these controls and sanctions, all of the bank regulatory agencies are responsible for ensuring that financial institutions comply with these regulations.
Lending Practices
Federal bank regulatory guidance titled “Concentrations in Commercial Real Estate Lending, Sound Risk Management Practices” (the “CRE Guidance”) requires that appropriate processes be in place to identify, monitor and control risks associated with real estate lending concentrations. This could include enhanced strategic planning, CRE underwriting policies, risk management, internal controls, portfolio stress testing and risk exposure limits as well as appropriately designed compensation and incentive programs. Higher allowances for loan losses and capital levels may also be required. The CRE Guidance provides the following criteria regulatory agencies will use as indicators to identify institutions that may be exposed to CRE concentration risk: (i) experienced rapid growth in CRE lending; (ii) notable exposure to a specific type of CRE; (iii) Total reported loans for construction, land development, and other land of 100% or more of a bank’s total risk-based capital; or (iv) Total commercial real estate, which includes  loans secured by multifamily and nonfarm nonresidential properties and loans for construction, land development, and other land are 300% or more of a bank’s total risk-based capital and the outstanding balance of the institutions’ CRE portfolio has increased by 50% or more during the prior 36 months. We have always had significant exposures to loans secured by CRE due to the nature of our markets. We believe our long term experience in CRE lending, underwriting policies, internal controls, and other policies currently in place, as well as our loan and credit monitoring and administration procedures, are generally appropriate to manage our concentrations as required under the guidance.
Federal law limits a bank's authority to extend credit to directors and executive officers of the bank or its affiliates and persons or companies that own, control or have power to vote more than 10% of any class of securities of a bank or an affiliate of a bank, as well as to entities controlled by such persons. Among other things, extensions of credit to insiders are required to be made on terms that are substantially the same as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons. Also, the terms of such extensions of credit may not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features and may not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons, individually and in the aggregate, which limits are based, in part, on the amount of the bank's capital.

Debit Interchange Fees
 
Interchange fees are fees that merchants pay to card companies and card-issuing banks such as the Bank for processing electronic payment transactions on their behalf. The “Durbin Amendment” in the Dodd-Frank Act provides limits on the amount of debit card interchange that may be received or charged by the debit card issuer, for insured depository institutions with $10 billion or more in assets (inclusive of affiliates) as of the end of the calendar year. Subject to certain exemptions and potential adjustments, the Durbin Amendment limits debit card interchange received or charged by the issuer to $0.21 plus 5 basis points multiplied by the value of the transaction. Upon crossing the $10 billion asset threshold in a calendar year, the rules require compliance with these limits by no later than July 1 of the following year. The Bank did not exceed the $10 billion asset threshold at the end of 2024, but may exceed this threshold in 2025. If so, the Company's compliance with the provisions of the Durbin amendment would be required no later than July 1, 2026, and we do not expect the limits to debit card interchange to materially reduce the Company's revenue.
Payment of Dividends and Repurchases
We and the Bank are subject to various general regulatory policies and requirements relating to the payment of dividends, including requirements to maintain capital above regulatory minimums. The Federal Reserve and the OCC are authorized to determine when the payment of dividends by the Company and the Bank, respectively, would be an unsafe or unsound practice, and may prohibit such dividends. The Federal Reserve and the OCC have indicated that paying dividends that deplete a bank’s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice. The Federal Reserve and the OCC have each indicated that depository institutions and their holding companies should generally pay dividends only out of current year’s operating earnings.
A bank holding company must give the Federal Reserve prior notice of any purchase or redemption of its equity securities if the consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the consideration for all such purchases or redemptions in the preceding 12 months, is equal to 10% or more of its consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would be an unsafe or unsound practice or would violate any law, regulation, Federal Reserve order, or condition imposed in writing by the Federal Reserve. This notification requirement does not apply to a bank holding company that qualifies as well-capitalized, received a composite rating and a rating for management of “1” or “2” in its last examination and is not subject to any unresolved supervisory issue.
The Basel III Capital Rules, which we discuss below, further limit our permissible dividends, stock repurchases and discretionary bonuses, including those of the Bank, unless we and the Bank continue to meet the fully phased-in capital conservation buffer requirement. The Company and the Bank exceeded the capital conservation requirement at year end 2024. 
See 
“Capital Requirements”.
Under Florida law, the Company may only pay dividends if, after giving effect to each dividend, the Company would be able to pay its debts as they become due and the Company’s total assets would exceed the sum of its total liabilities plus the amount that would be needed, if the Company were to be dissolved at the time of each dividend, to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of shareholders whose preferential rights are superior to those entitled to receive the dividend.

Capital Requirements
We and the Bank are required under federal law to maintain certain minimum capital levels based on ratios of capital to assets and capital to risk-weighted assets. The required capital ratios are minimums, and the Federal Reserve and OCC may determine that a banking organization, based on its size, complexity or risk profile, must maintain a higher level of capital in order to operate in a safe and sound manner. Risks such as concentration of credit risks and the risk arising from non-traditional activities, as well as the institution’s exposure to a decline in the economic value of its capital due to changes in interest rates, and an institution’s ability to manage those risks are important factors that are to be taken into account by the federal banking agencies in assessing an institution’s overall capital adequacy. The following is a brief description of the relevant provisions of these capital rules and their potential impact on our and the Bank's capital levels. The relevant capital measures are the total risk-based capital ratio, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, common equity Tier 1 or “CET1” capital ratio, as well as, the leverage capital ratio.
The Federal Reserve has risk-based capital rules for bank holding companies and the OCC has similar rules for national banks. These rules require a minimum ratio of capital to risk-weighted assets (including certain off-balance sheet activities, such as standby letters of credit) and capital conservation buffer of 10.50%. Tier 1 capital includes common equity and related retained earnings and a limited amount of qualifying preferred stock, less goodwill and certain core deposit intangibles. Voting common equity must be the predominant form of capital. Tier 2 capital consists of non-qualifying preferred stock, qualifying subordinated, perpetual, and/or mandatory convertible debt, term subordinated debt and intermediate term preferred stock, up to 45% of pre-tax unrealized holding gains on available for sale equity securities with readily determinable market values that are prudently valued, and a loan loss allowance up to 1.25% of its standardized total risk-weighted assets, excluding the allowance. The capital rules also define the risk-weights assigned to assets and off-balance sheet items to determine the risk-weighted asset components of the risk-based capital rules, including, for example, “high volatility” commercial real estate, past due assets, structured securities and equity holdings. We collectively refer to Tier 1 risk based capital and Tier 2 capital as Total risk-based capital.
In addition, the Federal Reserve has established minimum leverage ratio guidelines for bank holding companies, which provide for a minimum leverage ratio of Tier 1 capital to adjusted average quarterly assets (“leverage ratio”) equal to 4%. However, regulators expect bank holding companies and banks to operate with leverage ratios above the minimum. The guidelines also provide that institutions experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions will be expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels without significant reliance on intangible assets. The Federal Reserve has indicated that it will continue to consider a “tangible Tier 1 leverage ratio” (deducting all intangibles) in evaluating proposals for expansion or new activity. Higher capital may be required in individual cases and depending upon a bank holding company’s risk profile. All bank holding companies and banks are expected to hold capital commensurate with the level and nature of their risks, including the volume and severity of their problem loans. The level of Tier 1 capital to risk-adjusted assets is becoming more widely used by the bank regulators to measure capital adequacy. Neither the Federal Reserve nor the OCC has advised us of any specific minimum leverage ratio or tangible Tier 1 leverage ratio applicable to the Company or the Bank, respectively. Under Federal Reserve policies, bank holding companies are generally expected to operate with capital positions well above the minimum ratios. The Federal Reserve believes the risk-based ratios do not fully take into account the quality of capital and interest rate, liquidity, market and operational risks. Accordingly, supervisory assessments of capital adequacy may differ significantly from conclusions based solely on the level of an organization’s risk-based capital ratio.
In order to avoid certain restrictions on permissible dividends, stock repurchases and discretionary bonuses, a minimum “capital conservation buffer” of CET1 capital of at least 2.5% of total risk-weighted assets, is required. The capital conservation buffer is calculated as the lowest of: (i) the banking organization’s CET1 capital ratio minus 4.5%; (ii) the banking organization’s Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio minus 6.0%; or (iii) the banking organization’s total risk-based capital ratio minus 8.0%.

The Federal Reserve, the OCC, and the FDIC, published a final rule on July 22, 2019 (“the Capital Simplifications Final Rule”) that simplifies existing regulatory capital rules for non-advanced approaches institutions, such as the Company. Non-advanced approaches institutions were permitted to implement the Capital Simplifications Final Rule as of its revised effective date in the quarter beginning January 1, 2020, or wait until the quarter beginning April 1, 2020. As of the date of implementation, the required deductions from regulatory capital CET1 elements for mortgage servicing assets (“MSAs”) and temporary difference deferred tax assets (“DTAs”) are only required to the extent these assets exceed 25% of CET1 capital elements, less any adjustments and deductions (the “CET1 Deduction Threshold”). MSAs and temporary difference DTAs that are not deducted from capital are assigned a 250% risk weight. Investments in the capital instruments of unconsolidated financial institutions are deducted from capital when these exceed the 25% CET1 Deduction Threshold. Minority interests in up to 10% of the parent banking organization’s CET1, Tier capital and total capital, after deductions and adjustments are permitted to be included in capital effective October 1, 2019. Also, effective October 1, 2019, the final rule made various technical amendments, including reconciling a difference in the capital rules and the bank holding company rules that permits the redemption of bank holding company common stock without prior Federal Reserve approval under the capital rules. Such redemptions remain subject to other requirements, including the BHC Act and Federal Reserve Regulation Y. The Company adopted these simplified capital rules in the first quarter of 2020 and they had no material effect on the Company’s regulatory capital and ratios.
The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision published the last version of the Basel III accord in 2017, generally referred to as “Basel IV.” The Basel Committee stated that a key objective of the revisions incorporated into the framework is to reduce excessive variability of risk-weighted assets, which will be accomplished by enhancing the robustness and risk sensitivity of the standardized approaches for credit risk and operational risk. This will facilitate the comparability of banks’ capital ratios, constraining the use of internally modeled approaches, and complementing the risk-weighted capital ratio with a finalized leverage ratio and a revised and robust capital floor. Leadership of the Federal Reserve, OCC, and FDIC, who are tasked with implementing Basel IV, supported the revisions. Under the current U.S. capital rules, operational risk capital requirements and a capital floor apply only to advanced approaches institutions, and not to us. The impact of Basel IV on us will depend on the manner in which it is implemented by the federal bank regulators.
      As of December 31, 2024, the Company’s and the Bank's CET1 ratio were 11.21% and 11.73%, respectively.  In addition, the Company’s and the Bank’s total risk-based capital ratio as of December 31, 2024 were 13.43% and 12.84%, respectively. As a result, both the Company and the Bank are currently classified as "well-capitalized" for purposes of the OCC's prompt corrective action regulations.

Prompt Corrective Action Rules
The federal banking agencies are required to take "prompt corrective action" with respect to financial institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. The law establishes five categories for this purpose: "well-capitalized," "adequately capitalized," "undercapitalized," "significantly undercapitalized" and "critically undercapitalized." To be considered "well-capitalized," an insured depository institution must maintain minimum capital ratios and must not be subject to any order or written directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. To be well-capitalized, the Bank must maintain at least the following capital ratios:
•
10.0% Total capital to risk-weighted assets
•
8.0% Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted asset
•
6.5% CET1 to risk-weighted assets; and
•
5.0% leverage ratio.
An institution that fails to remain well-capitalized becomes subject to a series of restrictions that increase in severity as its capital condition weakens. Such restrictions may include a prohibition on capital distributions, restrictions on asset growth or restrictions on the ability to receive regulatory approval of applications. The regulations apply only to banks and not to BHCs. However, the Federal Reserve is authorized to take appropriate action at the holding company level, based on the undercapitalized status of the holding company's subsidiary banking institutions. In certain instances, relating to an undercapitalized banking institution, the BHC would be required to guarantee the performance of the undercapitalized subsidiary's capital restoration plan and could be liable for civil money damages for failure to fulfill those guarantee commitments.
In addition, failure to meet capital requirements may cause an institution to be directed to raise additional capital. Federal law further mandates that the agencies adopt safety and soundness standards generally relating to operations and management, asset quality and executive compensation, and authorizes administrative action against an institution that fails to meet such standards. Failure to meet capital guidelines may subject a banking organization to a variety of other enforcement remedies, including additional substantial restrictions on its operations and activities, termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC and, under certain conditions, the appointment of a conservator or receiver.
Enforcement Policies and Actions
The Federal Reserve and the OCC monitor compliance with laws and regulations. The CFPB monitors compliance with laws and regulations applicable to consumer financial products and services. Violations of laws and regulations, or other unsafe and unsound practices, may result in these agencies imposing fines, penalties and/or restitution, cease and desist orders, or taking other formal or informal enforcement actions. Under certain circumstances, these agencies may enforce similar remedies directly against officers, directors, employees and others participating in the affairs of a bank or bank holding company, including fines, penalties and the recovery, or claw-back, of compensation.

FDIC Insurance Assessments
Deposits at U.S. domiciled banks are insured by the FDIC, subject to limits and conditions of applicable laws and regulations. Our deposit accounts are insured by the DIF generally up to a maximum of  $250,000 per separately insured depositor and for each account ownership category. In order to fund the DIF, all insured depository institutions are required to pay quarterly assessments to the FDIC that are based on an institutions assignment to one of four risk categories based on supervisory evaluations, regulatory capital levels and certain other factors. The FDIC has the discretion to adjust an institution’s risk rating and may terminate its insurance of deposits upon a finding that the institution engaged or is engaging in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC or written agreement entered into with the FDIC. The FDIC may also prohibit any FDIC-insured institution from engaging in any activity it determines to pose a serious risk to the DIF.
London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (LIBOR) Cessation and Replacement Rates
The Company owns all of the common capital securities issued by five statutory trust subsidiaries (“the Trust Subsidiaries”), respectively. These Trust Subsidiaries were first formed by the Company for the purpose of issuing trust preferred securities (“the Trust Preferred Securities”) and investing the proceeds in junior subordinated debentures issued by the Company (the “Debentures”). The Debentures are guaranteed by the Company. The Trust Preferred Securities and the Debentures issued by the Company originally included calculations that were based on 3-month LIBOR, on June 30, 2023, the 3-month LIBOR was discontinued in accordance with the LIBOR Act. As of June 30, 2023, the 3-month LIBOR, as used in the Trust Preferred Securities and Debentures documents, was replaced with the 3-month CME term secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) as adjusted by the relevant spread adjustment of 0.26161%.
Lender Net Worth Adjusted Requirements 
Amerant Mortgage is currently an approved seller and servicer with Fannie Mae for the purpose of selling Fannie Mae eligible loan production and retaining the Mortgage Servicing Rights, or MSRs, of those same loans. As an approved Fannie Mae seller and servicer, Amerant Mortgage must meet certain net worth covenants outlined in the Maintaining Seller/Servicer Eligibility section of the Fannie Mae Selling Guide (the “Selling Guide”).
Under the Selling Guide, Amerant Mortgage must meet a minimum net worth requirement of $2.5 million plus 0.25% of the outstanding unpaid principal balance of the portfolio of loans Amerant Mortgage is contractually obligated to service for Fannie Mae (the “Lender Adjusted Net Worth”). Failure to meet the minimum net worth or net worth decline tolerance outlined above, may prompt the suspension of Amerant Mortgage as an approved seller and/or servicer, which would prevent Amerant Mortgage from taking down new commitments to deliver loans to Fannie Mae and adding loans to any portfolio that Amerant Mortgage services for Fannie Mae.

Cybersecurity Regulations and Guidelines
The federal banking regulators regularly issue new guidance and standards, and update existing guidance and standards, regarding cybersecurity, which are intended to enhance cyber risk management by financial institutions. Financial institutions are expected to comply with such guidance and standards and to accordingly develop appropriate security controls and risk management processes. If we fail to observe this regulatory guidance or standards, we could be subject to various regulatory sanctions, including financial penalties. 
Since May 2022, a rule adopted by the federal banking agencies requires banking organizations to notify their primary banking regulator within 36 hours of determining that a "computer-security incident" has materially disrupted or degraded, or is reasonably likely to materially disrupt or degrade, the banking organization's ability to carry out banking operations or deliver banking products and services to a material portion of its customer base, its businesses and operations that would result in material loss, or its operations that would impact the stability of the United States.
In December 2023, new SEC rules became effective that require public companies, among other things, to report material cybersecurity incidents in current reports on Form 8-K. The new rules also require reporting about a public company’s policies and procedures to identify and manage cybersecurity risks; as well as disclosure about the Board of Directors' oversight of cybersecurity risk; and management’s role and expertise in assessing and managing cybersecurity risk and implementing cybersecurity policies and procedures. 
State regulators have also been increasingly active in implementing privacy and cybersecurity standards and regulations. Recently, several states have adopted regulations requiring certain financial institutions to implement cybersecurity programs and providing detailed requirements with respect to these programs, including data encryption requirements. Many states have also recently implemented or modified their data breach notification, information security and data privacy requirements. We expect this trend of state-level activity in those areas to continue and are continually monitoring developments where our customers are located. 
Risks and exposures related to cybersecurity attacks, including litigation and enforcement risks, are expected to be elevated for the foreseeable future due to the rapidly evolving nature and sophistication of these threats, as well as due to the expanding use of Internet banking, mobile banking and other technology-based products and services by us and our customers. 
See 
Item 1A. Risk Factors for a further discussion of risks related to cybersecurity and Item 1c. Cybersecurity for further information on how we address and manage cybersecurity risks .
Future Legislative Developments
Congress may enact legislation from time to time that affects the regulation of the financial services industry, and state legislatures may enact legislation from time to time affecting the regulation of financial institutions chartered by or operating in their states. Federal and state regulatory agencies also periodically propose and adopt changes to their regulations or change the manner in which existing regulations are applied. The substance or impact of pending or future legislation or regulation, or the application thereof, cannot be predicted, although any change could impact the regulatory structure under which we or our competitors operate and may significantly increase costs, impede the efficiency of internal business processes, require an increase in regulatory capital, require modifications to our business strategy, and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities in an efficient manner. It could also affect our competitors differently than us, including in a manner that would make them more or less competitive. A change in statutes, regulations or regulatory policies applicable to us or any of our affiliates could have a material, adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Item 1A. RISK FACTORS
We are subject to risks and uncertainties that could potentially negatively impact our business, financial conditions, results of operations and cash flows. In evaluating us and our business and making or continuing an investment in our securities, you should carefully consider the risks described below as well as other information contained in this Form 10-K and any risk factors and uncertainties discussed in our other public filings with the SEC under the caption “Risk Factors”. We may face other risks that are not contained in this Form 10-K, including additional risks that are not presently known, or that we presently deem immaterial. This Form 10-K and the risks discussed below also include forward-looking statements, and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in such forward-looking statements. Please refer to the section in this Form 10-K titled “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” for additional information regarding forward-looking statements. 
Risks related to Funding and Liquidity 
Liquidity risks could affect our operations and jeopardize our financial condition and certain funding sources could increase our interest rate expense.
Liquidity is essential to our business. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, proceeds from loan repayments or sales, and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity. Our funding sources include deposits (core and non-core), federal funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements, short-and long-term debt, the Federal Reserve Discount Window (Discount Window) and Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta, or FHLB, advances. We also maintain a portfolio of securities that can be used as a source of liquidity.
 A substantial portion of our liabilities consist of deposit accounts that are payable on demand or upon several days' notice, including deposit accounts from Large Fund Providers (third-party customer relationships with balances of over $20 million). We also use brokered deposits and wholesale funding, which not only increases our liquidity risk but could also increase our interest rate expense and potentially increase our deposit insurance costs. Institutions that are less than well-capitalized may be unable to raise or renew brokered deposits under the prompt corrective action rules. 
See 
“Supervision and Regulation—Capital Requirements” in the Form 10-K.
Any significant restriction or disruption of our ability to obtain funding from these or other sources could have a negative effect on our ability to satisfy our current and future financial obligations, which could materially affect our financial condition or results of operations. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance or capitalize our activities on terms which are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry or the economy in general, including but not limited to: a downturn in economic conditions in the geographic markets in which we operate or in the financial or credit markets in general; increases in interest rates; the liquidity needs of our depositors as well as competition for deposits; the availability of sufficient collateral that is acceptable to the FHLB and the Federal Reserve Bank, fiscal and monetary policy; and regulatory changes. In addition, our ability to otherwise borrow money or issue and sell debt will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, our credit ratings, and our credit capacity.
Alternative funding to deposits may carry higher costs. If we are required to rely more heavily on more expensive and potentially less stable funding sources or if additional financing sources are unavailable or are not available on acceptable terms, our profitability, liquidity, and prospects could be adversely affected.

We may not be able to develop and maintain a strong core deposit base or other low-cost funding sources.
Our deposits (including checking, savings, money market and other deposits) are the primary funding source for our lending activities. Our future growth will largely depend on our ability to expand core deposits, which provide a less costly and stable funding source. The deposit markets are competitive; therefore, growing our core deposit base could be difficult. In a competitive market, depositors have many choices for where to place their deposits. As we continue to grow our core deposit base and seek to reduce our exposure to high rate/high volatility accounts, we may experience a net deposit outflow, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
We may elect or be compelled to seek additional capital in the future, but that capital may not be available when it is needed or on acceptable terms.
We and the Bank are required by federal regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations. While we believe that our existing capital (which currently exceeds the capital requirements) will be sufficient to support our current operations and expected growth. However, factors such as faster-than-anticipated growth, reduced earnings levels, operating losses, changes in economic conditions, revisions in regulatory requirements, or acquisition opportunities may lead us to seek additional capital. Our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on our financial performance and the conditions in the capital markets, economic conditions, and other factors, many of which are outside our control. Accordingly, we may be unable to raise additional capital if needed or on acceptable terms. If we cannot raise additional capital when needed, our ability to further expand our operations, business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be adversely affected, and the price of our securities may decline.
Our ability to receive dividends from our subsidiaries could affect our liquidity and our ability to pay dividends.
We are a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank and our other subsidiaries. The Federal Reserve Act, Section 23A, limits our ability to borrow from the Bank and our principal source of cash, other than securities offerings, is dividends from the Bank. These dividends are the principal source of funds to pay dividends on our common stock, as well as interest on our junior subordinated debentures and interest and principal on our Senior Notes and our Subordinated Notes. Several laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that the Bank may pay us as well as the dividends that we may pay on our common stock,
 see 
“Supervision and Regulation - Payment of Dividends.” Limitations on our ability to receive dividends from our subsidiaries could adversely affect our liquidity and on our ability to service our debt and pay dividends. 
We cannot assure that we will continue to pay dividends on our common stock in the future. Future dividends will be declared and paid at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on a number of factors including, our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, capital adequacy, cash requirements, prospects, regulatory capital and limitations, among others. Our inability to service our debt, pay our other obligations or pay dividends to our shareholders could adversely impact our financial condition and the value our securities.

Risks related to Credit and Interest Rate
Our profitability is subject to interest rate risk. 
Our profitability depends largely upon net interest income, which is the difference between interest earned on assets, such as loans and investments, and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Interest rate changes may impact our profits and the values of several of our assets and liabilities. We expect to periodically experience “gaps” in the interest rate sensitivities of the Company’s assets and liabilities, meaning that either our interest-bearing liabilities will be more sensitive to changes in market interest rates than our interest-earning assets, or vice versa.
If interest rates rise, our net interest income and the value of our assets could be reduced if interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings, increases more quickly than interest received on interest-earning assets, such as loans and investment securities. In addition, rising interest rates may reduce the demand for loans and the volume of mortgage originations and re-financings, adversely affecting the profitability of our business. Increases in market interest rates may also impact our customers’ ability to repay their loans, which could increase the potential for default and our level of nonperforming assets and adversely affect our operating results. Further, when loans are placed on nonaccrual status any accrued but unpaid interest receivable is reversed, which decreases interest income; simultaneously, we will continue to have a cost to fund the loan, which is reflected as interest expense, without any interest income to offset the associated funding expense. Thus, an increase in the amount of nonperforming assets would have an adverse impact on net interest income. Also, in a rising interest rate environment, fixed-rate loans may adversely affect our margin and present asset/liability mismatches and risks since our liabilities are generally floating rate or have shorter maturities. 
In declining rate environments, we may experience numerous loan prepayments and replacement loans may be priced at a lower rate, decreasing our net interest income. Further, should market interest rates fall below current levels, our net interest income could also be negatively affected if competitive pressures keep us from further reducing rates on our deposits, while the yields on our assets decrease through loan prepayments and interest rate adjustments. Since our balance sheet is asset sensitive, a decrease in interest rates or a flattening or inversion of the yield curve could adversely affect us. 
Market interest rate changes are unpredictable and caused by many factors beyond our control, including general economic conditions (inflation, recession, and unemployment), fiscal and monetary policy, and changes in the United States and other financial markets. In a rapidly changing interest rate environment, we may be unable to manage our interest rate risk effectively, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
Our allowance for credit losses may prove inadequate.
The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and judgment and requires us to make various assumptions and estimates about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers, the value of the collateral securing our loans, our delinquency experience, economic conditions and trends, reasonable and supportable forecasts, and credit quality indicators (including past charge-off experience and levels of past due loans and nonperforming assets).We cannot assure that these assumptions and estimates will be adequate over time to cover expected credit losses in our portfolio. These assumptions and estimates may be affected by changes in the economy, market conditions, or events negatively impacting specific customers, industries or markets, or borrowers repaying their loans. If our allowance for credit losses on loans is not adequate, our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows could be adversely affected. In addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review our allowance for credit losses and may require an increase in the provision for credit losses or the recognition of further charge-offs. Any increases in the provision for credit losses will result in a decrease in net income and may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

On December 31, 2022, we ceased to be an Emerging Growth Company, and we implemented FASB’s Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses, a new guidance on accounting for current expected credit losses on financial instruments (“CECL”). This guidance substantially changed the accounting for credit losses on loans and other financial assets held by banks, financial institutions, and other organizations. The standard changed the previous incurred loss impairment methodology in GAAP. Under the incurred loss model, we recognized losses when they were incurred. On the other hand, CECL requires loans held for investment and debt securities held to maturity to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected (net of the allowance for credit losses). CECL generally results in earlier recognition of expected credit losses and may result in higher provision for credit losses and higher volatility in the quarterly provision for credit losses. Future provisions under the CECL model could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
Our concentration of CRE loans could result in increased loan losses.
CRE is cyclical and poses risks of possible loss due to concentration levels and risks of the assets being financed. Disruptions in markets, economic conditions, including those resulting from a pandemic, changes in laws or regulations or other events could have a significant impact on the ability of our customers to repay and may  adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
Our CRE loans included approximately $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion of fixed rate loans at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. In a rising interest rate environment, fixed rate loans may adversely affect our margin and present asset/liability mismatches and risks since our liabilities are generally floating rate or have shorter maturities. 
As of December 31, 2024, the Bank’s portfolio of CRE loans was 239.4% of its risk-based capital, or 34.5% of its total loans, as of December 31, 2024 compared to 274.3% of its risk-based capital, or 38.4% of its total loans, as of December 31, 2023. We cannot assure that our CRE concentration risk management program will effectively manage our CRE concentration.
CRE loans as well as other loans in our portfolio are secured by real estate. We may experience a significant level of nonperforming real estate loans if the economic conditions of the markets where we operate deteriorate, or in areas where real estate market conditions become distressed. The value of the collateral securing those loans and the revenue stream from those loans could be negatively impacted, and additional provisions for the allowance for credit losses could be required. Our ability to dispose of Other Real Estate Owned (“OREO”) properties at prices at or above the respective carrying values could also be impaired, causing additional losses.
In addition, if the United States economy returns to a recessionary state, management believes that it could significantly affect the economic conditions of the market areas we serve and we could experience significantly higher delinquencies and loan losses, and therefore impact our earnings and financial condition, including our capital and liquidity.

Many of our loans are to commercial borrowers, which have unique risks compared to other types of loans.
As of December 31, 2024, approximately $2.5 billion, or 35%, and $1.8 billion, or 26%, of our loan portfolio was comprised of CRE loans and commercial loans, respectively. Since payments on these loans are often dependent on the successful operation or development of the property or business involved, their repayment is sensitive to adverse conditions in the real estate market and the general economy and the collateral securing these loans may not be sufficient to repay the loan in the event of default. Consequently, downturns in the real estate market and economy increase the risk related to commercial loans, including CRE loans. Unlike residential mortgage loans, which generally are made on the basis of the borrowers’ ability to make repayment from their employment and other income and which are secured by real property whose value tends to be more easily ascertainable, commercial loans typically are made on the basis of the borrowers’ ability to make repayment from the cash flow of the commercial venture. Our commercial loans are primarily made based on the identified cash flow of the borrower and secondarily on the collateral underlying the loans. Most often, this collateral consists of accounts receivable, inventory and equipment. Inventory and equipment may depreciate over time, may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value based on the success of the business. In some cases, the repossession of collateral may not be possible or may be delayed which could negatively impact the value we may realize from that collateral to repay the loan. If the cash flow from business operations is reduced, the borrower’s ability to repay the loan may be impaired. We attempt to mitigate this risk through our underwriting standards, including evaluating the creditworthiness of the borrower, and regular monitoring. However, these procedures cannot entirely eliminate the risk of loss associated with commercial lending. Due to the larger average size of each commercial loan as compared with other loans such as residential loans, as well as collateral that is generally less readily-marketable, losses incurred on a small number of commercial loans could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
In addition, many of these loans are made to small business or middle market customers. In general, these businesses have less capital or borrowing capacity than larger businesses, may be more vulnerable to declines in economic conditions, often need substantial additional capital to expand or compete, and may experience significant volatility in operating results, any of which, individually or in the aggregate, may impair their ability to repay their loans, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
If a decline in economic conditions, natural disasters affecting business development or other issues cause difficulties for our borrowers of these types of loans, if we fail to assess the credit of these loans accurately when underwriting them or if we fail to adequately continue to monitor the performance of these loans, our loan portfolio could experience delinquencies, defaults and credit losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
Our valuation of securities and the determination of a credit loss allowance in our investment securities portfolio are subjective and, if changed, could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.
Fixed-maturity securities, as well as short-term investments which are reported at estimated fair value, represent the majority of our total investments. We generally define fair value as the price that would be received in the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability. Considerable judgment is often required in interpreting market data to develop estimates of fair value, and the use of different assumptions or valuation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts. During periods of market disruption (including periods of significantly rising or high interest rates, or rapidly widening credit spreads) certain asset classes may become illiquid and it may be difficult to value certain of our securities if trading becomes less frequent or market data becomes less observable. In those cases, the valuation process includes inputs that are less observable and require more subjectivity and management judgment. Valuations may result in estimated fair values which vary significantly from the amount at which the investments may ultimately be sold. Further, rapidly changing and unprecedented credit and equity market conditions could materially affect the valuation of securities in our financial statements and the period-to-period changes in estimated fair value could vary significantly.

As of December 31, 2024, the fair value of the Company’s debt securities available for sale was approximately $1.4 billion, compared to $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2024 debt securities available-for-sale had net unrealized holding losses of $55.7 million ($100.3 million in 2023) and net unrealized holding gains of $0.9 million ($3.2 million in 2023). In 2024, the Company recorded pre-tax net unrealized holding losses of $42.2 million ($14.9 million in 2023) which are included in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income for the period. These unrealized losses were mainly attributable to increases in market interest rates during the periods which translated into a decline in the estimated fair value of debt securities and other instruments. 
Beginning January 1, 2022, debt securities available for sale are analyzed for credit losses under the new guidance on accounting for CECL, which requires the Company to determine whether the securities are considered impaired because their fair value is below their amortized cost basis as of the reporting date, and whether there is a need of a credit loss allowance. An allowance for credit losses is established for losses on debt securities available for sale due to credit losses and is reported as a component of provision for credit losses. Accrued interest is excluded from our expected credit loss estimates. In 2024, the Company did not record an allowance for estimated credit losses on any of its debt securities available for sale. For more information about CECL, 
see
 Note 1 of our audited consolidated financial statements in this Form-10-K. Prior to January 1, 2022, our debt securities classified as available for sale or held to maturity were generally evaluated for other than temporary impairment under the applicable accounting guidance.
The valuation of our investment portfolio is also influenced by external market and other factors, including implementation of SEC and FASB guidance on fair value accounting. Accordingly, if market conditions deteriorate further and/or accounting guidance is updated and we determine our holdings of investment securities have experienced credit losses, our future earnings, financial condition, regulatory capital and continuing operations could be materially adversely affected.
Nonperforming and similar assets take significant time to resolve and may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
At December 31, 2024 and 2023, our nonperforming loans totaled $104.1 million and $34.4 million, respectively, or 1.43% and 0.47% of total loans, respectively. We had OREO balances of $18.1 million and $20.2 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our non-performing assets may adversely affect our net income in various ways. We do not record interest income on nonaccrual loans or OREO, and these assets require higher loan administration and other costs, thereby adversely affecting our income. Decreases in the value of these assets, or the underlying collateral, or in the related borrowers’ performance or financial condition, whether or not due to economic and market conditions beyond our control, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.  Any increase in our nonperforming assets and related increases in our provision for credit losses could negatively affect our business and could have a material adverse effect on our capital, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the resolution of nonperforming assets requires commitments of time from management, which can be detrimental to their other responsibilities. We cannot assure you we will not experience increases in nonperforming loans, OREO and similar nonperforming assets in the future.

We are subject to environmental liability risk associated with lending activities
.
A significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real property. During our ordinary course of business, we may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans. There is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties. If hazardous or toxic substances are found, we may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage. Environmental laws may require the Company to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected property’s value or limit our ability to use or sell the affected property. In addition, future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws and regulations may increase our exposure to environmental liability. Environmental reviews of real property before initiating foreclosure may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
Weakness in the demand for mortgage loans or in the secondary market for residential mortgage loans  can adversely affect us. 
Interest rates, housing inventory, housing demand, and other market conditions have a direct effect on mortgage loan originations. Since 2022, as market interest rates increased, the demand for residential mortgage loans has declined, negatively impacting revenue from our mortgage business, primarily due to lower mortgage volumes. Noninterest income from our mortgage operations may continue to suffer as a result of decreased loan origination activity caused by an economic downturn, fewer refinancing transactions, higher interest rates, or housing price pressure. Also, our results of operations are affected by the amount of noninterest expenses (including personnel and systems infrastructure expenses) associated with our mortgage business activities. During periods of reduced loan demand, our results of operations may be adversely affected should we be unable to reduce expenses proportionate with the decline in mortgage loan origination activity.
In addition, a decrease in residential real estate market prices or lower levels of home sales, could result in lower single family home values, adversely affecting the value of collateral securing residential mortgage loans and residential property collateral securing loans that we hold, mortgage loan originations and gains on the sale of mortgage loans. A decline in real estate prices increases delinquencies and losses on certain mortgage loans, generally, and particularly on second lien mortgages and home equity lines of credit. A substantial portion of our single family loans consist of jumbo loans, and the secondary market for jumbo mortgages has historically been less liquid compared to conforming loans
. 
Significant ongoing disruptions in the secondary market for residential mortgage loans can limit the market for and liquidity of most residential mortgage loans other than conforming Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac loans. Deteriorating trends could occur, including declines in real estate values, home sales volumes, financial stress on borrowers as a result of job losses, increase in interest rates or other factors. These could adversely impact borrowers and result in higher delinquencies and greater charge-offs in future periods, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. In the event our allowance for credit losses on these loans is insufficient to cover such losses, our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows could be adversely affected.
Risks Related to Our Business and Operations
Many of our major systems depend on and are operated by third-party vendors, and any systems failures or interruptions could adversely affect our operations and the services we provide to our customers.
We outsource many of our major systems and critical back-office operations, such as data processing, recording, and monitoring transactions, online banking interfaces and service, internet connections and network access. For example, we entered into a new multi-year outsourcing agreement with the world's largest provider of banking and payments technology, to assume full responsibility over a significant number of the Bank’s support functions and staff, including certain critical back-office operations. In November 2023 we transitioned our entire

core banking system to the one this vendor offers and services. An interruption or failure of the services we receive through these outsourced systems could cause an interruption of our operations. The occurrence of any systems failure or interruption could damage our reputation and result in a loss of customers and business, could subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or could expose us to legal liability. Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
Our information systems are exposed to cybersecurity threats and may experience interruptions and security breaches that could adversely affect our business and reputation.
We rely heavily on communications and information systems, including those provided by third-party service providers, to conduct our business.  Any failure, interruption, or security breach of these systems could result in failures or disruptions which could impact our ability to serve our customers, operate our business and affect our customers’ privacy and could damage our reputation, result in a loss of business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny or enforcement or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability. Our systems and networks, as well as those of our third-party service providers, are subject to security risks and could be susceptible to cyberattacks by third parties, including through coordinated attacks sponsored by foreign nations and criminal organizations to disrupt business operations and other compromises to data and systems for political or criminal purposes. Cyber threats are rapidly evolving and we may not be able to anticipate or prevent all such attacks and could be held liable for any security breach or loss. These risks have increased with the implementation of remote and/or hybrid work protocols and may continue to increase in the future as the use of mobile banking and other internet-based products and services continues to grow.
For example, in August 2022 and November 2023, we were notified by different third-party vendors that they had experienced potential cybersecurity incidents. On both occasions, we activated our incident response plan and the vendors completed forensic analyses to determine whether information from the Bank's customers was accessed and exfiltrated in an unauthorized manner. Once the forensic analyses were completed, we worked with the vendors and outside advisors to determine the appropriate course of action, including having the vendors provide notice to our affected customers and offer free credit monitoring services when appropriate. Our business, financial condition, or results of operations were not materially adversely affected by these cybersecurity incidents. We are not aware of any continuing cybersecurity threats or breaches involving these vendors, however, we, as well as our customers, regulators, and service providers, have experienced and will likely continue to experience a significant increase in information security and cybersecurity threats and attacks, see Item 1C. Cybersecurity for an additional discussion on our information security program. 
Despite our cybersecurity policies and procedures and our efforts to monitor and ensure the integrity of our and our service providers’ systems, we may not be able to anticipate all types of security threats, nor may we be able to implement preventive measures effective against all such security threats. In addition, the impact and severity of a particular cyberattack may not be immediately clear, and it may take a significant amount of time before such determination can be made. While the investigation of a cyberattack is ongoing, we may not be fully aware of the extent of the harm caused by the cyberattack and it may not be clear how to contain and remediate such harm and any damage may continue to spread. 
Security breaches or failures may have serious adverse financial and other consequences, including significant legal and remediation costs, disruption of operations, misappropriation of confidential information, damage to systems operated by us or our third-party service providers, as well as damaging our customers and our counterparties. Such losses and claims may not be covered by our insurance. In addition to the immediate costs of any failure, interruption or security breach, including those at our third-party service providers, these events could damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could adversely affect on business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
Our strategic plan and growth strategy may not be achieved as quickly or as fully as we seek.
The implementation of our strategic plan and growth strategy may take longer than we anticipate to implement, and the results we achieve may not be as successful as we seek, all of which could adversely affect our business, financial conditions, results of operations, or cash flows. Additionally, the results of our strategic plan and growth strategy are subject to the other risks described herein that affect our business, which include: lending, interest rate

risk, seeking deposits and wealth management clients in highly competitive domestic markets; our ability to achieve our growth plans or to manage our growth effectively; the benefits from our technology investments may not be realized or may take longer than expected to be realized and may not be as large as expected, or may require additional investments; and if we are unable to achieve economies of scale or reduce our cost structure, we may not be able to meet our profitability objectives.
Defaults by or deteriorating asset quality of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.
Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. We routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk and losses in the event of a default by a counterparty. Any such losses could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. We also may have exposure to these financial institutions in the form of unsecured debt instruments, derivatives and other securities. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry in general, have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions in the future. Further, potential action by governments and regulatory bodies in response to financial crises affecting the global and U.S. banking systems and financial markets, such as nationalization, conservatorship, receivership and other intervention, or lack of action by governments and central banks, as well as deterioration in a financial institution’s creditworthiness, could  adversely affect the value and/or liquidity of these instruments, securities, transactions and investments or limit our ability to trade with them. Any losses or impairments to the carrying value of these investments or other changes may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
New lines of business, new products and services, or strategic project initiatives may subject us to additional risks.
We periodically evaluate our service offerings and, occasionally, may seek to implement new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business. There are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts, including external factors, such as compliance with regulations, competitive alternatives, and shifting market preferences, that may impact the successful implementation of a new line of business and/or a new product or service. In developing and marketing new lines of business and/or new products and services, we may invest significant time and resources. Initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business and/or new products or services may not be achieved, and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible, which could in turn have a material negative effect on our operating results. Additionally, any new line of business and/or new product or service could require the establishment of new key and other controls and have a significant impact on our existing system of internal controls. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business and/or new products or services could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
We are susceptible to operational risks in general and fraudulent risk in particular.
We operate many different financial service functions and rely on the ability of our employees, third party vendors and systems to process a significant number of transactions. Operational risk is the risk of loss from operations, including fraud by employees or outside persons, employees’ execution of incorrect or unauthorized transactions, data processing and technology errors or hacking and breaches of internal control systems. We have adopted flexible work arrangements that permit some employees to work from home full or part time, and these work arrangements could strain our technology resources and introduce operational risks, including heightened cybersecurity risk, as remote working environments can be less secure. 
We, as other financial institutions, are inherently exposed to fraud risk. Fraudsters are leveraging new technologies, including artificial intelligence, to impersonate our customers and/or steal personally identifiable information to commit fraud. Fraudulent activity can take many forms and has increased as new products and features that facilitate the access for financial services are implemented, such as real-time payment services. We are susceptible to fraud being perpetrated by customers, employees, vendors, or members of the general public. We are subject to fraud risk in connection with loan origination, payment transactions (including ACH transactions, wire 
49
Table of 
Contents
 
transactions, and digital payments), ATM transactions, checking, withdrawal transactions and other transactions. In connection with loan origination, we significantly rely on information supplied by loan applicants and third parties, including the information contained in the loan application, appraisals of property, title information as well as employment and income documentation provided by third parties. If any of this information is misrepresented and we do not detect such misrepresentation prior to funding, we generally bear the risk of loss related to the misrepresentation. Although we are constantly investing in systems, resources, and controls aimed at mitigating fraud risk, there can be no assurance that our efforts will be effective in detecting and preventing fraud or that we will not incur fraud losses or  costs or other damage related to such fraud, at levels that adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, or reputation.
We may not have the ability or resources to keep pace with rapid technological changes in the financial services industry or implement new technology effectively.
The financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. In addition to allowing us to service our clients better, the effective use of technology may increase efficiency and may enable financial institutions to reduce costs and the risks associated with fraud and other operational risks. Our future success will partially depend upon our ability to use technology effectively. We may be unable to effectively implement new technology-driven enhancements of products and services as quickly or at the costs anticipated, which could impair our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from such new technology or require us to incur significant costs to remedy any such challenges in a timely manner. 
Many larger competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements and, increasingly, non-banking firms are using technology to compete with traditional lenders for loans and other banking services. Third parties and vendors upon which we rely for our technology needs may not be able to develop, on a cost-effective basis, systems that will enable us to keep pace with such developments. As a result, our larger competitors may be able to offer additional or superior products compared to those that we will be able to provide, which would put us at a competitive disadvantage. We may lose customers seeking new technology-driven products and services to the extent we are unable to provide such products and services. The ability to keep pace with technological change is important and the failure to do so could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. 
Conditions in Venezuela could adversely affect our operations. 
At December 31, 2024, 24% of our deposits, or approximately $1.9 billion, were from Venezuelan residents. All of the Bank’s deposits are denominated in U.S. Dollars. Adverse economic conditions in Venezuela may continue to negatively affect our Venezuelan deposit base, as customers residing in Venezuela rely on their U.S. Dollar deposits to fund living expenses and other necessities without being able to generate additional U.S. Dollars. 
In addition, although we seek to increase our trust, brokerage and investment advisory business from our domestic markets, substantially all our revenue from these services currently is from Venezuelan customers.  Economic and other conditions in Venezuela, or U.S. regulations or sanctions affecting the services we may provide to our Venezuelan customers may adversely affect the amounts of assets we manage or custody, and the trading volumes of our Venezuelan customers, reducing fees and commissions we earn from these businesses, and may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. 
We are subject to environmental, social and governance, or ESG, risks, many of which are outside of our control, that could harm our reputation, our business, operations, financial condition, and/or the price of our common stock.
Companies across all industries are facing scrutiny from stakeholders (among them shareholders, customers, employees, federal and state regulatory authorities, and policy makers) related to ESG matters. These stakeholders may often have differing, and sometimes conflicting, priorities and expectations regarding ESG issues. Recently, there have been an increase in the number of state-level anti-ESG initiatives in the U.S. that may conflict with regulatory requirements or our various stakeholders’ expectations. Also, diversity, equity and inclusion (“DEI”) practices being implemented by corporations have recently come under increased scrutiny and recent actions taken by federal executive branch agencies and federal and state attorneys general may signal an increased focus on 
50
Table of 
Contents
 
investigating private entities with respect to DEI programs and policies, including publicly traded companies. These conflicting and divergent attitudes towards ESG-related matters increase the risk that any action or lack thereof by us on such matters will be perceived negatively by some stakeholders. If we are unable to meet expectations and standards from stakeholders, including policy makers, regarding ESG related issues,  or if we are perceived to have not responded appropriately, or take action in conflict with one or another of those stakeholder’s expectations, our reputation could be negatively impacted and could lead to loss of business, adverse publicity, or customer complaints.
 
Any negative impact on our reputation in connection with ESG matters, changes in investing priorities among investors, or any loss of business resulting from these issues, may adversely affect our business, financial condition, operations, and/or effects the trading price of our common stock.

We may be unable to attract and retain key people to support our business.
Our success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract and retain experienced personnel in key positions. Intense competition exists in the activities and markets that we serve for candidates with appropriate qualifications and demonstrated ability. If we are unable to hire and retain key individuals, we may be unable to implement our business strategy and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be negatively impacted. Our ability to attract and retain employees could also be impacted by changing workforce expectations, practices, and preferences, including remote work and hybrid work preferences, and increasing labor shortages and competition for labor, which could increase labor costs. Failure to attract well-qualified employees or to develop and retain our employees may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
Severe weather, natural disasters, global pandemics, acts of war or terrorism, theft, civil unrest, government expropriation or other external events could have significant effects on our business.
Severe weather and natural disasters, (including hurricanes, tornados, earthquakes, fires, droughts and floods), acts of war or terrorism (such as hostilities in Ukraine and the Middle-East region), epidemics and global pandemics (such as the COVID-19 outbreak), theft, civil unrest, government expropriation, condemnation or other external events in the markets where we operate or where our customers live (including Venezuela) could have a significant effect on our ability to conduct business. Such events could affect the stability of our deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause significant property damage, impair employee productivity, result in loss of revenue and/or cause us to incur additional expenses. The occurrence of any such event could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
Our business is mainly concentrated in South Florida and the greater Tampa, Florida area, which may increase our risks from extreme weather. These market areas are susceptible to hurricanes, tropical storms and other similar severe weather events which could have the effects indicated above. Additionally, the potential for such weather events has and may continue to cause our customers to incur higher property and casualty insurance premiums which may adversely affect the value and sales of real estate in the markets we operate. Additionally, the impact of severe weather in the markets where we operate has and may continue to increase the cost and reduce the availability of insurance needed for our business operations. 
Any failure to protect the confidentiality of customer information could adversely affect our reputation and subject us to financial sanctions and other costs that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
Various federal, state and foreign laws enforced by the bank regulators and other agencies protect the privacy and security of customers’ non-public personal information. Many of our employees have access to, and routinely process, sensitive personal customer information, including through their access to information technology systems. An employee could, intentionally or unintentionally, disclose or misappropriate confidential client information or our data could be the subject of a cybersecurity attack (including intrusion by hackers, and phishing attacks). If we or any of our third party vendors are subject to a successful cyberattack or fail to maintain adequate internal controls, or if our employees fail to comply with our policies and procedures, misappropriation or intentional or unintentional inappropriate disclosure or misuse of client information could occur. Such cyberattacks, if they result from internal control inadequacies or non-compliance, could materially damage our reputation, lead to civil or criminal penalties, or both, which, in turn, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

We could be required to write down our goodwill and other intangible assets
.
We had goodwill of $19.2 million and other intangible assets of $5.8 million at December 31, 2024. Our business acquisitions typically have resulted in goodwill and other intangible assets and these may result in a future impairment expense. We make estimates and assumptions in valuing such goodwill and intangible assets that affect our consolidated financial statements. In accordance with GAAP, our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired. The estimated fair value is affected by the performance of the business, which may be especially diminished by prolonged market declines. If the goodwill has been impaired, we must write down the goodwill by the amount of the impairment, with a corresponding charge to net income. Based on the annual impairment analysis, the Company determined that goodwill was not impaired as of December 31, 2024. In 2024, the Company recorded a $0.3 million pre-tax write off in other intangibles assets in connection with the Houston Sale Transaction If we record any future impairment loss related to our goodwill or other intangible assets, it could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the results of impairment testing on our goodwill or other intangible assets have no impact on our tangible book value or regulatory capital levels.
We have a net deferred tax asset that may or may not be fully realized.
Deferred income tax represents the tax effect of the timing differences between financial accounting and tax reporting. Deferred tax assets, or DTAs, are assessed periodically by management to determine whether they are realizable. Factors in management’s determination include the performance of the business, including the ability to generate future taxable income. Realizing a deferred tax asset requires us to apply significant judgment and such judgment is inherently speculative because it requires estimates that cannot be made with certainty. If, based on available information, it is more likely than not that the deferred income tax asset will not be realized, then a valuation allowance must be established with a corresponding charge to net income. Such charges could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. In addition, changes in the corporate tax rates could affect the value of our DTAs and may require a write-off of a portion of some of those assets. At December 31, 2024, we had net DTAs with a book value of $53.5 million, based on a U.S. corporate income tax rate of 21%. 
See
 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.”
We may incur losses due to minority investments in fintech and specialty finance companies. 
From time to time, we may make or consider making minority investments in fintech and specialty finance companies. If we do so, we may not be able to influence the activities of companies in which we invest and may suffer losses due to these activities. For example, the companies we invest in may have economic or business interests, values, or goals that are inconsistent or conflict with ours, which could damage our reputation or business. Additionally, the companies we invest in may experience financial difficulties, default on their obligations, diminished liquidity or insolvency; or our management team’s distraction relative to the potential financial benefit may be disproportional. In addition, although we may seek board representation in connection with certain investments, we cannot assure you that such representation will be obtained or that such representation will result in Amerant having a meaningful say in the Board decisions of such company. If the companies we invest in seek additional financing in the future to fund their growth strategies, these financing transactions may result in dilution to our ownership stakes and these transactions may occur at lower valuations than the investment transaction through which we acquired such ownership interest, which could significantly decrease the fair value of our investment in those entities. We may also be unable to dispose of our minority investments within our contemplated time horizon or at all. Our inability to dispose of our minority investment in an entity or a downward adjustment to or impairment of an equity investment could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

We are subject to risks associated with sub-leasing portions of our corporate headquarters building
.
In December 2021, we sold our approximately 177,000 square foot headquarters building (the “Property”) and entered into an 18-year triple net lease for the Property (the “Lease”) at an initial base rent of $7,500,000 per year (escalating 1.5% each year), under which we are also responsible for the Property’s insurance, real estate taxes, and maintenance and repair expenses. During the term of the Lease, we have the right to sublet the whole or any part of the Property.
While we occupy and we expect to continue to occupy a portion of the Property, we also currently sublease and intend to continue to sublease a significant portion of the Property to third parties. When we sublease spaces in the Property to third parties, we are not released from our underlying obligations under the Lease. We rely on the sublease income from subtenants to offset the expenses incurred related to our obligations under the Lease. Although we assess the financial condition of each subtenant to which we sublease space in the Property, the financial condition of each such subtenant or of a sublease guarantor(s), if any, may deteriorate over time. If a subtenant of the Property does not perform under the terms of a sublease agreement (due to its financial condition or other factors), we may not be able to recover amounts owed to us under the terms of each sublease agreement or the related guarantees, if any. If subtenants default or terminate their subleases with us, we may experience a loss of planned sublease rental income, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Additionally, if subtenants default on their sublease obligations with us or otherwise terminate their sublease agreement with us, we may be unable to secure a new subtenant on a timely basis, or at all, on the same or more favorable rent terms.
Our success depends on our ability to compete effectively in highly competitive markets.
The Florida banking markets in which we do business are highly competitive; therefore, our future growth and success will depend on our ability to compete effectively in these markets. We compete for deposits, loans, and other financial services in our markets with other local, regional and national commercial banks, thrifts, credit unions, mortgage lenders, trust services providers and securities advisory and brokerage firms. Marketplace lenders operating nationwide over the internet are also growing rapidly, other fintech developments, including blockchain and other technologies, may potentially disrupt the financial services industry and impact the way banks do business. Many of our competitors offer products and services different from us, and have substantially greater resources, name recognition and market presence than we do, which benefits them in attracting business. In addition, larger competitors may be able to price loans and deposits more aggressively than we are able to and have broader and more diverse customer and geographic bases to draw upon.

Risks Related to Risk Management, Internal Audit, Internal and Disclosure Controls
Potential gaps in our risk management policies and internal audit procedures may leave us exposed to unidentified or unanticipated risk, which could negatively affect our business.
Our enterprise risk management and internal audit programs are designed to mitigate material risks. There may be inherent limitations to our current and future risk management strategies, including risks that we have not appropriately anticipated or identified. Additionally, our internal audit process may fail to detect such weaknesses or deficiencies in our risk management framework. Many of our methods for managing risk and exposures are based on observed historical market behavior to model or project potential future exposure. Models used by our business are based on assumptions and projections. These models may not operate properly, or our inputs and assumptions may be inaccurate or not be adopted quickly enough to reflect changes in behavior, markets, or technology. As a result, these methods may not fully predict future exposures, which can be significantly different and greater than historical measures indicate. In addition, our business and the markets in which we operate are continuously evolving, and we may fail to fully understand the implications of changes in our business or the financial markets or fail to adequately or timely enhance our enterprise risk framework to address those changes. Furthermore, we cannot assure that we can effectively review and monitor all risks or that all of our employees will closely follow our risk management policies and procedures, or that our risk management policies and procedures will enable us to accurately identify all risks and limit timely our exposures based on our assessments. If our enterprise risk management framework proves ineffective, we could suffer unexpected losses, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
Any failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could impair the reliability of our financial statements, which in turn could harm our business, impair investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and our access to the capital markets and cause the price of our common stock to decline and subject us to regulatory penalties.
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, or ICFR and for evaluating and reporting on that system of internal control. Our ICFR is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires us to furnish annually a report by management on the effectiveness of our ICFR. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm is required to report on the effectiveness of our ICFR.
If we fail to implement and maintain effective ICFR, our ability to accurately and timely report our financial results could be impaired, which could result in late filings of our periodic reports under the Exchange Act, restatements of our consolidated financial statements, and suspension or delisting of our common stock from the New York Stock Exchange. Such events could harm our business, cause investors to lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our reported financial information, cause the trading price of our shares of common stock to decline, our access to the capital markets or other financing sources could be limited and subject us to investigations, enforcement actions or regulatory penalties. 
Changes in accounting standards could materially impact our financial statements
From time to time, accounting standards setters change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. These changes can be difficult to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in changes to previously reported financial results or a cumulative charge to retained earnings. See Note 1 - Business, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Item 15.1 Consolidated Financial Statements in this report for further information regarding accounting standards updates.

Risks Related to External and Market Factors
Material and negative developments adversely impacting the financial services industry at large and causing volatility in financial markets and the economy may have materially adverse effects on our liquidity, business, financial condition and results of operations
.
The actual occurrence or widespread concerns regarding the potential occurrence of illiquidity, operational failures, defaults, non-performance or other material and adverse developments that impact financial institutions and transactional counterparties, or other entities within the financial services industry at large, have previously caused, and could continue to cause, market-wide liquidity issues, bank-runs and general contagion across the global and U.S. financial services industry. For example, in March and April 2023, significant deposit withdrawals or bank runs precipitated the failure of four banks in the U.S. causing a state of volatility in the capital and credit markets and uncertainty regarding the health of the U.S. banking system, particularly around liquidity, uninsured deposits and customer concentrations. This volatility particularly impacted the price of securities issued by financial institutions, including ours. While during this crisis and historically, the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC have ensured that depositors of failed banks had access to their deposits, including uninsured deposit accounts, there is no guarantee that such actions will continue to be successful in restoring customer confidence in regional banks and the banking system more broadly. Similarly, there can be no assurance that there will not be additional bank failures or issues in the broader financial system or that these U.S. government entities will act in a similar fashion in the event of the future closure or failure of any other banks or financial institutions. In addition, the cost of resolving bank failures may prompt the FDIC to charge higher premiums above the current levels or to issue additional special assessments. Additionally, although the industry has stabilized since these failures and the customer confidence in the safety and soundness of smaller regional and community banks has improved, the risk remains that customers may choose to maintain deposits with large financial institutions or invest in higher yielding short-term fixed income securities, all of which could materially adversely impact the Company's liquidity, loan funding capacity, net interest margin, capital and results of operations.
Adverse financial market and economic conditions may continue to exert downward pressure on the prices of stock and other securities and negatively impact credit availability for certain issuers, including us, without regard to their underlying financial strength.  Any future events that cause financial market and economic disruption, volatility and decreased levels of customer confidence may cause us to experience adverse effects, which may materially impact our liquidity, business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
Our business may be adversely affected by economic conditions in general and by conditions in the financial markets. 
We are exposed to downturns in the U.S. economy and market conditions generally. We cannot accurately predict the possibility of the national or local economy’s return to a period of economic weakness or to recessionary conditions. Our primary markets are concentrated the in Miami-Dade, Broward, Palm Beach and Hillsborough (Tampa) counties in Florida. Adverse economic conditions in any of these areas and in the national economy may impact us significantly and unpredictably. Markets in the U.S. may be affected by the level and volatility of interest rates, availability and market conditions of financing, unexpected changes in gross domestic product, economic growth or its sustainability, inflation, supply chain disruptions, consumer spending, employment levels, labor shortages, wage stagnation, federal government shutdowns, developments related to the U.S. federal debt ceiling, energy prices, home prices, commercial property values, fluctuations or other significant changes in both debt and equity capital markets and currencies, liquidity of the global financial markets, the growth of global trade and commerce, trade policies, tariffs, a U.S. withdrawal from or significant renegotiation of trade agreements, trade wars, the availability and cost of capital and credit, disruption of communication, transportation or energy infrastructure and investor sentiment and confidence. 
We may face the following particular risks: the demand for loans and our other products and services could decline, market developments may negatively affect industries we extend credit to and may result in increased delinquencies and default rates, which, among other effects, could negatively impact our charge-offs and allowance for credit losses; market disruptions could make valuation of assets more difficult and subjective and may negatively 
56

affect our ability to measure the fair value of our assets; and, loan performance could deteriorate, loan default levels and foreclosure activity increase and or our assets could materially decline in value. Any of these risks individually or a combination could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. 
Risks Related to Regulatory and Legal Matters
We are subject to extensive regulation that could limit or restrict our activities and adversely affect our earnings.
Several regulators, including the Federal Reserve, the OCC, the FDIC, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, and the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority, regulate us and our subsidiaries
. 
 Our success is impacted by regulations affecting banks and bank holding companies, and the securities markets, and our costs of compliance could adversely affect our earnings. Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors, consumers and the FDIC’s DIF, not shareholders. The financial services industry also is subject to frequent legislative and regulatory changes. The nature, effects and timing of legislative and regulatory changes, cannot be predicted. Changes, if adopted, could require us to maintain more capital, liquidity, or adopt changes to our operating policies and procedures and risk controls which could adversely affect our growth, profitability and financial condition. Compliance with applicable laws and regulations is time consuming and costly and may affect our profitability.
Additionally, banks with greater than $10 billion in total consolidated assets are subject to additional regulatory requirements. As of December 31, 2024, our total assets were $9.9 billion. Based on our current total assets and growth strategy, we anticipate our total assets may exceed $10 billion in 2025. In addition to our current regulatory requirements, banks with $10 billion or more in total assets are, among other things: examined directly by the CFPB with respect to various federal consumer financial laws; subject to reduced dividends on the Bank’s holdings of Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta common stock; subject to limits on interchange fees pursuant to the “Durbin Amendment” to the Dodd-Frank Act; subject to certain enhanced prudential standards; and no longer treated as a “small institution” for FDIC deposit insurance assessment purposes.
Compliance with these additional ongoing requirements may necessitate additional personnel, the design and implementation of additional internal controls, or may result in other significant expenses, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
There is uncertainty surrounding the potential legal, regulatory and policy changes by the presidential administration in the United States that may directly affect financial institutions.
At this time, it is difficult to predict the legislative and regulatory changes that will result from the combination of President Trump’s reelection and both Houses of Congress having majority memberships from the Republican party. However, we anticipate that the Presidential administration will seek to implement a regulatory reform agenda that is significantly different than that of the Biden administration. In addition, the change in presidential administration has, and is expected to continue to, result in certain changes in the leadership and senior staffs of the federal banking agencies. Such changes are likely to impact the rulemaking, supervision, examination and enforcement priorities and policies of the agencies. In addition, changes in key personnel at the agencies that regulate such banking organizations, including the federal banking agencies, may result in differing interpretations of existing rules and guidelines and potentially different enforcement priorities. While we do not specifically know what these changes will be, we may be required to implement different compliance procedures and modify our policies and activities to comply with changes set forth by the new administration. To achieve compliance with any changes from the Presidential administration, we may have to incur additional costs and expenses, and dedicate additional resources, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
Changes in federal, state or local tax laws, or audits from tax authorities, could negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

We are subject to changes in tax law that could increase our effective tax rates. These law changes may be retroactive to previous periods and as a result could negatively affect our current and future financial performance. In particular, the Inflation Reduction Act, which was signed into law in the United States in August 2022, among other things, imposes a surcharge on stock repurchases. Changes to our tax liability could have a material effect on our results of operations. In addition, our customers are subject to a wide variety of federal, state and local taxes. Changes in taxes paid by our customers may affect their ability to purchase homes or consumer products and could also make some businesses and industries less inclined to borrow, potentially reducing demand for our loans and deposit products. In addition, such negative effects on our customers could result in defaults on the loans we have made which would reduce our profitability and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. 
We are also subject to potential tax audits in various jurisdictions and in such event, tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess penalties or additional taxes. While we assess regularly the likely outcomes of these potential audits, there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcome of a potential audit, and an audit could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

Litigation and regulatory investigations are increasingly common in our businesses and may result in significant financial losses and/or harm to our reputation.
We face risks of litigation and regulatory investigations and actions, including the risk of class action lawsuits.  Plaintiffs in class action and other lawsuits against us may seek very large or indeterminate amounts, including punitive and treble damages.  Due to the vagaries of litigation, the outcome of a litigation matter and the amount or range of potential loss at particular points in time may normally be difficult to ascertain.   
A substantial legal liability or a significant federal, state or regulatory action, inquiry or investigation could harm our reputation, result in material fines, penalties, or legal costs, divert management resources away from our business, and otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.  Even if we ultimately prevail in a litigation, regulatory action or investigation, our ability to attract new customers, retain our current customers and recruit and retain employees could be adversely affected.  Regulatory inquiries and litigation may also adversely affect the prices or volatility of our securities specifically, or the securities of our industry, generally.
We are subject to capital adequacy and liquidity standards, and if we fail to meet these standards, whether due to losses, growth opportunities or an inability to raise additional capital or otherwise, our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows would be adversely affected.
We, as a bank holding company, and the Bank are subject to capital rules of the Federal Reserve and the OCC, that implement a set of capital requirements issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision known as Basel III. 
See 
“Supervision and Regulation—Capital Requirements.” The regulatory capital rules applicable to us and the Bank may continue to change. We cannot predict the effect on us and the Bank of changes to the current capital requirements. 
Our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend, among other, on the capital market conditions and on our financial condition and performance. Any failure to remain “well capitalized” for bank regulatory purposes could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows, In addition, any failure to meet these capital and other regulatory requirements could affect our customers’ confidence, our cost of and availability of funds or FDIC deposit insurance premiums; and our ability to grow, raise, rollover or replace brokered deposits; make acquisitions, open new branches or engage in new activities; make payments of principal and interest on our debt instruments; and  pay dividends on our capital stock.
Increases in FDIC deposit insurance premiums and assessments could adversely affect our financial condition.
 
FDIC insurance premiums we pay may change and be significantly higher in the future. The FDIC may be forced to charge higher premiums in the future if market developments significantly deplete the insurance fund of the FDIC and reduce the ratio of reserves to insured deposits. In addition, the method that the FDIC uses to determine the amount of our deposit insurance premium will change once our total consolidated assets exceed $10 billion, which we expect may happen in 2025. Any increases in our assessment rate, future special assessments, or required prepayments in FDIC insurance premiums could reduce our profitability or limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

Federal banking agencies periodically conduct examinations of our business, including our compliance with laws and regulations, and our failure to comply with any regulatory actions, if any, could adversely impact us. 
The Federal Reserve and the OCC periodically conduct examinations of our business and the Bank’s business, including compliance with laws and regulations. A federal banking agency may take such remedial actions as it deems appropriate, if, as a result of an examination, it were to determine that the financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, asset concentrations, earnings prospects, management, liquidity, asset sensitivity, risk management or other aspects of any of our operations have become unsatisfactory, or that we or our management were in violation of any law or regulation. If we become subject to such regulatory actions, our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows and reputation would likely be adversely affected.
The Federal Reserve may require us to commit capital resources to support the Bank.
As a matter of policy, the Federal Reserve, which examines us, expects a bank holding company to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to a subsidiary bank and to commit resources to support such subsidiary bank.  The Federal Reserve may require a bank holding company to inject capital into a troubled subsidiary bank.  In addition, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Act, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act, requires that all companies that control an FDIC-insured depository institution must serve as a source of financial strength to the depository institution.  Under this requirement, we could be required to provide financial assistance to the Bank should it experience financial distress, even if further investments were not otherwise warranted.  
See
 “Source of Strength in Supervision and Regulation.”
We may face higher risks of noncompliance with the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations than other financial institutions.
The USA Patriot and BSA and the related federal regulations require banks to establish anti-money laundering programs that include, policies, procedures and controls to detect, prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing and to verify the identity of their customers and of beneficial owners of their legal entity customers. In addition, FinCEN, which was established as part of the Treasury Department to combat money laundering, is authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of anti-money laundering rules. 
The Bank is also subject to  regulatory scrutiny of compliance with the rules of the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC which administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions based on U.S. foreign policy and national security goals, including sanctions against foreign countries, regimes and individuals, terrorists, international narcotics traffickers, and those involved in the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Executive Orders have sanctioned the Venezuelan government and entities it owns, and certain Venezuelan persons. In addition, the OCC has broad authority to bring enforcement actions and to impose monetary penalties if it finds deficiencies in the Bank’s compliance with anti-money laundering laws.
Monitoring compliance with anti-money laundering and OFAC rules is complex and expensive. The risk of noncompliance with such rules can be more acute for financial institutions like us that have numerous customers from Latin America or who do business there. As of December 31, 2024, $1.9 billion, or 24.1%, of our total deposits and a significant portion of our assets under management were from residents of Venezuela. Our total loan exposure to international markets, primarily individuals in Venezuela and corporations in other Latin American countries, was $40.7 million, or less than 1.5%, of our total loans, at December 31, 2024.

If our policies, procedures and systems are deemed deficient or fail to prevent violations of law or the policies, procedures and systems of the financial institutions that we may acquire in the future are deficient, we would be subject to liability (including fines); formal regulatory enforcement actions (including possible cease and desist orders, restrictions on our ability to pay dividends, regulatory limitations on implementing certain aspects of our business plan, including acquisitions or banking center relocation or expansion); and additional expenses to cure any deficiency, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
Failures to comply with the fair lending laws, CFPB regulations or the Community Reinvestment Act, or CRA, could adversely affect us.
The Bank is subject to the provisions of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, or ECOA, and the Fair Housing Act, both of which prohibit discrimination based on race or color, religion, national origin, sex and familial status in any aspect of a consumer, commercial credit or residential real estate transaction.  Failures to comply with ECOA, the Fair Housing Act and other fair lending laws and regulations, including CFPB regulations, could subject us to enforcement actions or litigation, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Our Bank is also subject to the CRA, and periodic CRA examinations by the OCC.  The CRA requires us to serve our entire communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods.  Our CRA ratings could be adversely affected by actual or alleged violations of the fair lending or consumer financial protection laws. Violations of fair lending laws or if our CRA rating falls to less than “satisfactory” could adversely affect our business, including expansion through branching or acquisitions.
Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock
Our principal shareholders and management own a significant percentage of our shares of voting common stock and will be able to exert significant control over matters subject to shareholder approval.
As of December 31, 2024, our executive officers, directors and each of the 5% or greater holders of our voting Class A common stock beneficially owned outstanding shares representing, in the aggregate, approximately 36% of the outstanding shares of our voting Class A common stock (without giving effect to the broad family holdings of the Capriles, Marturet and Vollmer families which will bring the percentage to an aggregate of approximately 57%).  As a result, these shareholders, if they act individually or together, may exert a significant degree of influence over our management and affairs and over matters requiring shareholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions, such as mergers, the sale of substantially all of our assets and other extraordinary corporate matters. Furthermore, the interests of these shareholders may not always coincide with the interests of other shareholders, including you and, accordingly, they could cause us to enter into transactions or agreements which we might not otherwise consider or prevent us from adopting actions that we might otherwise implement. 
The rights of our common shareholders are subordinate to the holders of any debt securities that we have issued or may issue from time to time.
We have outstanding debt instruments that rank senior to our common stock, if we fail to timely make principal and interest payments on any of these debt instruments, we may not pay any dividends on our common stock. Further, if we declare bankruptcy, dissolve, or liquidate, the holders of these debt instruments  must be satisfied before any distributions can be made to the holders of our common stock.
The stock price of financial institutions, like Amerant, may fluctuate significantly.
We cannot predict the prices at which our shares of common stock will continue to trade. You should consider an investment in our common stock to be risky. The trading price may be highly volatile, which may make it difficult for you to resell your shares at the volume, prices and times desired. There are many factors that may affect 
61
Table of 
Contents
 
the market price and trading volume of our shares of common stock, including the factors described in this “Risk Factors” section, and other factors, most of which are outside of our control.
 Stock markets in general have experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company or industry. These broad market fluctuations, as well as general economic, systemic, political and market conditions, including recessions, loss of investor confidence, and interest rate changes, may negatively affect the market price of our common stock. Increased market volatility may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock, which could make it difficult to sell your shares at the volume, prices and times desired. 
If at a specific measurement time period, our public float calculation is below $700 million, we may not qualify as a well-known seasoned issuer and suffer negative consequences. If we do not qualify as a well-known seasoned issuer, we will not be able to file automatic shelf registration statements on Form S-3ASR and enjoy the benefits associated with such registration statements, such as automatic effectiveness immediately upon filing, permitting companies to omit more information from the base prospectus than permitted for other shelf registration statements, allowing companies to register unspecified amounts of securities and doing so without allocating among securities or between primary and secondary offerings, and permitting companies to pay filing fees on a “pay-as-you-go” basis at the time of each takedown from the shelf registration statement. Not qualifying as a well-known seasoned issuer may also impact the views or perceptions of investors and analysts and may influence investors’ willingness to purchase or hold our securities or analysts’ recommendations regarding our securities.
We can issue additional equity securities, which would lead to dilution of our issued and outstanding Class A common stock.
The issuance of additional equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities would result in dilution of our existing shareholders’ equity interests. We are authorized to issue up to 250 million shares of our Class A common stock. We are authorized to issue, without shareholder approval, up to 50 million shares of preferred stock in one or more series, which may give other shareholders dividend, conversion, voting, and liquidation rights, among other rights, which may be superior to the rights of holders of our Class A common stock. We are authorized to issue, without shareholder approval, except as required by law or the New York Stock Exchange, securities convertible into either common stock or preferred stock. Furthermore, we have adopted an equity compensation program for our employees and an employee stock purchase plan, which also could result in dilution of our existing shareholders’ equity interests. 
Certain provisions of our amended and restated articles of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, Florida law, and U.S. banking laws could have anti-takeover effects.
Certain provisions of our amended and restated articles of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, as well as Florida law, and the BHC Act, and Change in Bank Control Act, could delay or prevent a change of control that you may favor. Our amended and restated articles of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws include certain provisions that could delay a takeover or change in control of us, including: the exclusive right of our board to fill any director vacancy; advance notice requirements for shareholder proposals and director nominations; provisions limiting the shareholders’ ability to call special meetings of shareholders or to take action by written consent; and the ability of our board to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred stock without shareholder approval, which could be used, among other things, to institute a rights plan that would have the effect of significantly diluting the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer, likely preventing acquisitions that have not been approved by our board.
The Florida Business Corporation Act contains a control-share acquisition statute that provides that a person who acquires shares in an “issuing public corporation,” as defined in the statute, in excess of certain specified thresholds generally will not have any voting rights with respect to such shares, unless such voting rights are approved by the holders of a majority of the votes of each class of securities entitled to vote separately, excluding shares held or controlled by the acquiring person. Furthermore, the BHC Act and the Change in Bank Control Act

impose notice, application and approvals and ongoing regulatory requirements on any shareholder or other party that seeks to acquire direct or indirect “control” of bank holding companies, such as ourselves. 
Risks Related to our Indebtedness
We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our debt, including the Subordinated Notes and the Debentures.
As of December 31, 2024, we had outstanding an aggregate principal amount of $
60.0
 million of senior notes with a coupon rate of 5.75% and a maturity date of June 30, 2025 (the “Senior Notes”); an aggregate principal amount of  $
30.0
 million of 4.25% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due March 15, 2032 (the “Subordinated Notes”); and an aggregate principal amount of $64.2 million in junior subordinated debentures (the “Debentures”). We have exercised our right under the applicable indenture to redeem the Senior Notes, which we expect to complete on April 1, 2025, see “
Redemption of Senior Notes
” in Item 1. Business Developments. Once we complete the early redemption of our Senior Notes, the aggregate principal balances of our Subordinated Notes and the Debentures will remain outstanding. 
Our ability to make scheduled payments of principal and interest or to satisfy our obligations in respect of our Subordinated Notes and the Debentures or to refinance them will depend on our future operating performance. Prevailing economic conditions (including inflationary pressures, rising interest rates, and uncertainty surrounding global markets), regulatory constraints (including limitations on distributions to us from our subsidiaries and required capital levels with respect to our subsidiary bank and non-banking subsidiaries), and financial, business and other factors will also affect our ability to meet these needs. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows from operations, or obtain future borrowings in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt, or to fund our other liquidity needs. We may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity. We may be unable to refinance any of our debt when needed on commercially reasonable terms or at all.
We are a holding company with limited operations and depend on our subsidiaries for the funds required to make payments of principal and interest on the Subordinated Notes and the Debentures.
We are
 
a separate and distinct legal entity from the Bank and our other subsidiaries. Our primary source of funds to make payments of principal and interest on the Subordinated Notes and the Debentures, and to satisfy any other financial obligations are dividends from the Bank. Our ability to receive dividends from the Bank is contingent on a number of factors, including the Bank’s ability to meet applicable regulatory capital requirements, the Bank’s profitability and earnings, and the general strength of its balance sheet. Various federal and state regulatory provisions limit the amount of dividends bank subsidiaries are permitted to pay to their holding companies without regulatory approval. In general, the Bank may only pay dividends either out of its net income after any required transfers to surplus or reserves have been made or out of its retained earnings. In addition, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC have issued policy statements stating that insured banks and bank holding companies generally should pay dividends only out of current operating earnings.
Banks and their holding companies are required to maintain a capital conservation buffer of 2.5% and satisfy other applicable regulatory capital ratios. Banking institutions that do not maintain capital in excess of the capital conservation buffer may face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and executive compensation . Accordingly, if the Bank fails to maintain the applicable minimum capital ratios and the capital conservation buffer, dividends to us from the Bank may be prohibited or limited, and there may be insufficient funds to make principal and interest payments on the Subordinated Notes and the Debentures.
In addition, state or federal banking regulators have broad authority to restrict the payment of dividends, including in circumstances where a bank under such regulator’s jurisdiction engages in (or is about to engage in) unsafe or unsound practices. Such regulators have the authority to require that a bank cease and desist from unsafe and unsound practices and to prevent a bank from paying a dividend if its financial condition is such that the regulator views the payment of a dividend to constitute an unsafe or unsound practice.
63
Table of 
Contents
 
Accordingly, we can provide no assurance that we will receive dividends from the Bank in an amount sufficient to pay the principal of, or interest on, the Subordinated Notes and the Debentures. In addition, our right and the rights of our creditors, including holders of the Subordinated Notes and the Debentures to participate in the assets of any non-guarantor subsidiary upon its liquidation or reorganization would be subject to the prior claims of such non-guarantor subsidiary’s creditors, except to the extent that we may ourselves be a creditor with recognized claims against such non-guarantor subsidiary.
We may incur a substantial level of debt that could materially adversely affect our ability to generate sufficient cash to fulfill our obligations under the Subordinated Notes and the Debentures.
Neither we, nor any of our subsidiaries, are subject to any limitations under the terms of the indentures governing the terms of the Subordinated Notes and the Debentures from issuing, accepting or incurring any amount of additional debt, deposits or other liabilities, including senior indebtedness or other obligations ranking equally with the Subordinated Notes and the Debentures. We expect that we and our subsidiaries will incur additional debt and other liabilities from time to time, and our level of debt and the risks related thereto could increase. 
A substantial level of debt could have important consequences to us, holders of our Subordinated Notes, of our Debentures and our shareholders, including making it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations (including the Subordinated Notes and the Debentures); requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing funds available for other purposes; increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions, which could place us at a disadvantage relative to our competitors that have less debt; limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate; and limiting our ability to borrow additional funds, or to dispose of assets to raise funds, if needed, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other corporate purposes.
In addition, a breach of any of the restrictions or covenants in our existing debt agreements could cause a cross-default under other debt agreements. A significant portion of our debt then may become immediately due and payable. If this were to occur, we cannot assure you we would have or be able to obtain sufficient funds to make these accelerated payments. If any of our debt is accelerated, our assets may not be sufficient to repay such debt in full.
Item 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS

Item 1C. CYBERSECURITY
We recognize the security of our banking operations is critical to protecting our customers, maintaining our reputation and preserving the value of the Company. We have an enterprise risk management framework that is designed to identify, measure, control, monitor and mitigate risks across various aspects of our business and operations, including, credit, interest rate, liquidity, operational, regulatory compliance, strategic, reputational, and legal risks.
 As we rely and continue to increase our reliance on technology and given the constant state of cyber threats, information security or cybersecurity is a significant component of our enterprise risk management framework. 
Our Chief Information Security Officer, a key member of our risk management organization, who has overall responsibility, accountability, and ownership for this cybersecurity component, reports directly to the Chief Risk Officer and periodically presents reports to the Risk Committee of our Board of Directors.
 
We are actively engaged in identifying, managing, and mitigating cybersecurity risks with the objective of avoiding or minimizing the impact of malicious and non-malicious actions and threats aimed at penetrating, disrupting or misusing our systems and information. Protecting company data, non-public customer and employee data, and the systems that collect, process, and maintain this information is deemed critical. We have developed and implemented an enterprise-wide information security program, which is designed to protect the availability, integrity, and confidentiality of customer non-public information and company data, including the protection of the hardware and infrastructure used to store and transmit such information. Our Information Security Program is structured and aligned with the Federal Financial Institution Examination Council (“FFIEC”) guidelines for information security, regulatory guidance, and other industry standards. To promote the continued effectiveness of our information security program, we periodically conduct risk assessments, complete audits and tests, participate in industry associations, and review information from threat intelligence feeds. In addition, our Chief Information Security Officer and members of his team and of our Information Technology team regularly collaborate with external parties, including regulatory agencies, other banks and industry groups to share cyberthreat information, trends and issues and identify best practices. 
We leverage knowledge, people, processes, and technology to develop, implement, manage, and maintain cybersecurity controls. Our information security program employs several detective and defensive tools designed to monitor, alert, and block suspicious activity, as well as to identify, report and address any suspected threats. Our information security program is a continuous on-going periodically updated program that is supported by policies, procedures, standards and guidelines; an Enterprise-wide Vendor Management Program; a Technology Project Management Office (PMO) and an Enterprise-wide Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Program. This integration is aimed at ensuring that program is embedded into the
 
organization’s lines of business, support functions and third-party vendor management program.
We have implemented controls that align information security standards with the nature of our operations and strategic direction. When possible, we implement layered control systems by deploying different controls at different points of business processes and throughout an IT system so that the strength of one control can compensate for weaknesses in or possible failure of another control. 
We have also developed an enterprise-wide vendor management and third-party risk management program designed to identify, assess, and manage information security, operational and technology risks associated with third-party vendors.
 Our Enterprise-wide Vendor Management Program is in alignment with the FFIEC Guidelines for Third Party Service Providers and is designed to identify, assess, and manage risks, including cybersecurity risks, associated with external service providers.
 Our Information Security Program also continuously promotes cybersecurity awareness and culture across the organization, including regular education and training, that requires team members to complete training and certification on an annual basis and phishing simulations (attempts of attacks) monthly. New hires are also provided with information security awareness training during the orientation process. A customer security awareness and communication program has also been developed and implemented to keep customers abreast of security and fraud risks.
65
While we believe that our business, financial condition, or results of operations have not been materially adversely affected by any cybersecurity incidents, cybersecurity threats are common and pervasive and, we, as well as our customers, regulators, and service providers, have experienced and will likely continue to experience a significant increase in information security and cybersecurity threats and attacks
, see “Our information systems are exposed to cybersecurity threats and may experience interruptions and security breaches that could adversely affect our business and reputation” in Item 1A. Risk Factors. We continuously assess the risks and changes in the cyber environment and update our information security program to reflect the results of risk assessments and the key controls necessary to safeguard customer information and ensure the proper disposal of customer information. The program is updated considering changes in technology, the sensitivity of our customer information, internal or external threats to information, and our own changing business environment which can include mergers and/or acquisitions, outsourcing arrangements, and changes in customer information systems which may have material impact on the program. We also leverage control testing of key controls, systems, and procedures of our information security program performed by internal and external auditors and external partners, that is periodically completed to assess their design and operating effectiveness and make recommendations to strengthen our risk management program.
We have developed and maintain an incident response plan that provides a documented procedure to respond and address cybersecurity incidents, including timely notification to the Executive Management Committee and the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors. The incident response plan provides for the interaction and coordination of executive, strategic and tactical teams, depending on the severity level of the incident, aimed at facilitating coordination across multiple units and departments of the Company. Our incident response plan is tested at least annually.
Governance
The Information Security Department, under the leadership of the 
Chief Information Security Officer
, has the responsibility for implementation and monitoring our information security program.
 The responsibilities of this department include cybersecurity risk assessments, vulnerability management, access reviews for systems and applications, incident response and management, gathering and sharing threat intelligence, monitoring of controls, and overall responsibility for the development of the information security program including relevant policies, procedures, standards and guidelines to enhance data security and mitigate risks.
 
Members of this department include individuals with varying degrees of education and experience, in particular, our Chief Information Security Officer has over twenty seven years of experience in information technology and risk management, with emphasis on information security and cyber security risk management; throughout his career he has served in different positions including as Information Technology Auditor, Technology Risk Manager, Information Security Program Manager and, since September 2018 as our CISO. He has a bachelor’s degree in computer systems analysis and has obtained several relevant certifications, including having completed the EC-Council’s Certified Chief Information Security Officer Program and obtaining the Information Systems Auditor and Risk and Information Systems Control certifications from the Information Systems Audit and Control Association, ISACA.
 Several management committees, including our Executive Management Committee, manage our information security program and meet periodically to review and discuss information security matters. In general, summaries of key matters discussed are reported to the Risk Committee.
Our Board, through the Risk Committee, is actively engaged in the oversight of our information security program. The Risk Committee oversees our information security program, including management’s actions to identify and evaluate, material cyber vulnerabilities, threats, and risks as well as the development and implementation of mitigating and remediating actions.
 Our Chief Information Security Officer presents quarterly reports to the Risk Committee regarding our information security program, including relevant information on key risk and performance indicators related to cybersecurity matters as well as significant cybersecurity and privacy events. In addition, our information security risk profile is presented to the Risk Committee on a semi-annual basis.

Item 2. PROPERTIES
   We conduct our business from our approximately 177,000 square foot headquarters building in Coral Gables, FL (the “Headquarters Building”), located at 220 Alhambra Circle, Coral Gables, FL 33134. In 2021, we sold the Headquarters Building, and leased-back the property for an eighteen-year term.  In January 2024, we leased to a third-party approximately 19,000 square feet which we previously occupied. As a result, as of December 31, 2024 we occupied approximately 42,000 square feet, or approximately 23%, of the Headquarters Building, with the remaining approximately 135,000 square feet, or approximately 77%, either leased to third-parties or available for lease.
Additionally, a significant portion of our support service units operate out of our new operations center in the Miramar Park of Commerce (the “Miramar Operations Center”), located at 10500 Marks Way, Miramar, FL 33025. The Miramar Operations Center has a more efficient layout which allowed us to reduce our space to approximately 56,500 square feet from approximately 100,000 at the previous operations center. 
As of December 31, 2024, we had 19 banking centers, all located in Florida.  We occupy 15 banking centers under lease agreements with renewal options, two banking centers with long term ground leases, and two banking centers are owned. Our banking centers range from approximately 1,000 square feet to approximately 7,000 square feet, average of 3,300 square feet and total approximately 64,000 square feet. We opened a new banking center in Tampa, FL in 2024, which we also lease.
We lease approximately 6,000 square feet in New York City, which was used as an LPO for CRE loans.  We closed our New York CRE LPO in 2021, and subsequently subleased this property in January 2022. In February 2023, the Company executed a new lease for 14,416 square feet office space in Tampa, FL, which now houses our recently opened banking center and where our new Tampa Regional Office is. In October 2023, the Company leased 12,702 square feet in Plantation, FL, for our Broward county regional office. In June 2024, we also leased 5,172 square feet in West Palm Beach, FL, which will have a new banking center and the West Palm Beach county regional office.
Our various leases have periodic escalation clauses and may have options for extensions and other customary terms.

Item 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
From time to time, in the ordinary course of business, we are involved in litigation, regulatory matters and other legal proceedings. These may include, but are not limited to, claims related to the ownership of funds in specific accounts, disputes over credit relationships, challenges to security interests in collateral, and foreclosure proceedings, employment-related claims and general tort matters. Such matters are incidental to our regular banking and lending operations. 
While the outcome of legal proceedings is inherently uncertain, based on management’s current assessment and legal counsel’s advice, we do not believe that any pending litigation will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
 
Where appropriate, we establish reserves for potential losses in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 450, Contingencies, considering available information, management’s judgment and legal counsel’s guidance. 
At least quarterly, we evaluate legal contingencies using the most current information available. If a loss is probable and reasonably estimable, we record a liability in our consolidated financial statements, adjusting reserves as necessary to reflect new developments. If the likelihood of loss is not probable or cannot be reasonably estimated, no reserve is recorded. 
Based on current information, including insurance coverage, existing legal reserves, and ongoing legal assessments, we do not believe that liabilities arising from pending legal proceedings will materially impact our financial condition. However, due to the inherent uncertainty in litigation and regulatory matters, the final resolution of one or more cases can have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows in a particular reporting period.

PART II
Item 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES
Market For Capital Stock
Our shares of Class A common stock, par value $0.10 per share, are listed and trade on the NYSE under the  symbol “AMTB”. 
Holders of record
As of February 27, 2025, there were 382 shareholders of record of the Company’s Class A common stock. The shareholders of record include Cede & Co., a nominee for The Depository Trust Company, or DTC, which holds shares of our Class A common stock on behalf of an indeterminate number of beneficial owners. All of the Company’s shares of Class A held by brokerage firms, banks and other financial institutions as nominees for beneficial owners are deposited into participant accounts at DTC, and are considered to be held of record by Cede & Co. as one shareholder. Because many of our Class A common stock are held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of shareholders, we are unable to estimate the total number of shareholders represented by these holders.
Dividends
 In January 2025 and each of the four quarters of 2024 and 2023, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.09 per share of the Company’s Class A common stock. Future dividends, if any, will be subject to our Board of Directors’ discretion and will depend on a number of factors including, among other things, upon our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, capital adequacy, cash requirements, prospects, regulatory capital limitations, and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant as well as applicable federal and state regulations. Under Florida law, the Company may only pay dividends if after giving effect to each dividend the Company would be able to pay its debts as they become due and the Company’s total assets would exceed the sum of its total liabilities plus the amount that would be needed, if the Company were to be dissolved at the time of each dividend, to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of shareholders whose preferential rights are superior to those entitled to receive the dividend. In addition, as a bank holding company, our ability to pay dividends is affected by the policies and enforcement powers of the Federal Reserve. Also, because we are a bank holding company, we are dependent upon the payment of dividends by the Bank to us as our principal source of funds to pay dividends in the future, if any, and to make other payments.  The Bank is also subject to various legal, regulatory and other restrictions on its ability to pay dividends and make other distributions and payments to us. For further information,

 “Supervision and Regulation—Payment of Dividends and Repurchases.”

Overview
Our Company
We are a bank holding company headquartered in Coral Gables, FL. We provide individuals and businesses a comprehensive array of deposit, credit, investment, wealth management, retail banking, mortgage services, and fiduciary services. We serve customers in our United States markets and select international customers. These services are offered through the Bank, which is also headquartered in Coral Gables, FL, and its subsidiaries. Fiduciary, investment, wealth management and mortgage lending services are provided by the Bank’s securities broker-dealer, Amerant Investments, and the mortgage company, Amerant Mortgage. The Bank’s primary markets are South Florida, where we are headquartered and operate 18 banking centers in Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties. The Bank also operates one banking center, as well as a regional headquarter, in Tampa, FL. 
See
 “Item1-Business”  for recent developments.
Primary Factors Used to Evaluate Our Business
Results of Operations.
 In addition to net income or loss, the primary factors we use to evaluate and manage our results of operations include net interest income, noninterest income and expenses, and indicators of financial performance including return on assets (“ROA”) and return on equity (“ROE”).  We also use certain non-GAAP financial measures in the internal evaluation and management of our businesses.
Net Interest Income.
 Net interest income represents interest income less interest expense. We generate interest income from interest, dividends and fees received on interest-earning assets, including loans and investment securities we own. We incur interest expense from interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities, including interest-bearing deposits, and borrowings such as FHLB advances and other borrowings such as repurchase agreements,  notes, debentures and other funding sources we may have from time to time. Net interest income typically is the most significant contributor to our revenues and net income. To evaluate net interest income, we measure and monitor: (i) yields on our loans and other interest-earning assets; (ii) the costs of our deposits and other funding sources; (iii) our net interest spread; (iv) our net interest margin, or NIM; and (v) our provisions for credit losses. Net interest spread is the difference between rates earned on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. NIM is calculated by dividing net interest income for the period by average interest-earning assets during that same period. Because noninterest-bearing sources of funds, such as noninterest-bearing deposits and stockholders’ equity, also fund interest-earning assets, NIM includes the benefit of these noninterest-bearing sources of funds. Non-refundable loan origination fees, net of direct costs of originating loans, as well as premiums or 
72
Table of Contents
 
discounts paid on loan purchases, are deferred and recognized over the life of the related loan as an adjustment to interest income in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).
Changes in market interest rates and the interest we earn on interest-earning assets, or which we pay on interest-bearing liabilities, as well as the volumes and the types of interest-earning assets, interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing liabilities and stockholders’ equity, usually have the largest impact on periodic changes in our net interest spread, NIM and net interest income. We measure net interest income before and after the provision for credit losses. 
Noninterest Income.
 Noninterest income consists of, among other revenue streams: (i) service fees on deposit accounts; (ii) income from brokerage, advisory and fiduciary activities; (iii) benefits from and changes in cash surrender value of bank-owned life insurance, or BOLI, policies; (iv) card and trade finance servicing fees; (v) securities gains or losses; (vi) net gains and losses on early extinguishment of FHLB advances which we may execute from time to time as part of asset/liability management activities; (vii) income from derivative transaction with customers; (viii) derivative gains or losses; (ix) gains or losses on the sale of properties ; and (x) other noninterest income which includes mortgage banking revenue. 
See
 “Item 1- Business” for more details.
Our income from service fees on deposit accounts is affected primarily by the volume, growth and mix of deposits we hold and volume of transactions initiated by customers (i.e. wire transfers). These are affected by prevailing market pricing of deposit services, interest rates, our marketing efforts and other factors.
Our income from brokerage, advisory and fiduciary activities consists of brokerage commissions related to our customers’ trading volume, fiduciary and investment advisory fees generally based on a percentage of the average value of assets under management and custody (“AUM”), and account administrative services and ancillary fees during the contractual period. 
Income from changes in the cash surrender value of our BOLI policies represents the amounts that may be realized under the contracts with the insurance carriers, which are nontaxable. In the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company restructured certain of its BOLI contracts, by surrendering existing lower-yielding policies and reinvesting the proceeds in higher-yielding policies. This transaction is expected to increase income from this source beginning in 2024.
 Interchange fees, other fees and revenue sharing are recognized when earned. Trade finance servicing fees, which primarily include commissions on letters of credit, are generally recognized over the service period on a straight line basis. Card servicing fees include credit and debit card interchange fees and other fees. We have also entered into referral arrangements with recognized U.S.-based card issuers, which permit us to serve our customers and earn referral fees and share interchange revenue without exposure to credit risk. In 2024, the Company discontinued one of these arrangements which served international customers, primarily. This is expected to cause a decrease in this revenue source prospectively.  
Our gains and losses on sales of securities are derived from sales from our securities portfolio and are primarily dependent on changes in U.S. Treasury interest rates and asset liability management activities. Generally, as U.S. Treasury rates increase, our securities portfolio decreases in market value, and as U.S. Treasury rates decrease, our securities portfolio increases in value. We also recognize unrealized gains or losses on changes in the valuation of  marketable equity securities not held for trading. 
Our fee income generated on customer interest rate swaps and other loan level derivatives are primarily dependent on volume of transactions completed with customers and are included in noninterest income.
Derivatives unrealized net gains and derivatives unrealized net losses are primarily derived from changes in market value of uncovered interest rate caps with clients.

Other noninterest income includes mortgage banking income generated through our subsidiary Amerant Mortgage, and consists of gain on sale of loans, gain on loans market valuation, other fees and smaller sources of income. Mortgage banking income was $6.9 million and $4.5 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. Other income in 2024 also includes $0.5 million of proceeds from BOLI death benefits.
Noninterest Expense.
 Noninterest expenses generally increase as our business grows and whenever necessary to implement or enhance policies and procedures for regulatory compliance, and other purposes.
Noninterest expense consists of: (i) salaries and employee benefits; (ii) occupancy and equipment expenses; (iii) professional and other services fees; (iv) loan-level derivative expenses; (v) FDIC deposit and business insurance assessments and premiums; (vi) telecommunication and data processing expenses; (vii) depreciation and amortization; (viii) advertising and marketing expenses; (ix) other real estate and repossessed assets, net;  (x) contract termination costs, (xi) losses on sale of assets, and (xii) other operating expenses.
Salaries and employee benefits include compensation (including severance expenses which we generally consider non-routine), employee benefits and employer tax expenses for our personnel. Salaries and employee benefits are partially offset by costs directly related to the origination of loans, which are deferred and amortized over the life of the related loans as adjustments to interest income in accordance with GAAP.
Occupancy expense consists of lease expense on our leased properties, including right-of-use or ROU asset impairment charges, and other occupancy-related expenses. Equipment expense includes furniture, fixtures and equipment related expenses. Rental income associated with subleasing portions of the Company’s headquarters building and the subleasing of the New York office space, primarily, is included as a reduction to rent expense under lease agreements under occupancy and equipment cost.
Professional and other services fees include the cost of outsourced services and other professional consulting fees associated with our transition to a new core banking platform,  legal, accounting and related consulting fees, card processing fees, director’s fees, regulatory agency fees, such as OCC examination fees, and other fees related to our business operations. 
 
Loan-level derivative expenses are incurred in back-to-back derivative transactions with commercial loan clients and with brokers. The Company pays a fee upon inception of the back-to-back derivative transactions, corresponding to the spread between a wholesale rate and a retail rate.
Contract termination costs represent estimated expenses to terminate contracts before the end of their terms, and are recognized when the Company terminates a contract in accordance with its terms, generally considered the time when the Company gives written notice to the counterparty within the notification period contractually established, or when Company determines that it no longer derives economic benefits from the contracts. Contract termination costs also include expenses associated with the abandonment of existing capitalized projects which are no longer expected to be completed as a result of a contract termination. Changes to initial estimated expenses to terminate contracts resulting from revisions to timing or the amount of estimated cash flows are recognized in the period of the changes.
Advertising expenses include the costs of promoting the Amerant brand, as well as the costs associated with promoting the Company’s products and services to create positive awareness, or consideration to buy the Company’s products and services. These costs include expenses to produce, deliver and communicate advertisements using available media and technologies, primarily streaming and other digital advertising platforms. Advertising expenses are expensed as incurred, except for media production costs which are expensed upon the first airing of the advertisement.
74
Table of Contents
 
FDIC deposit and business insurance assessments and premiums include deposit insurance, net of any credits applied against these premiums, corporate liability and other business insurance premiums.
Telecommunication and data processing expenses include expenses paid to our third-party data processing system providers and other telecommunication and data service providers, as well as expenses related to the disposition of fixed assets due to the write off of in-development software in 2023.
Depreciation and amortization expense includes the value associated with the depletion of the value on our owned properties and equipment, including leasehold improvements made to our leased properties.
OREO and repossessed assets expense includes 
expenses and revenue (rental income) from the operation of foreclosed property/assets as well as fair value adjustments and gains/losses from the sale of OREO and repossessed assets. 
In 2023, OREO and repossessed assets expense is presented separately in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss). 
In 2022, while OREO valuation expense was presented separately, all other OREO-related expenses were presented as part of other operating expenses 
in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive (loss) income. We had no other repossessed assets (non-real estate) in 2024 or 2022.
Other operating expenses include community engagement, business development and other operational expenses. In addition, in 2023, other operating expense include an impairment charge of $2.0 million on an investment carried at cost and included as part of other assets, as well as other non-routine items. Other operating expenses are partially offset by other operating expenses directly related to the origination of loans, which are deferred and amortized over the life of the related loans as adjustments to interest income in accordance with GAAP.
Noninterest expenses in 2024 and 2023 include salaries and employee benefits, mortgage lending costs and professional and other service fees in connection with Amerant Mortgage’s ongoing business.
Non-routine noninterest expense items include restructuring expenses and other non-routine noninterest expenses. Restructuring expenses are those incurred for actions designed to implement the Company’s business strategy. These actions include, but are not limited to reductions in workforce, streamlining operational processes, promoting the Amerant brand, decommissioning of legacy technologies, enhanced sales tools and training, expanded product offerings and improved customer analytics to identify opportunities.  There were no restructuring expenses in 2024. Other non-routine noninterest expenses include the effect of non-routine items such as the valuation of OREO and loans held for sale, the sale of repossessed assets, and impairment of investments, expenses in connection with the Houston Sale Transaction,  
See “
Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for more information on non-routine noninterest expense items.

Primary Factors Used to Evaluate Our Financial Condition
The primary factors we use to evaluate and manage our financial condition include asset quality, capital and liquidity.
Asset Quality.
 We manage the diversification and quality of our assets based upon factors that include the level, distribution and risks in each category of assets. Problem assets may be categorized as classified, delinquent, nonaccrual, nonperforming and restructured assets. We also manage the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses, or the allowance, the diversification and quality of loan and investment portfolios, the extent of counterparty risks, credit risk concentrations and other factors.
On January 1, 2022, the Company adopted ASC Topic 326 - Financial Instruments - Credit Losses, which replaced the incurred loss methodology with an expected loss methodology that is referred to as the current expected credit loss (“CECL”) methodology. 
See
 Note 1 to the audited consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K for more details on the adoption of CECL by the Company. We review and update our allowance for expected credit losses periodically to calibrate loss estimation models based on our loan volumes, and credit and economic conditions in our markets. The models may differ among our loan segments to reflect their different asset types, and includes qualitative factors, which are updated periodically based on the type of loan and other factors.
Capital.
 Financial institution regulators have established minimum capital ratios for banks and bank holding companies. We manage capital based upon factors that include: (i) the level and quality of capital and our overall financial condition; (ii) the trend and volume of problem assets; (iii) the adequacy of reserves; (iv) the level and quality of earnings; (v) the risk exposures in our balance sheet under various scenarios, including stressed conditions; (vi) the Tier 1 capital ratio, the total capital ratio, the Tier 1 leverage ratio, and the CET1 capital ratio; (vii) the tangible equity ratio, and (viii) other factors, including market conditions.
Liquidity.
 Our deposit base consists primarily of personal and commercial accounts maintained by individuals and businesses in our primary markets and select international core depositors. The Company is focused on relationship-driven core deposits. The Company may also use third party providers of domestic sources of deposits as part of its balance sheet management strategies. We define core deposits as total deposits excluding all time deposits. This definition of core deposits differs from the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council’s (the “FFIEC”) Uniform Bank Performance Report (the “UBPR”) definition of “core deposits,” which exclude brokered time deposits and retail time deposits of more than $250,000.
 See 
“Core Deposits” discussion for more details.
We manage liquidity based upon factors that include the amount of core deposit relationships as a percentage of total deposits, the level of diversification of our funding sources, the allocation and amount of our deposits among deposit types, the short-term funding sources used to fund assets, the amount of non-deposit funding used to fund assets, the availability of unused funding sources, off-balance sheet obligations, the amount of cash and liquid securities we hold, the availability of assets readily convertible into cash without undue loss, the characteristics and maturities of our assets when compared to the characteristics of our liabilities and other factors.  
Seasonality. 
Our loan production, generally, is subject to seasonality, with the lowest volume typically in the first quarter of each year.

__________________
(1)    At December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, potential dilutive instruments consist of unvested shares of restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance stock units. 
See
 Note 23 to our audited annual consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K for details on the dilutive and anti-dilutive effects of the issuance of restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance stock units on earnings per share in 2024, 2023  and 2022. There were no dilutive shares included in earnings per share calculation in 2024 as the Company reported a net loss from operations and their inclusion would have had an anti-dilutive effect. 
2024 compared to 2023
In 2024, net loss attributable to the Company was $15.8 million, or $0.44 loss per diluted share, compared to  net income of $32.5 million, or $0.96 per diluted share, in 2023. The decrease of $48.2 million, or 148.5% , in 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily due to lower noninterest income and lower net interest income. The decrease was partially offset by lower noninterest expense and lower provision for credit losses in the year compared to 2023.
Net interest income was $326.0 million in 2024, a decrease of $0.5 million, or 0.2%, from $326.5 million in 2023. This was primarily due to (i) higher average balances of total deposits, mainly in money market accounts and time deposits,  as well as, (ii) higher average rates on both total deposits and FHLB advances. These results were partially offset by: (i) an increase of 22 basis points in the yield on total interest earning assets, which was partially offset by the effect of higher non-performing assets during the period; (ii) increases of $238.9 million, or 22.7%, $151.1 million, or 2.2%, and $100.3 million, or 31.1%, in the average balances of debt securities available for sale, loans and deposits with banks, respectively, and (iii) lower average balances of FHLB advances.
 See
 “-Net interest Income

for more details.

Table of Contents
 
Noninterest income was $9.9 million in 2024, a decrease of $77.6 million, or 88.7%, compared to $87.5 million in 2023. These results were mainly due to:  (i) higher securities losses as a result of the Securities Repositioning in 2024; (ii) lower gains on the early extinguishment of advances from the FHLB in 2024 compared to 2023; and (iii) having derivative losses in 2024 compared to having gains in 2023. These decreases were partially offset by: (i) the gain on sale of the Houston Franchise; (ii) higher additional income stemming from BOLI policies following the restructuring completed in the fourth quarter of 2023; (iii) higher other noninterest income; (iv) higher loan-level derivative income; (v) higher cards and trade servicing fees; (vi) higher brokerage, advisory and fiduciary fees, and (vii) higher deposits and service fees.  
See
 “-Noninterest Income
” 
for more details.
Noninterest expense was $299.5 million in 2024, a decrease of $11.9 million, or 3.8%, from $311.4 million in 2023. These results were mainly due to:  (i) lower losses on loans held for sale in 2024 compared to 2023; (ii) lower telecommunications and data processing expenses; (iii) lower other operating expenses; (iv) lower contract termination costs; and (v) lower occupancy and equipment expenses. These decreases were partially offset by: (i) higher professional and other service fees; (ii) higher salary and employee benefits; (iii) an increase in OREO expenses due to a $5.7 million valuation expense in 2024; (iv) higher advertising expenses; (v) higher FDIC assessments and insurance expenses; and (vi) higher loan-level derivative expenses. 
See
 “-Noninterest Expense”
 
for more details.
In 2024, noninterest expense included non-routine items of $26.4 million, compared to $66.2 million in 2023. Non-routine items in noninterest expense in 2024 include: (i) $13.9 million in losses in loans held for sale carried at the lower cost or fair value; (ii) $5.7 million in other real estate owned valuation expense; and (iii) Houston Sale Transaction expenses including: $3.4 million in fixed assets impairment as a result of market value adjustments; $3.1 million in legal, broker fees and other costs, and $0.3 million in other intangible impairment charges. In 2023, non-routine items in noninterest expense in 2023 included: (i) losses on loans held for sale which includes a valuation expense of $35.5 million related to the transfer of the Houston CRE loan portfolio from loans held for investment to loans held for sale and a total loss of $7.6 million, including a $5.6 million valuation expense and a $2.0 million loss on sale, related to a New York-based CRE loan held for sale; (ii) a $2.6 million loss on sale of repossessed assets in connection with our equipment-financing activities; (iii) a $2.0 million impairment charge on an investment carried at cost and included as part of other assets; (iv) a $1.7 million goodwill and intangible impairment charge in 2023; and (iv) $1.1 million in expenses related to the enhancement of BOLI during the fourth quarter of 2023. There were no restructuring costs in 2024 while there were $15.6 million in 2023. 
See
 “Our Company - Primary Factors Used to Evaluate Our Business” for detailed information on non-routine items in noninterest expense.

Interest Rates and Operating Interest Differential
Increases and decreases in interest income and interest expense result from changes in average balances (volume) of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, as well as changes in average interest rates. In this table, we present for the periods indicated, the changes in interest income and the changes in interest expense attributable to the changes in interest rates and the changes in the volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. For each category of assets and liabilities, information is provided on changes attributable to: (i) change in volume (change in volume multiplied by prior year rate); (ii) change in rate (change in rate multiplied by prior year volume); and (iii) change in both volume and rate which is allocated to rate.

In March 2022, the Federal Reserve increased its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points as a key tool to help reduce inflationary pressures. This first increase was followed by six additional increases in the Federal Reserve’s benchmark interest rate which resulted in a total increase of 425 basis in 2022. In 2023, there were four additional increases in the Federal Reserve benchmark interest rate, which resulted in a total increase of 100 basis points in 2023. Meanwhile, in 2024, the Federal Reserve cut the benchmark interest rate three times during the year which resulted in a decrease of 100 basis points in 2024.
In 2024 we had higher average balance of loans compared to the same period last year, which we attribute to our relationship-driven culture. In addition, although we have an asset sensitive position, we partially offset the decrease in rates via repricing of the deposits and the loan production during 2024. See discussions further below for more details.
Net interest income
2024 compared to 2023
In 2024, net interest income was $326.0 million, a decrease of $0.5 million, or 0.2%, from $326.5 million in 2023. This was mainly driven by: (i) higher average balances of total deposits, mainly in money market accounts and time deposits; and (ii) higher average rates on both total deposits and FHLB advances. These results were partially offset by: (i) an increase of 22 basis points in the yield on total interest earning assets; (ii) increases of $238.9 million, or 22.7%, $151.1 million, or 2.2%, and $100.3 million, or 31.1%,  in the average balances of debt securities available for sale, loans and deposits with banks, respectively, and (iii) lower average balances of FHLB advances. Net interest margin was 3.58% in  2024, a decrease of 18 basis points from 3.76% in 2023.
 See
 discussions further below for more details.
Interest Income.
 Total interest income was $595.6 million in 2024, an increase of $47.0 million, or 8.6% compared to $548.6 million in 2023. This was primarily driven by a 22 basis points increase in the average yield on total interest earning assets. In addition, there were increases of $238.9 million, or 22.7%, $151.1 million, or 2.2% and $100.3 million, or 31.1%  in the average balances of debt securities available for sale, loans and deposits with banks, respectively. The increases were partially offset by a decrease  in the average balance of debt securities held to maturity. 
See
 “—Average Balance Sheet, Interest and Yield/Rate Analysis” for detailed information.
Interest income on loans in 2024 was $505.5 million, an increase of $30.1 million, or 6.3%, compared to $475.4 million in 2023. This result was primarily due to (i) a 28 basis points increase in average yields, mainly attributable to higher market rates, partially offset by higher non-performing loans in the period, and (ii) an increase of $151.1 million, or 2.2%, in the average balance of loans compared to 2023. The increase in the average balance of loans includes: (i) originations of and purchases of single-family residential and construction loans through Amerant Mortgage and (ii) origination of commercial loans. The increase in average balance of loans was partially offset by the decrease in higher yielding indirect consumer loans.
 See
 “-Average Balance Sheet, Interest and Yield/Rate Analysis” for detailed information.

Table of Contents
 
Interest income on debt securities available for sale was $57.6 million in 2024, an increase of $14.5 million, or 33.7%, compared to $43.1 million in 2023. This was mainly due to: (i) an increase of 37 basis points in average yields, primarily driven by higher market rates obtained through new purchases during the year and (ii) an increase of $238.9 million, or 22.7%, in the average balance of these securities. In 2024, the average balance of accumulated net unrealized loss included in the carrying value of these securities was $84.5 million compared to $118.5 million in 2023. As of December 31, 2024, we no longer have corporate debt securities as part of the available-for-sale portfolio, compared to 26.5% at December 31, 2023. We continue with our strategy to insulate the investment portfolio from prepayment risk. As of December 31, 2024, floating rate investments represent 16.8% of our total investment portfolio compared to 13.3% at December 31, 2023. In addition, the overall duration slightly increased to 5.2 years at December 31, 2024 from 5.0 years at December 31, 2023, which was primarily due to our model anticipating slower mortgage-backed securities prepayments due to higher market rates. 
See
  “Average Balance Sheet, Interest and Yield/Rate Analysis” for detailed information.
Interest income on debt securities held to maturity was $5.6 million in 2024, a decrease of $2.4 million, or 30.0%, compared to $8.0 million in 2023. This was mainly due to a decrease of $71.5 million, or 30.5% in the average balance of these securities in 2024 compared to 2023, as the Company no longer carried these types of debt securities following the Securities Repositioning in 2024. The decrease was partially offset by an increase of 2 basis points in average yields, primarily driven by higher market rates. 
Interest Expense. 
Interest expense was $269.6 million in 2024, an increase of $47.5 million, or 21.4%, compared to $222.1 million in 2023. This was primarily due to: (i) higher cost of total deposits and FHLB advances. In addition, there was an increase of $283.2 million, or 4.0% in the average balance of total interest bearing liabilities, mainly money market accounts and time deposits. 
Interest expense on interest-bearing deposits was $230.9 million in 2024, an increase of $47.2 million or 25.7%, compared to $183.7 million in 2023. This increase was mainly driven by an increase of 58 basis points in the average rates paid on total interest-bearing deposits, and an increase of $330.4 million, or 5.4%, in their average balance. 
See
 below for a detailed explanation of changes by major deposit category:
•
Time deposits
. Interest expense on total time deposits increased $27.0 million, or 34.2%, in 2024 compared to 2023. This was mainly driven by an increase of 79 basis points in the average cost of total time deposits. In addition, there was an increase of $228.2 million, or 11.0%, in the average balance of these deposits, which includes an increase of $210.1 million in customer certificates of deposits (“CDs”) and $18.1 million in brokered time deposits.
•
Interest bearing checking and savings accounts
. Interest expense on total interest bearing checking and savings accounts increased $20.2 million, or 19.3%, in 2024 compared to 2023, mainly due to an increase of 43 basis points in the average costs of these deposits. In addition, there was an increase of $102.1 million, or 2.6% in the average balance of total interest bearing checking and savings accounts in 2024 compared to 2023, mainly driven by higher average domestic personal accounts. These increases in average balances were partially offset by a net decrease of $27.1 million, or 1.4%, in the average balance of international core deposit accounts, including a decrease of $138.9 million or 9.1% in international personal accounts, partially offset by an increase of $111.8 million, or 24.5%, in international commercial accounts.
Interest expense on FHLB advances increased $0.5 million, or 1.7%, in 2024 compared to 2023, mainly due to an increase of 29 basis points in the average rate paid on these borrowings. The increase was offset by $47.6 million or 5.9%, lower average balance on this funding source. In 2024, the Company borrowed $1.5 billion and repaid $1.4 billion of  advances from the FHLB, including early repayments. 
See
 "Capital Resources and Liquidity Management” for more details on the early repayment of advances from the FHLB.

2024 compared to 2023
The Company recorded a provision for credit losses on loans of $57.6 million in 2024, compared to $60.2 million in 2023. 
The 
$57.6 million
 provision for credit losses on loans includes
 $41.1 million to cover charge-offs, $16.7 million in new specific reserves for non-performing loans and $8.1 million due to loan composition and volume changes. These provision requirements were partially offset by a release of $3.9 million due to credit quality and macroeconomic factor updates and a $4.4 million release due to the Houston loan portfolio classification as held-for-sale.
In 2024, total charge-offs totaled $76.4 million, an increase of $16.5 million, or 27.5% compared to $59.9 million in 2023. Charge-offs in 2024 included: (i) $39.6 million related to seven commercial loans; (ii) $24.4 million related to multiple consumer and overdraft loans, primarily purchased indirect consumer loans, and (iii) $12.4 million in connection with multiple smaller commercial and real estate loans.  Charge-offs in 2024 were partially offset by $8.2 million in recoveries, which include $4.2 million related to three commercial loans, $2.6 million related to purchased indirect consumer loans, and $1.4 million related to multiple commercial and consumer loan recoveries. 
 In 2023, charge-offs included: (i) $28.1 million related to multiple consumer loans, primarily purchased indirect consumer loans; (ii) $10.3 million related to one CRE New York-based multifamily loan; (iii) $7.0 million related to a transportation industry commercial loan relationship that was transferred to other repossessed assets in the first quarter of 2023 and subsequently sold in the second quarter of 2023; (iv) $8.0 million related to four commercial loans ranging between $1 million to $3 million; and (v) $6.5 million in connection with multiple smaller commercial and real estate loans. Charge-offs in 2023 were partially offset primarily by: (i) $5.1 million recovery from a commodity trader charged-off in 2017; (ii) a $3.1 million recovery from a Miami-based U.S. coffee trader (“the Coffee Trader”) charged-off in the previous year; (iii) $1.4 million recovery from purchased consumer loans; and (iv) the remaining $2.1 million is due to smaller multiple recoveries. The ratio of net charge-offs over the average total loan portfolio held for investment was 0.99% in 2024 compared to 0.69% in 2023.
We proactively and carefully monitor the Company’s credit quality practices, including examining and responding to patterns or trends that may arise across certain industries or regions.

  (1)         Income from interest rate swaps and other derivative transactions with customers. The Company incurred expenses related to derivative  transactions with customers which are included as part of noninterest expenses under loan-level derivative expense. 
See 
Noninterest Expense section for more details.
(2)    Changes in cash surrender value of BOLI are not taxable. 
(3)    Amounts are primarily in connection with net losses and gains on the sale of debt securities available for sale. In 2024, includes a total net loss of $76.7 million as a result of the Securities Repositioning.  
  (4)         Net unrealized gains and losses related to uncovered interest rate caps with clients.
(5)    Includes: (i) mortgage banking income of $6.9 million,  $4.5 million and $3.4 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, primarily consisting of net gains on sale, valuation and derivative transactions associated with mortgage loans held for sale activity, and other smaller sources of income related to the operations of Amerant Mortgage and (ii) $0.5 million in BOLI death benefits received in 2024. Other sources of income in the periods shown include income from foreign currency exchange transactions with customers and valuation income on the investment balances held in the non-qualified deferred compensation plan.
2024 compared to 2023
Total noninterest income decreased $77.6 million, or 88.7%, in 2024 compared to 2023. These results were mainly due to: (i) higher securities losses as a result of the Securities Repositioning in 2024; (ii) lower gains on the early extinguishment of advances from the FHLB in 2024 compared to 2023; and (iii) having derivative losses in 2024 compared to having gains in 2023. These decreases were partially offset by: (i)  gain on sale of the Houston Franchise; (ii) higher additional income stemming from BOLI policies following the restructuring completed in the fourth quarter of 2023; (iii) higher other noninterest income; (iv) higher loan-level derivative income; (v) higher cards and trade servicing fees; (vi) higher brokerage, advisory and fiduciary fee; and (vii) higher deposits and service fees.

Table of Contents
 
In 2024, the Company recorded total net gains of $1.6 million on the early extinguishment of approximately $814 million of FHLB advances. In 2023, the Company recorded total net gains of $40.1 million on the early extinguishment of approximately $1.7 billion of FHLB advances. 
Other noninterest income increased $3.6 million, or 39.6%, in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily driven by: (i) an increase of $2.3 million or 50.8% in mortgage banking income compared to 2023, and (ii) other combined smaller sources of income of approximately $1.7 million. These increases were offset by lower foreign currency valuation of approximately $0.4 million.
Cards and trade finance servicing fees increased $2.4 million, or 79.8%, in 2024 compared to 2023, mainly driven by higher debit cards interchange fee income.
Deposits and service fees increased $0.8 million, or 4.0%, in 2024 compared to 2023, mainly driven by higher service charge fee income and higher wire transfer fees.
In the third quarter of 2024, the Company initiated a repositioning of the Company’s securities portfolio (the “Securities Repositioning”), which resulted in the Company recording a total pre-tax loss of approximately $68.5 million in the third quarter of 2024. The Company then completed the Securities Repositioning in October 2024, which resulted in an additional pre-tax loss on sale of approximately $8.1 million. 
See
 Note 3 - Securities for additional information on the Company’s securities portfolio. In May 2023, the Company sold a portion of its investment in a corporate debt security held for sale issued by a financial institution, to reduce single point exposure. The Company received proceeds of $0.8 million and realized a pre-tax loss of $1.2 million in connection with this transaction. Additionally, on March 27, 2023, the Company sold one corporate debt security held for sale issued by Signature Bank, N.A in an open market transaction, and realized a pretax loss on sale of approximately $9.5 million in connection with this transaction.  
See “
Securities” for additional information.
Loan-level derivative income increased  $2.5 million, or 53.8%, in 2024 compared to 2023, mainly driven by higher volume of derivative transactions with clients in 2024 compared to 2023.
Brokerage, advisory and fiduciary activity fees increased $0.9 million, or 5.4%, in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily driven by: (i) higher brokerage fees as a result higher trading volumes and (ii) higher advisory income driven by higher market valuations.
Our AUM totaled $2.9 billion at December 31, 2024, an increase of $600.9 million, or 26.3%, from $2.3 billion at December 31, 2023, primarily driven by net new assets as we added a large trust relationship, as well as to increased market valuations, though to a lesser extent.

2024 compared to 2023
Noninterest expense decreased $11.9 million, or 3.8%, in 2024 compared to 2023, mainly due to: (i) lower losses on loans held for sale in 2024 compared to 2023; (ii) lower telecommunications and data processing expenses; (iii) lower other operating expenses; (iv) lower contract termination costs; and (v) lower occupancy and equipment expenses. These decreases were partially offset by: (i) higher professional and other service fees; (ii) higher salary and employee benefits; (iii) an increase in OREO expenses due to a $5.7 million valuation expense in 2024; (iv) higher advertising expenses; (v) higher FDIC assessments and insurance expenses; and (vi) higher loan-level derivative expenses. 
Professional and other services fees increased $16.5 million, or 47.8%, in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily driven by recurring fees in connection with the current  technology provider (FIS), as well as higher legal fees across various projects. This was partially offset by lower consulting and other professional fees that were nonrecurrent related to FIS. 
Other operating expenses decreased $2.9 million, or 14.0%, in 2024 compared to 2023 , mainly driven by: (i) lower business development expenses and the absence in 2024 of investments and goodwill impairments that were recorded in 2023. The decrease was partially offset by broker fees of $1.3 million recorded in 2024 related to the Houston Sale Transaction.
Salaries and employee benefits increased $3.6 million, or 2.7%, in 2024 compared to 2023  mainly driven by: (i) salary increases mainly in connection with new hires in 2024; (ii) higher compensation expense in connection with the Houston Sale Transaction, and (iii) higher insurance and benefit plans. These were partially offset by: (i) lower severance expenses in 2024 compared to last year, and (ii) a decrease in long-term incentive compensation.
FDIC assessments and insurance increased $1.0 million, or 9.2%, in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily driven by higher FDIC assessment rates and higher average assets.
Advertising expenses increased $1.7 million, or 13.1%, in 2024 compared to 2023, mainly due to higher expenses resulting from advertising campaigns based on promotional agreements with professional sports teams.
Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $0.2 million, or 3.5%, in 2024 compared to 2023. This was mainly due to 2023 having higher computer hardware, signage and building depreciation expenses.
91
Table of Contents
 
Telecommunication and data processing expenses decreased $3.3 million, or 21.1%, in 2024 compared to 2023,  primarily due to (i) 2023 having additional expenses related to the write off of in-development software, (ii) less long distance usage in 2024 vs 2023, and (iii) lower ATM processing fees. 
Loan-level derivative expense increased $0.5 million, or 26.7%, in 2024 compared to 2023, mainly driven by  expenses in connection with the unwinding of the swap on a non-performing loan sold.
Other real estate owned and repossessed assets expense increased $2.7 million, or 131.2%, in 2024 compared to 2023. In 2024, we recorded a valuation allowance on an OREO property of approximately $5.7 million, partially offset by $1.8 million in OREO rental income. In 2023, we had $2.6 million in loss on sale of repossessed assets and other real estate valuation expenses which was offset by $1.3 million in OREO rental income in 2023. .

2024 compared to 2023
We recorded an income tax benefit of $8.3 million in 2024 compared to a $10.5 million expense in 2023. The income tax benefit in 2024 resulted from the net loss reported in 2024, while the expense in 2023 was mainly driven by the net income before income taxes in 2023. However, there was a higher effective tax rate in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily driven by higher state and federal income tax benefit in 2024 as a result of net operating losses in 2024 which are carried forward to future years, as well as higher non-taxable BOLI income in 2024 vs 2023. Income tax expense in 2023 included an additional tax expense of $2.8 million in connection with the BOLI restructuring completed in 2023.
As of December 31, 2024, the Company’s net deferred tax asset was $53.5 million, a decrease of $2.1 million, or 3.8% compared to $55.6 million as of December 31, 2023. This decrease was mainly driven by the tax effects of: (i) a decrease in net unrealized holding losses on debt securities available for sale in 2024 primarily in connection with the Securities Repositioning, and (ii) a decrease of $35.5 million in the valuation allowance of loans held for sale carried at the lower of cost or fair value as loans were sold in 2024. These changes were partially offset primarily by the tax effect of federal and state net operating losses in 2024 which can be carried forward indefinitely and the Company believes it is more likely than not that the tax benefit will be realized.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The Company supplements its financial results that are determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) with non-GAAP financial measures, such as “pre-provision net revenue (PPNR)”, “core pre-provision net revenue (Core PPNR)”, “core noninterest income” and “core noninterest expenses”, “tangible stockholders’ equity (book value) per common share”, “tangible common equity ratio, adjusted for net unrealized accumulated losses on debt securities held to maturity”, and “tangible stockholders' equity (book value) per common share, adjusted for net unrealized accumulated losses on debt securities held to maturity”. This supplemental information is not required by or is not presented in accordance with GAAP. The Company refers to these financial measures and ratios as “non-GAAP financial measures” and they should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the GAAP measures presented herein.
We use certain non-GAAP financial measures, including those mentioned above, both to explain our results to shareholders and the investment community and in the internal evaluation and management of our businesses. Our management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures and the information they provide are useful to investors since these measures permit investors to view our performance using the same tools that our management uses to evaluate our past performance and prospects for future performance, especially in light of the additional costs we have incurred in connection with the Company’s restructuring activities that began in 2018 and continued in 2024, and including the effect of non-core banking activities such as the sale of loans and securities (including the Securities Repositioning in 2024) and other repossessed assets, the valuation of securities, derivatives, loans held for sale and other real estate owned and repossessed assets, the early repayment of FHLB advances, impairment of investments, Bank-owned life insurance restructure, and other non-routine actions intended to improve customer service and operating performance, as well as certain non-routine items recorded in 2024 in connection with the Houston Sale Transaction. While we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating our performance, this information should be considered as supplemental and not as a substitute for or superior to the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from similar measures presented by other companies.

As of December 31, 2024, total loans held for investment were $7.2 billion, up $354.9 million, or 5.2%, compared to $6.9 billion at December 31, 2023. Domestic loans held for investment increased $401.9 million, or 5.9%, as of December 31, 2024, compared to December 31, 2023. The increase in total domestic loans held for investment includes net increases of: (i) $290.3 million, or, 19.9%,  in domestic commercial loans; (ii) $174.1 million, or, 7.5%, in domestic CRE loans; (iii) $157.1 million in loans to financial institutions, as we had new lending activity in connection with non-depository financial institutions in 2024; and (iv) $67.0 million, or,  4.7%, in domestic single-family residential loans. These increases were partially offset by decreases of: (i) $168.3 million, or 14.3%, in domestic owner occupied loans, and (ii)  $118.4 million, or 30.4%, in domestic consumer loans, as the Company discontinued the purchases of indirect consumer loans in 2023 and such indirect lending portfolio is set to runoff over time. 
Loans to international customers, primarily from Latin America, declined $46.9 million, or 53.6%, as of  December 31, 2024, compared to December 31, 2023, mainly driven by $41.7 million in connection with a commercial loan relationship now domiciled in the U.S., and paydowns totaling $5.6 million to existing single-family residential loans, partially offset by a $0.2 million increase in consumer loans.
At December 31, 2024 and 2023, there were $42.9 million and $26.2 million, respectively, of mortgage loans held for sale carried at their estimated fair value. In 2024, in connection with mortgage loans held for sale, we originated and purchased approximately $419.1 million, and had proceeds of approximately $380.8 million, mainly from the sale of these loans.
In 2024, the Company added approximately $418.4 million in single-family residential and construction loans through Amerant Mortgage which includes loans originated and purchased from different channels.
As of December 31, 2024, the Company had no loans held for sale carried at the lower of cost or fair value. In 2024, the Company transferred an aggregate of $497.3 million in connection with the Houston Sale Transaction. The Company recorded a valuation allowance of $1.3 million as a result of the transfer in the same period. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the Houston Sale Transaction closed and as a result, the Company sold, at par, all loans held for sale carried at the lower of cost or fair value at the time of sale. The carrying value of the loans at the time of sale was approximately $473.9 million. In addition, on December 27, 2024, we transferred to held for sale and sold business-purpose, investment property, residential mortgage loans with a carrying value of  $71.1 million. These loans had collateral across several states and average interest rate of 7.13%. We recorded a loss on sale of $12.6 million including estimated transaction costs. 
As of December 31, 2023, the Company had $365.2 million in loans held for sale carried at the lower of cost or fair value, which were previously recorded as loans held for investment. In the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company transferred an aggregate of $401.0 million in Houston-based CRE loans held for investment to the loans held for sale category, and recognized a valuation allowance of $35.5 million as a result of the fair value adjustment of these loans.  The Company sold these loans in the first quarter of 2024 and there was no material impact to the Company’s results of operations as a result of this transaction in 2024. In the third quarter of 2023, the Company transferred a New York-based CRE loan held for investment to the loans held for sale category, with an amortized cost of $48.8 million at the time of transfer and recognized a valuation allowance of $5.6 million as a result of the fair value adjustment of this loan. The Company subsequently sold this loan and there was no material impact to the Company’s results of operations as result of this transaction.
As of December 31, 2024, loans under syndication facilities were $393.7 million, an increase of $121.9 million, or  44.9%, compared to $271.8 million at December 31, 2023. 
This was mainly driven by a net increase of $127.1 million in club deals partially offset by a net decrease of $5.2 million of Shared National Credit Facilities (“SNC”).
 As of December 31, 2024,
 there were no SNC loans that financed highly leveraged transactions
, compared to $5.5 million, or 0.1% of total loans, as of December 31, 2023.
 
At December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, loans under syndication facilities held for investment include Shared National Credit facilities of $81.5 million and $86.7 million, respectively.

Table of Contents
 
The following is a brief description of the composition of our loan classes: 
Commercial Real Estate (CRE) loans. 
We provide a mix of variable and fixed rate CRE loans. These are loans secured by non-owner occupied real estate properties and land development and construction loans. 
Loans secured by non-owner occupied real estate properties are generally granted to finance the acquisition or operation of CRE properties. The main source of repayment of these real estate loans is derived from cash flows or conversion of productive assets and not from the income generated by the disposition of the property held as collateral. These mainly include rental apartment (multifamily) properties, office, retail, warehouses and industrial facilities, and hospitality (hotels and motels) properties mainly in South and Central Florida, Tampa, the greater Houston, Texas area and the greater New York City area, especially the five New York City boroughs. Concentrations in these non-owner occupied CRE loans are subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny. 
See
 “Risk Factors— Our concentration of CRE loans could result in further increased loan losses, and adversely affect our business, earnings, and financial condition.” 
Land development and construction loans includes loans for land acquisition, land development, and construction (single or multiple-phase development) of single residential or commercial buildings, loans to reposition or rehabilitate commercial properties, and bridge loans mainly in the South Florida, the greater Houston, Texas area and the greater New York City area, especially the five New York City boroughs. Typically, construction lines of credit are funded based on construction progress and generally have a maturity of three years or less. 
Owner-occupied. 
Loans secured by owner-occupied properties are typically working capital loans made to businesses in the South Florida and the greater Houston, Texas markets. The source of repayment of these commercial owner-occupied loans primarily comes from the cash flow generated by the occupying business and the real estate collateral serves as an additional source of repayment. These loans are assessed, analyzed, and structured essentially in the same manner as commercial loans. 
Single-Family Residential. 
These loans include loans to domestic and foreign individuals and businesses primarily secured by single-family residences in the U.S., including first mortgages on properties mainly located in Florida, home equity and home improvement loans, mainly in South Florida and the greater Houston, Texas markets. These loans have terms common in the industry. However, loans to foreign clients have more conservative underwriting criteria and terms. 
Commercial loans. 
We provide a mix of variable and fixed rate C&I loans. These loans are made to a diverse range of business sizes, from the small-to-medium-sized to middle market and large companies. These businesses cover a diverse range of economic sectors, including manufacturing, wholesale, retail, primary products and services. We provide loans and lines of credit for working capital needs, business expansions and for international trade financing. These loans include working capital loans, asset-based lending, participations in Shared National Credit facilities, or SNCs (loans of $100 million or more that are shared by two or more institutions), purchased receivables and SBA loans, among others. The tenors may be either short term (one year or less) or long term, and they may be secured, unsecured, or partially secured. Typically, lines of credit have a maturity of one year or less, and term loans have maturities of five years or less. 
In addition, the Company originates 
equipment loan and leases through a white-label equipment financing solution launched in the second quarter of 2022.

Table of Contents
 
Commercial loans to borrowers in similar businesses or products with similar characteristics or specific credit requirements are generally evaluated under a standardized commercial credit program. Commercial loans outside the scope of those programs are evaluated on a case-by-case basis, with consideration of any exposure under an existing commercial credit program. The Bank maintains several commercial credit programs designed to standardize underwriting guidelines, and risk acceptance criteria, in order to streamline the granting of credits to businesses with similar characteristics and common needs. Some programs also allow loans that deviate from credit policy underwriting requirements and allocate maximum exposure buckets to those loans. Loans originated through a program are monitored regularly for performance over time and to address any necessary modifications. 
Loans to financial institutions and acceptances.
 These loans primarily include loans to financial institutions and acceptances which are granted mainly to non-depository financial institutions such as mortgage companies and other financial intermediaries. In addition, it includes a cash collateral loan to a depository institution. Loans in this portfolio segment are generally granted for terms not exceeding three years and on a secured basis under the terms of each credit agreement.
Consumer loans and overdrafts. 
These loans include open and closed-end loans extended to domestic and foreign individuals for household, family and other personal expenditures. These loans include automobile loans, personal loans, or loans secured by cash or securities and revolving credit card agreements. These loans have terms common in the industry for these types of loans, except that loans to foreign clients have more conservative underwriting criteria and terms. Beginning in 2020, consumer loans include indirect unsecured personal loans to well qualified individuals we purchased from recognized third parties personal loan originators. However, we are focusing on organic growth and have not been purchasing any new indirect consumer loan production since the end of 2022. All consumer loans are denominated and payable in U.S. Dollars.

Loan Quality
We use what we believe is a comprehensive methodology to monitor credit quality and manage credit concentrations within our loan portfolio. Our underwriting policies and practices govern the risk profile and credit and geographic concentrations of our loan portfolio. We also believe we employ a comprehensive methodology to monitor our intrinsic credit quality metrics, including a risk classification system that identifies possible problem loans based on risk characteristics by loan type, as well as the early identification of deterioration at the individual loan level. We also consider the evaluation of loan quality by the OCC, our primary regulator.
Analysis of the Allowance for Credit Losses
In 2022, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification Topic 326 - Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (ASC Topic 326), which replaced the incurred loss methodology for estimated probable loan losses with an expected credit loss methodology that is referred to as the current expected credit loss (“CECL”) methodology. See “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” later in this document for more details on the methodology for measuring credit losses under the CECL guidance.
The allowance for credit losses, or ACL, is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of loans held for investment to present the net that is expected to be collected throughout the life of the loan. The estimated ACL is recorded through a provision for credit losses charged against income. Management periodically evaluates the adequacy of the ACL to maintain it at a level it believes to be reasonable. 
The Company develops and documents its methodology to determine the ACL at the portfolio segment level.  The Company determines its loan portfolio segments based on the type of loans it carries and their associated risk characteristics. The measurement of expected credit losses considers information about historical events, current conditions,  reasonable and supportable forecasts and other relevant information. Determining the amount of the ACL is complex and requires extensive judgment by management about matters that are inherently uncertain. Re-evaluation of the ACL estimate in future periods, in light of changes in composition and characteristics of the loan portfolio, changes in the reasonable and supportable forecast and other factors then prevailing may result in material changes in the amount of the ACL and credit loss expense in those future periods.
Expected credit losses are estimated on a collective basis for groups of loans that share similar risk characteristics. Factors that may be considered in aggregating loans for this purpose include but are not necessarily limited to, product or collateral type, industry, geography, internal risk rating, credit characteristics such as credit scores or collateral values, and historical or expected credit loss patterns. For loans that do not share similar risk characteristics with other loans such as collateral dependent loans and  modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties, expected credit losses are estimated on an individual basis.
With respect to modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty,  a change to the ACL is generally not recorded upon modification since the effect of these modifications is already included in the ACL given the measurement methodologies used to estimate the ACL. From time to time, the Company may modify loans related to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties by providing multiple types of concessions. Typically, one type of concession, such as a term extension, may be granted initially. If the borrower continues to experience financial difficulty, another concession, such as principal forgiveness, may be granted. When and if principal forgiveness is provided, the amortized cost basis of the asset is written off against the ACL. The amount of the principal forgiveness is deemed to be uncollectible; therefore, that portion of the loan is written off, resulting in a reduction of the amortized cost basis and a corresponding adjustment to the ACL.

Problem Loans.
 Loans are considered delinquent when principal or interest payments are past due 30 days or more. Loans on which the accrual of interest has been discontinued are designated as nonaccrual loans. Once a loan to a single borrower has been placed in nonaccrual status, management reviews all loans to the same borrower to determine their appropriate accrual status. When a loan is placed in nonaccrual status, accrual of interest and amortization of net deferred loan fees or costs are discontinued, and any accrued interest receivable is reversed against interest income. Typically, the accrual of interest on loans is discontinued when principal or interest payments are past due 90 days or when, in the opinion of management, there is a reasonable doubt as to collectability in the normal course of business. When loans are placed on nonaccrual status, all interest previously accrued but not collected is reversed against current period interest income. Payments received on a loan in nonaccrual status are generally applied to its outstanding principal amount, unless there are no doubts on the full collection of the remaining recorded investment in the loan. When there are no doubts on the full collection of the remaining recorded investment in the loan, and there is sufficient documentation to support the collectability of that amount, payments of interest received may be recorded as interest income. A loan in nonaccrual status is returned to accrual status when none of the conditions noted when first placed in nonaccrual status are currently present, none of its principal and interest is past due, and management believes there are reasonable prospects of the loan performing in accordance with its terms. For this purpose, management generally considers there are reasonable prospects of performance in accordance with the loan terms when at least six months of principal and interest payments or principal curtailments have been received, and current financial information of the borrower demonstrates that the borrower has the capacity to continue to perform into the near future. 
 
Allocation of Allowance for Credit Losses
In the following table, we present the allocation of the ACL by loan segment at the end of the periods presented.  The amounts shown in this table should not be interpreted as an indication that charge-offs in future periods will occur in these amounts or percentages. These amounts represent our best estimates of expected credit losses to be collected throughout the life of the loans, at the reported dates, derived from historical events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts at the dates reported. Our allowance for credit losses is established using estimates and judgments, which also consider the views of our regulators in their periodic examinations. Re-evaluation of the ACL estimate in future periods, in light of changes in composition and characteristics of the loan portfolio, changes in the reasonable and supportable forecast and other factors then prevailing may result in material changes in the amount of the ACL and credit loss expense in those future periods. We also show the percentage of each loan class, which includes loans in nonaccrual status.

(1)     Includes (i) indirect consumer loans purchased, and (ii) mortgage loans secured by single-family residential properties located in the U.S in all years presented.
In 2024, the changes in the allocation of the ACL were primarily attributed to reserve requirements for loan charge-offs, loan composition and credit quality changes as well as updated macroeconomic factors.
The ratio of ACL to total loans held for investment decreased in 2024 primarily due to lower reserve requirements on non-performing loans as of December 31, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023, and changes in loan composition and macroeconomic factors on performing loans.

(1)    Loans past due 90 days or more but still accruing.
The increase in nonperforming loans during 2024 was primarily due to certain loans that were downgraded based on updated borrowers’ financial statements received in  2024. See discussion on Classified and Special Mention Loans below for more details.
We recognized no interest income on nonaccrual loans during 2024,  2023 and 2022.
We utilize an asset risk classification system in compliance with guidelines established by the U.S. federal banking regulators as part of our efforts to monitor and improve asset quality. In connection with examinations of insured institutions, examiners have the authority to identify problem assets and, if appropriate, classify them or require a change to the rating assigned by our risk classification system. There are four classifications for problem assets: “special mention,” “substandard,” “doubtful,” and “loss.” Special mention loans are loans identified as having potential weakness that deserve management’s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may, at some future date, result in the deterioration of the repayment prospects of the loan. Substandard assets have one or more defined weaknesses and are characterized by the distinct possibility that the insured institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Doubtful assets have the weaknesses of substandard assets with the additional characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full questionable and there is a high probability of loss based on currently existing facts, conditions and values. An asset classified as loss is not considered collectable and is of such little value that the continuance of carrying a value on the books is not warranted.

CRE and owner-occupied classified loans include a total of $62.3 million in loans that are current and accruing, including: (i) a $40.8 million owner-occupied loan to a customer in the restaurant service sector in Florida, and (ii) a $21.5 million CRE loan to customer in the accommodation service sector in Florida with an additional $5 million with cash collateral kept in ‘pass’.
In February 2025, the Company decided to sell the $40.8 million substandard owner-occupied loan to a customer in the restaurant service sector in Florida. The Company transferred the loan from loans held for investment to loans held for sale, at the lower of cost or fair value, and determined no valuation allowance was required at the time of the transfer.

At December 31, 2024, total potential problem loans increased $61.2 million compared to 2023. This was mainly due to the downgrade to substandard accrual of a $40.8 million loan to a customer in the restaurant service sector in Florida and a downgrade to accrual of a $21.4 million loan to a customer in the accommodations service sector in Florida, and the addition of two residential loans totaling $0.3 million. These increases were offset by the upgrade of a $1.0 million commercial relationship and a $0.3 million residential loan that became current.

Securities
Our investment decision process is based on an approved investment policy and several investment programs. We seek a consistent risk adjusted return through consideration of the following four principles:
•
investment quality;
•
liquidity requirements;
•
interest-rate risk sensitivity; and
•
potential returns on investment
The Bank’s Board of Directors approves the Bank’s and related companies ALCO investment policy and programs which govern the investment process. The ALCO oversees the investment process monitoring compliance to approved limits and targets. The Company’s investment decisions are based on the above-mentioned four principles, other factors considered relevant to particular investments and strategies, market conditions and the Company’s overall balance sheet position. ALCO regularly evaluates the investments’ performance within the approved limits and targets. The Company proactively manages its investment securities portfolio as a source of liquidity and as an economic hedge against declining interest rates whenever appropriate.

In 2024, the Company changed the presentation of its debt securities by type to provide more granular information on the nature of the investments. This includes, among other things, new tabular information on mortgage-backed securities (“MBS”).  Debt securities by type as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 have been reclassified for comparative purposes.
The following table sets forth the book value and percentage of each category of securities at December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.  The book value for debt securities classified as available for sale and equity securities with readily determinable fair value not held for trading represents fair value. The book value for debt securities classified as held to maturity represents amortized cost less allowance for credit losses (“ACL”), if any. The Company adopted CECL in 2022 and determined that an ACL on its debt securities held to maturity as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 was not required. The Company held no securities as held to maturity as of December 31, 2024.

(2)     In 2024, as a result of the Company’s Securities Repositioning strategy, the Company sold its corporate bonds including subordinated debt securities issued by financial institutions. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, corporate bonds in the financial services sector represent 1.9% and 2.3% of our total assets, respectively..
(3)     As of December 31, 2023 and 2022 corporate bonds include $10.5 million and $9.7 million, respectively, in “investment-grade” quality securities issued by foreign corporate entities. The securities issuers were from Canada in two different sectors in 2023 and 2022. The

Company limits exposure to foreign investments based on cross border exposure by country, risk appetite and policy. All foreign investments are denominated in U.S. Dollars. 
 
(4)    Includes securities issued by U.S. government and U.S. government sponsored agencies. In 2024, the Company executed the Securities Repositioning and transferred all its debt securities held to maturity to the available for sale category.
(5)    In 2023, the Company sold  its marketable equity securities with a total fair value of $11.2 million at the time of sale, and recognized a net loss of $0.2 million in connection with this transaction. Also in 2023, the Company purchased an investment in an open-end fund incorporated in the U.S with an original cost of $2.5 million. The Fund's objective is to provide a high level of current income consistent with the preservation of capital and investments deemed to be qualified under the Community Reinvestment Act.
(6)    Includes investments in FHLB and Federal Reserve Bank stock. Amounts correspond to original cost at the date presented.  Original cost approximates fair value because of the nature of these investments.
As of  December 31, 2024, total securities slightly increased $1.0 million, or 0.1%, to $1.5 billion compared to $1.5 billion as of December 31, 2023. The increase in 2024 was mainly driven by purchases of: (i) debt securities available for sale and FHLB stock totaling $786.6 million and (ii) net pre-tax unrealized holding gains on debt securities available for sale of $42.2 million primarily attributable to the reclassification into net loss of net accumulated unrealized losses previously included in AOCL on debt securities available for sale as a result of the Securities Repositioning. The increase was partially offset by maturities, sales, calls and pay downs totaling $746.8 million.
Upon successfully completing the Public Offering, the Company initiated the Securities Repositioning aimed at improving yields, increasing liquidity and de-risking the securities portfolio. As part of this strategy, in the third quarter of 2024, the Company: (i) transferred at their fair value (which was below their amortized cost basis) all of the debt securities previously classified as held to maturity and carried at amortized cost to the debt securities available for sale category; (ii) sold all of the Company’s investments in subordinated debt securities, included in corporate debt securities, which resulted in a pre-tax loss on sale of approximately $6.7 million in the third quarter of 2024; and (iii) decided to sell all other corporate debt securities. In addition, as a result of its decision to sell all debt securities available for sale (including those previously classified as held to maturity) which had accumulated unrealized losses and met the criteria for inclusion in the Securities Repositioning, the Company recorded a pre-tax  impairment loss totaling approximately $61.8 million on debt securities available for sale which resulted in a write down of their previous amortized cost to their estimated fair value as of September 30, 2024. The Company completed the Securities Repositioning in October 2024, which resulted in an additional pre-tax loss on sale of approximately $8.1 million as a result of the subsequent decline in fair market value of the securities.
Debt securities available for sale had net unrealized holding losses of $55.7 million and net unrealized holding gains of $0.9 million at December 31, 2024, compared to net unrealized holding losses of $100.3 million and net unrealized holding gains of $3.2 million at December 31, 2023. In 2024, the Company recorded pre-tax net unrealized holding gains of $42.2 million which are included in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income for the period. The improvement in unrealized holding losses was mainly attributed to the reclassification into net loss of net accumulated unrealized losses previously included in AOCL on debt securities available for sale as a result of the Securities Repositioning.  The Company does not intend to sell these debt securities and it is more likely than not that it will not be required to sell the securities before their anticipated recovery. The Company believes these securities are not credit-impaired because the change in fair value is attributable to changes in interest rates and investment securities markets, generally, and not credit quality. As a result, the Company did not record an allowance for credit losses on these securities as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.
The Company considers that all debt securities held to maturity issued or sponsored by the U.S. government are considered to be risk-free as they have the backing of the U.S. government. The Company considers there are not current expected credit losses on these securities and, therefore, did not record an ACL on any of its debt securities held to maturity as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.  The Company monitors the credit quality of held to maturity securities through the use of credit ratings. Credit ratings are monitored by the Company on at least a quarterly basis. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, all held to maturity securities held by the Company were rated investment grade.

The following table sets forth the book value, scheduled maturities and weighted average yields for our securities portfolio at December 31, 2024. Similar to the table above, the book value for debt securities classified as available for sale and equity securities with readily determinable fair value not held for trading is equal to fair market value. The book value for debt securities classified as held to maturity is equal to amortized cost.

The investment portfolio’s average effective duration in years was 5.2, 5.0 and 4.9 as of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase in effective duration in 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily due to lower than expected mortgage-backed securities prepayments. These estimates are computed using multiple inputs that are subject, among other things, to changes in interest rates and other factors that may affect prepayment speeds. Contractual maturities of investment securities are adjusted for anticipated prepayments of amortizing U.S. government sponsored agency debt and enterprise debt securities, which shorten the average lives of these investments.
 
Goodwill. 
Goodwill was $19.2 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. Goodwill mainly represents the excess of consideration paid over the fair value of the net assets of a savings bank acquired in 2006.
Liabilities
Total liabilities were $9.0 billion at December 31, 2024, an increase of $31.0 million, or 0.3%, compared to $9.0 billion at December 31, 2023.  This was primarily driven by an increase of $100.0 million, or 15.5%, in advances from the FHLB, which included the addition of $1.5 billion of these borrowings, and was partially offset by the $1.4 billion repayment of these borrowings in 2024. The increase was partially offset by: (i) $40.3 million, or 0.5%, in total deposits, mainly due to a decrease in interest bearing demand deposits, as well as time deposits which included deposits that were sold in connection with the sale of the Houston Franchise; (ii) a decrease of $17.1 million, or 13.9%, in operating lease liabilities which includes operating liabilities that were sold in connection with the sale of the  Houston Franchise; and (iii) a net decrease of $12.1 million, or 7.4% in accounts payable and accrued and other liabilities which includes other liabilities that were sold in connection with the sale of the Houston Franchise.

Deposits
We continue with our efforts in growing our deposits. Our efforts include the additions of retail, private and commercial banking team members, which contributed to increasing deposit levels in 2024. 
See
 “Our Company- Business Developments” for additional information.
Total deposits were $7.9 billion at December 31, 2024, a decrease of $40.3 million, or 0.5%, compared to December 31, 2023. The decrease in deposits was mainly due to: (i) a decrease of $331.2 million, or 12.9%, in interest-bearing deposits, which were due to decreases in higher cost municipalities and institutional deposits; (ii) net decrease of  $62.7 million or 2.7%, in time deposits in 2024 compared to 2023, which includes decreases of $45.0 million, or 2.9%, in customer CDs and  $17.7 million, or 2.5%, in brokered time deposits. These decreases were partially offset by increases of: (i) $275.7 million, or 17%, in savings and money market accounts and (ii) $77.8 million, or 5%, in noninterest bearing accounts. 
Domestic deposits decreased $151.8 million, or 2.8%, to $5.3 billion at December 31, 2024 from $5.4 billion at December 31, 2023, while foreign deposits increased $111.5 million, or 4.5%, in 2024 from $2.5 billion at December 31, 2023.

(1)     Domestic deposits, excluding brokered deposits, decreased $116.8 million in 2024 and increased $701.5 million, $1.2 billion and $181.5 million  in 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.
124
Domestic deposits decreased $151.8 million, or 2.8%, in 2024 to $5.3 billion at December 31, 2024 from $5.4 billion at December 31, 2023. This was primarily driven by decreases of: (i) $307.5 million in domestic interest-bearing accounts, (ii) $138.7 million in domestic time deposit accounts and (iii) $7.6 million in domestic brokered time deposits. These decreases were partially offset by increases of: (i) $285.4 million in domestic savings and money market deposits and (ii) $16.6 million in domestic noninterest bearing deposits.
In addition, domestic deposits were impacted by the sale of the Houston Franchise as the sale included $333.2 million in time deposits, $113.3 million in savings and money market deposits, $66.6 million in noninterest bearing demand deposits and $54.6 million in interest-bearing demand deposits. 
Foreign deposits increased $111.5 million, or 4.5%, in 2024 to $2.6 billion at December 31, 2024 from $2.5 billion at December 31, 2023, primarily driven by an increase of $93.2 million, or 15.7%, in deposits from countries other than Venezuela, due to our efforts to grow deposits from customers in those other markets as well as an increase of $18.4 million, or 1.0%, in deposits from customers domiciled in Venezuela.
Core deposits
 Core deposits were $5.6 billion, $5.6 billion and $5.3 billion as of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Core deposits represented 71.6%, 70.9% and 75.5% of our total deposits at those dates, respectively. The increase of $22.4 million, or 0.4%, in core deposits in 2024 was mainly driven by the previously mentioned increase in savings and money market deposits as well as an increase in non-interest bearing deposits. Core deposits consist of total deposits excluding all time deposits. The Company remains focused on relationship-driven deposit gathering activities. 
As mentioned above, core deposits were impacted by the sale of the Houston Franchise as the sale included  $113.3 million in savings and money market deposits, $66.6 million in noninterest bearing demand deposits and $54.6 million in interest-bearing demand deposits. 
Brokered deposits
We utilize brokered deposits primarily as an Asset/Liability Management tool. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had $701.9 million and $736.9 million in brokered deposits, which represented 8.9% and 9.3%, respectively, of our total deposits. Brokered deposits decreased $35.0 million, or 4.7%, in 2024 compared to December 31, 2023, mainly due to a decrease in brokered time and non-time deposits.
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, brokered deposits only included time deposits of $701.9 million, while as of December 31, 2023, brokered deposits included time deposits of $719.5 million and interest bearing demand and money market deposits totaling $17.4 million. The Company has not historically sold brokered CDs in denominations over $100,000.

The decrease in large fund providers in December 31, 2024 was mainly driven by a decrease in higher-cost municipal deposits as the Company continues to focus on depository relationships.

Short-Term Borrowings. 
In addition to deposits, we use short-term borrowings, such as FHLB advances, and less frequently, advances from other banks, as a source of funds to meet the daily liquidity needs of our customers and fund growth in earning assets.  Short-term borrowings have maturities of 12 months or less as of the reported period-end.  
Short-term borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2024 and 2023, matured in January 2025 and 2024, respectively. All of our outstanding short-term borrowings at December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 corresponded to FHLB advances. There were no other borrowings or repurchase agreements outstanding as of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.

 As of December 31, 2024, potential dilutive instruments were not included in the diluted earnings per share computation because the Company reported a net loss and their inclusion would have an anti-dilutive effect in per share earnings in that period. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, potential dilutive instruments consisted of unvested shares of restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance stock units. 
See
 Note 14 to our audited consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K for details on the dilutive effects of the issuance of restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance share units on earnings per share in 2024, 2023 and 2022.
In 2024, the Company had a net loss, compared to net income in 2023. As a result, the Company had basic and diluted losses per share in 2024, compared to earnings per share in 2023. Additionally, in 2024 average common shares increased compared to 2023 primarily as a result of the Public Offering in 2024.
Capital Resources and Liquidity Management
Capital Resources
Stockholders’ equity is influenced primarily by earnings, dividends, if any, and changes in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income or Loss (“AOCI” or “AOCL”) caused primarily by fluctuations in unrealized holding gains or losses, net of taxes, on debt securities available for sale and derivative instruments. AOCI or AOCL are not included for purposes of determining our capital for holding and bank regulatory purposes. 
Stockholders’ equity was $890.5 million as of December 31, 2024, an increase of $154.4 million, or 21.0%,  compared to $736.1 million as of December 31, 2023. This increase was primarily driven by: (i) net proceeds of $155.8 million from the issuance of common stock in the Public Offering completed in 2024, (ii) a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive losses (“AOCL”) of $31.0 million due to the reclassification into net loss of net accumulated unrealized losses previously included in AOCL on debt securities available for sale as a result of the Securities Repositioning completed in 2024, and (iii) a net aggregate of $5.0 million in stock-based incentive compensation programs. The increase was offset by: (i) net loss of $15.8 million in 2024; (ii) $12.8 million of dividends declared and paid by the Company in 2024 and (iii) an aggregate of $7.6 million of Class A common stock repurchased in 2024.
 See 
more details on the stock repurchase program launched in 2023 further below.

Non-controlling Interest
The Company records net loss attributable to Non-controlling interests in its condensed consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss)  equal to the percentage of the economic or ownership interest retained in the interest of Amerant Mortgage, and presents non-controlling interests as a component of stockholders’ equity on the consolidated balance sheets. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had an ownership interest of 100% in Amerant Mortgage. On December 31, 2023, Amerant Mortgage became a wholly-owned subsidiary of 
the Company as it increased its ownership interest to 100% effective as of December 31, 2023. 
 Therefore, the Company did not record any loss or gain attributable to non-controlling interest in 2024 and had no equity attributable to the non-controlling interest at December 31, 2024 and 2023. 
See 
Note 1 to our audited annual consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K for detailed information on changes in ownership interest in Amerant Mortgage.

Liquidity Management
Advances from the FHLB, other borrowings and borrowing capacity
At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had $0.7 billion and $0.6 billion, respectively, of outstanding advances from the FHLB. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company repaid $1.4 billion of outstanding FHLB advances, and borrowed $1.5 billion from this source. 
At December 31, 2024 and 2023 advances from the FHLB had maturities through 2029 and 2028, respectively. At December 31, 2024, advances from the FHLB had fixed interest rates ranging from 3.45% to 5.46% and, a weighted average rate of 4.10% (fixed interest rates ranging from 0.61% to 4.90%, and a weighted average rate of 3.65% at December 31, 2023).

Table of Contents
 
We had $1.6 billion and $1.9 billion of additional borrowing capacity with the FHLB as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This additional borrowing capacity is determined by the FHLB. We also maintain borrowing capacity with the Federal Reserve, and relationships in the capital markets with brokers and dealers to issue FDIC-insured interest-bearing deposits, including certificates of deposits. We also have available uncommitted federal funds credit lines with several banks. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had no outstanding obligations on uncommitted federal funds lines with banks.  
There were no other borrowings as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.
Based on our current outlook, we believe that net income, deposits, advances from the FHLB and available other funding sources will be sufficient to fund liquidity requirements for the next twelve months.
Holding Company
We are a corporation separate and apart from the Bank and, therefore, must provide for our own liquidity. Historically, our main source of funding has been dividends declared and paid to us by the Bank. The Company is the obligor and guarantor on our junior subordinated debt, the Senior Notes and Subordinated Notes. As previously discussed, on September 27, 2024, the Company completed a public offering of its common stock, which resulted in net proceeds to the Company of $155.8 million recorded in 2024. Following the completion of this offering in 2024, the Company contributed cash totaling $90 million to its Bank subsidiary.The Company held cash and cash equivalents of $99.5 million as of December 31, 2024 and $46.8 million as of December 31, 2023, in funds available to service its Senior Notes, Subordinated Notes and junior subordinated debt and for general corporate purposes, as a separate stand-alone entity. 
Based on our current outlook, we believe that available funding sources, including any dividends from the Bank, will be sufficient to fund liquidity requirements for the next twelve months.
Subsidiary Dividends
There are statutory and regulatory limitations that affect the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to the Company. These limitations exclude the effects of AOCI. Management believes that these limitations will not affect the Company’s ability to meet its ongoing short-term cash obligations.
 See 
“Supervision and Regulation” in this Form 10-K.
In December 2023, the Boards of Directors of the Bank approved the payment of a cash dividend of $20 million by the Bank to Amerant Bancorp. The Company received this dividend in the first quarter of 2024. The Bank did not declare any dividends payable to Amerant Bancorp in 2024.
Regulatory Capital Requirements 
We are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the Federal Reserve and OCC. Failure to meet regulatory capital requirements may result in certain discretionary, and possible mandatory actions by regulators that, if taken, could have a direct material effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation. Under the federal capital adequacy rules and the regulatory framework for “prompt corrective action”, we must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of our assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated for regulatory capital purposes. Our capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators, including anticipated capital needs. Supervisory assessments of capital adequacy may differ significantly from conclusions based solely upon the regulations’ risk-based capital ratios. Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require us to maintain minimum CET1, Tier 1 leverage, Tier 1 risk-based capital and total risk-based capital ratios.

The Basel III rules became effective for the Company and the Bank on January 1, 2015 with full compliance with all of the requirements being phased in by January 1, 2019. The Company and the Bank opted to not include the AOCI in computing regulatory capital. As of December 31, 2024, management believes that the Company and the Bank meet all capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject, and are well-capitalized. In addition, Basel III rules required the Company and the Bank to hold a minimum capital conservation buffer of 2.50%. The Company’s capital conservation buffer at year end 2024 and 2023 was 5.4% and 4.1%, respectively, and therefore no regulatory restrictions exist under the applicable capital rules on dividends or discretionary bonuses or other payments.

Effects of Inflation and Changing Prices
The consolidated financial statements and related consolidated financial data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with GAAP and practices within the banking industry, which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical Dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. 
Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution’s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation. However, inflation also affects a financial institution by increasing its cost of goods and services purchased, as well as the cost of salaries and benefits, occupancy expense, and similar items. Inflation and related increases in interest rates generally decrease the market value of investments and loans held and may adversely affect liquidity, earnings, and shareholders’ equity. Loan originations and re-financings also tend to slow as interest rates increase, and higher interest rates may reduce a financial institution’s earnings from such origination activities.  Similarly, lower inflation and rate decreases increase the fair value of securities and loan origination and refinancing tend to accelerate.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We may engage in a variety of financial transactions in the ordinary course of business that, under GAAP, may not be recorded on the balance sheet. Those transactions may include contractual commitments to extend credit in the ordinary course of our business activities to meet the financing needs of customers. Such commitments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit, market and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheets. These commitments are legally binding agreements to lend money at predetermined interest rates for a specified period of time and generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses. We use the same credit and collateral policies in making these credit commitments as we do for on-balance sheet instruments. 
We evaluate each customer’s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis and obtain collateral, if necessary, based on our credit evaluation of the borrower. In addition to commitments to extend credit, we also issue standby letters of credit that are commitments to a third-party in specified amounts of payment or performance, if our customer fails to meet its contractual obligation to the third-party. The credit risk involved in the underwriting of letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending credit to customers. 
      The following table shows the outstanding balance of our off-balance sheet arrangements as of the end of the periods presented.  Except as disclosed below, we are not involved in any other off-balance sheet contractual relationships that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, a change in our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

Contractual Obligations 
In the normal course of business, we and our subsidiaries enter into various contractual obligations that may require future cash payments. Significant commitments for future cash obligations include capital expenditures related to operating leases, certain binding agreements we have entered into for services including outsourcing of technology services, advertising and other services, and other borrowing arrangements which are not material to our liquidity needs. We currently anticipate that our available funds, credit facilities, and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our operational cash needs for the foreseeable future. Other than the changes discussed herein, there have been no material changes to the contractual obligations previously disclosed in the 2023 Form 10-K.
The table below summarizes, by remaining maturity, our significant contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2024. Amounts in this table reflect the minimum contractual obligation under legally enforceable contracts with terms that are both fixed and determinable. All other contractual cash obligations on this table are reflected in our consolidated balance sheet. 
As of December 31, 2024 we had the following contractual cash obligations:

We believe that we will be able to meet our contractual obligations as they come due through the maintenance of adequate liquidity. We expect to maintain adequate liquidity through the results of operations, loan and securities repayments and maturities and continued deposit gathering activities. We also have various borrowing facilities at the Bank to satisfy both short-term and long-term liquidity needs.
In December 2021, the Company became a strategic lead investor in the JAM FINTOP Blockchain fund (the “Fund”). The Company is currently committed to making future contributions to the Fund for a total of $7.5 million at December 31, 2024.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under current circumstances, results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
Accounting policies, as described in detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements, are an integral part of our financial statements. A thorough understanding of these accounting policies is essential when reviewing our reported results of operations and our financial position. We believe that the critical accounting policies and estimates discussed below require us to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. Changes in these estimates, that are likely to occur from period to period, or using different estimates that we could have reasonably used in the current period, would have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
Securities. 
Securities generally must be classified as held to maturity, or HTM, debt securities available-for-sale, or AFS, trading or, equity securities with readily available fair values. Securities classified as HTM are securities we have both the ability and intent to hold until maturity and are carried at amortized cost, less any allowance for credit losses. Trading securities, if we had any, would be held primarily for sale in the near term to generate income. Debt securities that do not meet the definition of trading or HTM are classified as AFS. 
The classification of investment securities is significant since it directly impacts the accounting for unrealized gains and losses on these securities. Unrealized gains and losses on trading securities, if we had any, and equity securities with readily available fair values, would flow directly through earnings during the periods in which they arise. AFS securities are measured at fair value each reporting period. Unrealized gains and losses on AFS securities are recorded as a separate component of shareholders’ equity (accumulated other comprehensive income or loss) and do not affect earnings until realized or deemed to be credit-impaired. Investment securities that are classified as HTM are recorded at amortized cost, and reduced by an estimated amount of expected credit loss during the life of the investment, if any.
For debt securities available for sale, the Company evaluates whether: (i) the fair value of the securities is less than the amortized costs basis; (ii) it intends to sell, or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell, the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, and (iii) the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses or other factors. The Company estimates credit losses on debt securities available for sale using a discounted cash flow model. The present value of an impaired debt security results from estimating future cash flows that are expected to be collected, discounted at the debt security’s effective interest rate. The Company develops its estimates about cash flows expected to be collected and determines whether a credit loss exists, generally using information about past events, current conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts and other qualitative factors including the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost basis, adverse conditions specifically related to the security, industry or geographic area, changes in conditions of any collateral underlying the securities, changes in credit ratings, failure of the issuer to make scheduled payments, among other qualitative factors specific to the applicable security. If a credit loss exists, the Company records an allowance for the credit losses, limited to the amount by which the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. The Company recognizes in AOCI/AOCL a decline in fair value over the carrying amount of AFS securities that has not been recorded through an allowance for credit losses.
Debt securities available for sale are charged off to the extent that there is no reasonable expectation of recovery of amortized cost basis. Debt securities available for sale are placed on non-accrual status if the Company does not reasonably expect to receive interest payments in the future and interest accrued is reversed against interest income. Securities are returned to accrual status only when collection of interest is reasonably assured.
137
Table of Contents
 
Fair Value of Financial Instruments. 
We are, under applicable accounting guidance, required to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs in measuring fair value. We classify fair value measurements of financial instruments based on the three-level fair value hierarchy in the guidance. We carry mortgage loans, AFS debt and other securities, BOLI policies and derivative assets and liabilities at fair value. From time to time, we also have loans held for sale carried at the lower of cost or fair value.
The fair values of assets and liabilities may include adjustments for various factors, such as market liquidity and credit quality, where appropriate. Valuations of products using models or other techniques are sensitive to assumptions used for the significant inputs. Where market data is available, the inputs used for valuation reflect that information as of our valuation date. Inputs to valuation models are considered unobservable if they are supported by little or no market activity. In periods of extreme volatility, lessened liquidity or in illiquid markets, there may be more variability in market pricing or a lack of market data to use in the valuation process. In keeping with the prudent application of estimates and management judgment in determining the fair value of assets and liabilities, we have in place various processes and controls including validation controls, for which we utilize both broker and pricing service inputs. Data from these services may include both market-observable and internally-modeled values and/or valuation inputs. Our reliance on this information is affected by our understanding of how the broker and/or pricing service develops its data with a higher degree of reliance applied to those that are more directly observable and lesser reliance applied to those developed through their own internal modeling. Similarly, broker quotes that are executable are given a higher level of reliance than indicative broker quotes, which are not executable. These processes and controls are performed independently of the business. For additional information, 
see 
Note 18 of our audited consolidated financial statements.
Allowance for Credit Losses
In 2022, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification Topic 326 - Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (ASC Topic 326), which replaced the incurred loss methodology for estimated probable loan losses with an expected credit loss methodology that is referred to as the current expected credit loss (“CECL”) methodology.  The Company adopted the CECL guidance as of the beginning of the reporting period of adoption, January 1, 2022, using a modified retrospective approach for all its financial assets measured at amortized cost and off-balance sheet credit exposures. 
Under the CECL accounting guidance, the Allowance for Credit Losses, or ACL, is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of financial assets, including loans held for investments and debt securities held to maturity, to present the net amount that is expected to be collected throughout the life of those financial assets. The estimated ACL is recorded through a provision for credit losses charged against income. Management periodically evaluates the adequacy of the ACL to maintain it at a level it believes to be reasonable. The Company uses the same methods used to determine the ACL to assess any reserves needed for off-balance sheet credit risks such as unfunded loan commitments and contingent obligations on letters of credit. These reserves for off-balance sheet credit risks are presented in the liabilities section in the consolidated balance sheets.
The Company develops and documents its methodology to determine the ACL at the portfolio segment level.
 
The Company determines its loan portfolio segments based on the type of loans it carries and their associated risk characteristics. The measurement of expected credit losses considers information about historical events, current conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts and other relevant information. Determining the amount of the ACL is complex and requires extensive judgment by management about matters that are inherently uncertain. Re-evaluation of the ACL estimate in future periods, in light of changes in composition and characteristics of the loan portfolio, changes in the reasonable and supportable forecast and other factors then prevailing may result in material changes in the amount of the ACL and credit loss expense in those future periods.
138
Table of Contents
 
Expected credit losses are estimated on a collective basis for groups of loans that share similar risk characteristics. Factors that may be considered in aggregating loans for this purpose include but are not necessarily limited to, product or collateral type, industry, geography, internal risk rating, credit characteristics such as credit scores or collateral values, and historical or expected credit loss patterns. For loans that do not share similar risk characteristics with other loans such as collateral dependent loans and  modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties, expected credit losses are estimated on an individual basis.
Expected credit losses are estimated over the contractual terms of the loans, adjusted for expected prepayments. Expected prepayments for commercial and commercial real estate loans are generally estimated based on the Company's historical experience. For residential loans, expected prepayments are estimated using a model that incorporates industry prepayment data, calibrated to reflect the Company's experience. The contractual term excludes expected extensions, renewals, and modifications unless either of the following applies: management has a reasonable expectation at the reporting date a modification related to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty will be executed, or the extension or renewal options are included in the original or modified contract at the reporting date and are not unconditionally cancellable by the Company.
With respect to modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty,  a change to the ACL is generally not recorded upon modification since the effect of these modifications is already included in the ACL given the measurement methodologies used to estimate the ACL. From time to time, the Company modifies loans by providing principal forgiveness on certain of its real estate loans. When principal forgiveness is provided, the amortized cost basis of the asset is written off against the ACL. The amount of the principal forgiveness is deemed to be uncollectible; therefore, that portion of the loan is written off, resulting in a reduction of the amortized cost basis and a corresponding adjustment to the ACL.
For the largest portfolio segments, including commercial and commercial real estate loans, expected credit losses are estimated using probability of default (“PD”) and loss given default (“LGD”) bottom-up approach, which derives the expected losses from borrower's and market or industry specific risk characteristics. For smaller-balance homogeneous loans with similar risk characteristics, including residential, consumer and small business loans, the models estimate lifetime loan losses based on the portfolio’s historical behavior. In order to incorporate forward-looking expectations, the ACL for these portfolios is adjusted based on macroeconomic factors proven to have effects on the performance of the credit quality of each respective portfolio. The models incorporate a probability-weighted blend of macroeconomic scenarios by ingesting numerous national, regional and metropolitan statistical area (“MSA”) level variables and data points. Some of the more impactful include both current and forecasted unemployment rates, home price index, CRE property forecasts, stock market and market volatility indices, real gross domestic product growth, and a variety of interest rates and spreads. The macroeconomic forecast process is complex and varies from period to period and therefore may results in increased volatility in the ACL and earnings. 
All loss estimates are conditioned as applicable on changes in current conditions and the reasonable and supportable economic forecast. Additionally, the Company makes qualitative adjustments to the ACL when, based on management’s judgment, there are factors impacting expected credit losses not taken into account by the quantitative calculations. Potential qualitative adjustments include economic factors, including material trends and developments that, in management's judgment, may not have been considered in the reasonable and supportable economic forecast, credit policy and staffing, including the nature and level of policy and procedural exceptions or changes in credit policy not reflected in quantitative results, changes in the quality of underwriting and portfolio management and staff and issues identified by credit review, internal audit or regulators that may not be reflected in quantitative results, concentrations, considering whether the quantitative estimate adequately accounts for concentration risk in the portfolio, model imprecision and model validation findings; and other factors not adequately considered in the quantitative estimate or other qualitative categories identified by management that may materially impact the amount of expected credit losses.
The Company expects to collect the amortized cost basis of government insured residential loans due to the nature of the government guarantee and, therefore generally have no expected credit losses.

Expected credit losses on loans to borrowers that are domiciled in foreign countries, primarily loans in the Consumer and Financial Institutions portfolios are generally estimated by assessing the any  available cash or other types of collateral, and the probability of losses arising from the Company’s exposure to those collateral assets. Loans in this portfolio are generally fully collateralized with cash, securities and other assets and, therefore, generally have no expected credit losses.
Commercial real estate, commercial and financial institution loans are charged off against the ACL when they are considered uncollectable. These loans are considered uncollectable when a loss becomes evident to management, which generally occurs when the following conditions are present, among others: (1) a loan or portions of a loan are classified as “loss” in accordance with the internal risk grading system; (2) a collection attorney has provided a written statement indicating that a loan or portions of a loan are considered uncollectible; and (3) the carrying value of a collateral-dependent loan exceeds the appraised value of the asset held as collateral. Consumer and other retail loans are charged off against the ACL at the earlier of (1) when management becomes aware that a loss has occurred, or (2) when closed-end retail loans become past due 90 days or open-end retail loans become past due 180 days from the contractual due date. For open and closed-end retail loans secured by residential real estate, any outstanding loan balance in excess of the fair value of the property, less cost to sell, is charged off no later than when the loan is 180 days past due from the contractual due date. Consumer and other retail loans may not be charged off when management can clearly document that a past due loan is well secured and in the process of collection such that collection will occur regardless of delinquency status in accordance with regulatory guidelines applicable to these types of loans. 
Recoveries on loans represent collections received on amounts that were previously charged off against the ACL. Recoveries are credited to the ACL when received, to the extent of the amount previously charged off against the ACL on the related loan. Any amounts collected in excess of this limit are first recognized as interest income, then as a reduction of collection costs, and then as other income.
Goodwill. 
Goodwill is evaluated for impairment at least annually and on an interim basis if an event or circumstance indicates that it is likely an impairment has occurred. We have applied significant judgment for annual goodwill impairment testing purposes. The Company recorded goodwill impairment of $1.3 million in 2023 as a result of this evaluation. Future negative changes may result in potential impairments in future periods. 
Determining the fair value of the reporting unit to which goodwill is allocated to (the Company as a whole since we report using a single-segment concept) is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant management judgment and the use of subjective measurements. Variability in the market and changes in assumptions or subjective measurements used to determine fair value are reasonably possible and may have a material impact on our financial position, liquidity or results of operations.
Deferred Income Taxes. 
We use the balance sheet method of accounting for income taxes as prescribed by GAAP. Under this method, DTAs and deferred tax liabilities, or DTLs, are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. If current available information raises doubt as to the realization of the DTAs a valuation allowance is established. DTAs and DTLs are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Accounting for deferred income taxes is a critical accounting estimate because we exercise significant judgment in evaluating the amount and timing of recognition of the resulting tax assets and liabilities. Management’s determination of the realization of DTAs is based upon management’s judgment of various future events and uncertainties, including the timing and amount of future income, reversing temporary differences which may offset, and the implementation of various tax plans to maximize realization of the DTAs. These judgments and estimates are inherently subjective and reviewed on a continual basis as regulatory and business factors change. Any reduction in estimated future taxable income may require us to record a valuation allowance against our DTAs. A DTA valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in such period, which would negatively affect earnings. Conversely, the reversal of a valuation allowance previously recorded against a DTA would result in lower tax expense.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements. 
We have evaluated new accounting pronouncements that have recently been issued and have determined that certain of these new accounting pronouncements should be described in this section because, upon their adoption, there could be a significant impact to our operations, financial condition or liquidity in future periods. In the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company adopted new accounting guidance on current expected credit losses, or CECL with retroactive application as of January 1, 2022, the beginning of the adoption period. Please refer to Note 1 of our audited consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K for a detailed discussion of CECL and other recently issued accounting pronouncements that have been adopted by us that will require enhanced disclosures in our financial statements in future periods.

Item 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
We believe interest rate and price risks are the most significant market risks impacting us. We monitor and evaluate these risks using sensitivity analyses to measure the effects of changes in market interest rates on earnings, equity and the available for sale portfolio mark-to-market exposure. Exposures are managed to a set of limits previously approved by our Board of Directors and monitored by management.
Our market risk is jointly monitored by the Treasury unit, which reports to our Chief Financial Officer, and the Market Risk and Analytics unit, which reports to our Chief Risk Officer.  Their  primary responsibilities are identifying, measuring, monitoring and controlling interest rate and liquidity risks and balance sheet asset/liability management, or ALM.  It also assesses and monitors the price risk of the Bank’s investment activities, which represents the risk to earnings and capital arising from changes in the fair market value of our investment portfolio.
Among its duties, the Treasury and Market Risk and Analytics units performs the following functions:
•
maintains a comprehensive market risk and ALM framework;
•
measures and monitors market risk and ALM across the organization to ensure that they are within approved risk limits and reports to ALCO and to the Board of Directors; and
•
recommends changes to risk limits to the Board of Directors.
We manage and implement our ALM strategies through monthly ALCO meetings. In the ALCO, we discuss, analyze, and decide on the best course of action to implement strategies designed as part of the ALM process.
Market risks taken by the Company are managed using an appropriate mix of marketable securities, wholesale funding and derivative contracts.
Market Risk Measurement
ALM
We use sensitivity analyses as the primary tool to monitor and evaluate market risk, which is comprised of interest rate risk and price risk.  Exposures are managed to a set of limits previously approved by our Board of Directors and monitored by ALCO.
Sensitivity analyses are based on changes in interest rates (both parallel yield curve changes as well as non-parallel), and are performed for several different metrics. They include three types of analyses consistent with industry practices:
•
earnings sensitivity;
•
economic value of equity, or EVE; and
•
investment portfolio mark-to-market exposure (debt and equity securities available for sale and held to maturity securities).
142
Table of Contents
 
The Company continues to be asset sensitive, therefore income is expected to increase when interest rates move higher, and to decrease when interest rates move lower.
The high duration of our balance sheet has led to more sensitivity in the market values of financial instruments (assets and liabilities, including off balance sheet exposures). This sensitivity is captured in the EVE and investment portfolio mark-to-market exposure analyses. In the earnings sensitivity analysis, the opposite occurs. The higher duration will produce higher income today and less income variability during the next 12 months.
We monitor these exposures, and contrast them against limits established by our Board of Directors. Those limits correspond to the capital levels and the capital leverage ratio that we would report taking into consideration the interest rate increase scenarios modeled. Although we model the market price risk of the available for sale securities portfolio, and its projected effects on AOCI or AOCL (a component of stockholders’ equity), the Bank and the Company made an irrevocable election in 2015 to exclude the effects of AOCI or AOCL in the calculation of its regulatory capital ratios, in connection with the adoption of Basel III Capital Rules in the U.S.
Earnings Sensitivity
In this method, the financial instruments (assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet positions) generate interest rate risk exposure from mismatches in maturity and/or repricing given the financial instruments’ characteristics or cash flow behaviors such as pre-payment speeds. This method measures the potential change in our net interest income over the next 12 months, which corresponds to our short term interest rate risk. This analysis subjects a static balance sheet to instantaneous and parallel interest rate shocks to the yield curves for the various interest rates and indices that affect our net interest income. We compare on a monthly basis the effect of the analysis on our net interest income over a one-year period against limits established by our Board of Directors.
The following table shows the sensitivity of our net interest income as a function of modeled interest rate changes:

(1)    Represents the change in net interest income, and the percentage that change represents of the base scenario net interest income.  The base scenario assumes (i) flat interest rates over the next 12 months, (ii) that total financial instrument balances are kept constant over time and (iii) that interest rate shocks are instant and parallel to the yield curve, for the various interest rates and indices that affect our net interest income.

Table of Contents
 
Net interest income in the base scenario, increased to approximately $361.0 million in December 31, 2024 compared to $336.0 million in December 31, 2023. This increase is mainly due to: (i) higher interest income of the investment portfolio as a result of the investment portfolio repositioning; (ii) the growth in the size of the balance sheet as total assets increased $185.4 million or 1.9%  in 2024 compared to 2023; and (iii) reduction of high cost interest-bearing deposits.
The Company periodically reviews the scenarios used for earnings sensitivity to reflect market conditions. 
Economic Value of Equity Analysis
We use economic value of equity, or EVE, to measure the potential change in the fair value of the Company’s asset and liability positions, and the subsequent potential effects on our economic capital. In the EVE analysis, we calculate the fair value of all assets and liabilities, including off-balance sheet instruments, based on different rate environments (i.e. fair value at current rates against the fair value based on parallel shifts of the yield curves for the various interest rates and indices that affect our net interest income). This analysis measures the long term interest rate risk of the balance sheet.
The following table shows the sensitivity of our EVE as a function of interest rate changes as of the periods presented:

The increase in sensitivity of EVE from changes in interest rates as of December 31, 2024 for the 200 and 100 basis point increase buckets are principally attributed to the changes in the composition of the  balance sheet becoming more asset sensitive compared to December 31, 2023. During the periods reported, the modeled effects on the EVE remained within established Company risk limits.

The average duration of our investment portfolio slightly increased to 5.2 years at December 31, 2024 compared to 5.0 years at December 31, 2023. The slight increase in duration was mainly due to lower mortgage-backed securities prepayments.
We monitor our interest rate exposures monthly through the ALCO, and seek to manage these exposures within limits established by our Board of Directors. Those limits correspond to the capital ratios that we would report taking into consideration the interest increase scenarios modeled. Notwithstanding that our model includes the available for sale securities portfolio, and its projected effect on AOCI or AOCL (a component of shareholders’ equity), we made an irrevocable election in 2015 to exclude the effects of AOCI or AOCL in the calculation of our regulatory capital ratios, in connection with the adoption of Basel III capital rules in the U.S

Limits Approval Process
The ALCO is responsible for the management of market risk exposures and meets monthly. The ALCO monitors all the Company’s exposures, compares them against specific limits, and takes actions to modify any exposure that the ALCO considers inappropriate based on market expectations or new business strategies, among other factors. The ALCO reviews and recommends market risk limits to our Board of Directors. These limits are reviewed annually or more frequently as believed appropriate, based on various factors, including capital levels and earnings.

Financial Statements Information
The financial statements information required by this item is contained under the section titled  “Index to Financial Statements” (and the financial statements and related notes referenced therein) included in Item 15.1 Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page F-1 of this Form 10-K.
Item 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE
None.
Item 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
The Company maintains a set of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. The CEO and the CFO, with assistance from other members of management, have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2024 and, based on their evaluation, have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of such date.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Other than the changes in 2024 in connection with the transition of our core data processing platform and other applications that was completed in the fourth quarter of 2023, there were no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act, that occurred during the period covered by this Form 10-K that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
On November 4, 2021, we announced a new multi-year outsourcing agreement with Fidelity National Information Services (FIS) which included the transition of our core data processing platform and other applications to FIS. This transition to FIS was completed on November 6, 2023. Upon completion of the transition, we updated our internal controls to include business cycle review controls, controls over data migration to the new core system, and controls over reliability of balances and transactional activity as of and in the post-conversion period ended December 31, 2023. In 2024, we continued to monitor the impact of this transition on our processes and procedures, as well as the impact on our internal controls over financial reporting and we further updated our internal controls, as necessary, to accommodate modifications to our business processes and accounting procedures.
Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) for the Company. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of the preparations 
147
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In designing and evaluating disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in SEC Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.
The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company’s assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention, or timely detection and correction of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Under the supervision and with the participation of Management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company has completed an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024.  In making the assessment, management used the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework 2013 promulgated by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“the COSO criteria”).  Based upon that assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2024, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective based upon the COSO criteria.
The Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, has been audited by RSM US LLP, the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their accompanying report which is included in Item 15.1 Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Amerant Bancorp Inc.
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Amerant Bancorp Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss), changes in stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements (collectively, the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework 
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013, and our report dated March 4, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

Allowance for Credit Losses – Loans Held for Investment
As described in Notes 1 and 5 to the financial statements, the Company’s allowance for credit losses for loans held for investment (allowance or allowance for credit losses) totaled $85 million as of December 31, 2024. The allowance for credit losses is an estimate of life-of-loan losses for the Company’s loans held for investment. The allowance is a valuation account that is deducted from the carrying amount of loans held for investment.
The allowance consists of two components: an asset-specific component for estimating credit losses for individual loans that do not share similar risk characteristics with other loans; and a pooled component for estimating credit losses for pools of loans that share similar risk characteristics. The allowance for the pooled component is derived from an estimate of expected credit losses primarily using an expected loss methodology that incorporates risk parameters such as probability of default (“PD”) and loss given default (“LGD”) which are derived from various vendor models and/or internally developed model estimation approaches for smaller homogenous loans.
The determination of the allowance involves a high degree of subjectivity from management and requires significant estimation of future economic scenarios, which management weights based on the Company’s economic outlook and relevant information about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. For commercial loans held for investment above $3 million, management estimates the LGD based on the Company’s own loss experience based on specific risk characteristics. Management estimates the LGD for commercial real estate loans based on vendor models using property and loan risk characteristics.
For smaller-balance homogeneous pooled loans with similar risk characteristics, management estimates the allowance based on models using observable inputs such as historical or average loss rates by year of loan origination (i.e., vintage) and prepayment considerations for future expected contractual loan outstanding balances. Management then adjusts the quantitative estimates of expected credit losses to incorporate considerations of current trends and conditions that are not captured in the quantitative credit loss estimates using qualitative or environmental factors.
The estimation of the allowance for pools of loans that share similar risk characteristics involves inputs and assumptions, many of which are derived from vendor and internally developed models. These inputs and assumptions include, among others, the selection, evaluation and measurement of the reasonable and supportable economic forecast scenarios, PD, LGD and prepayment rates. These specified inputs and assumptions require management to apply a significant amount of judgment and involves a high degree of estimation.
We identified the determination and evaluation of the PD, LGD and prepayment speed assumptions as a critical audit matter because auditing the underlying assumptions in the allowance model involves a high degree of complexity and auditor judgment given the high degree of subjectivity exercised by management in developing the allowance for credit losses in the loan portfolio held for investment.

Table of Contents
 
Our audit procedures related to management’s evaluation and establishment of the PD, LGD and prepayment speed assumptions of the allowance included the following, among others:
•
We obtained an understanding of the relevant controls related to the model and the evaluation and establishment of the PD, LGD and prepayment speed assumptions of the allowance and tested such controls for design and operating effectiveness.
•
We tested management’s process and significant judgments in the evaluation and establishment of the PD, LGD and prepayment speed assumptions of the allowance, which included:
–
Evaluating management’s considerations and data utilized as a basis for the PD, LGD and prepayment speed assumptions (e.g., loan to value, debt service coverage ratio, historical loss experience, selected borrowers’ financial information and prepayment considerations) and tested the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data that was used by management by tracing on a sample basis inputs into the model to source documentation.
–
Evaluated the reasonableness of management’s judgements and support around significant input assumptions used with current economic trends and conditions.
–
Evaluating the scope, sufficiency of procedures performed by the model validator and results driven from the process used by management in validating the model’s performance, including model output-outcome testing.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Amerant Bancorp Inc.
Opinion on the Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited Amerant Bancorp Inc. and its subsidiaries’ (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework 
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework 
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss), changes in stockholder’s equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements of the Company and our report dated March 4, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Business, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
a) Business
 Amerant Bancorp Inc  (the “Company”) is a Florida corporation incorporated in 1985, which has operated since January 1987. The Company is a bank holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (“BHC Act”), as a result of its 
100
% ownership of Amerant Bank, N.A. (the “Bank”).  The Company’s principal office is in the City of Coral Gables, FL. The Bank is a member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta (“Federal Reserve ”) and the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta (“FHLB”). The Bank is a national bank subject to regulation and regular examinations by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”). The Bank has 
two
 operating subsidiaries: Amerant Investments, Inc., a securities broker-dealer (“Amerant Investments”) and Amerant Mortgage, LLC (“Amerant Mortgage”), a mortgage lending company domiciled in Florida (“Amerant Mortgage”).
Elant Bank & Trust Ltd., a Grand-Cayman based trust company (the “Cayman Bank”) is a subsidiary of the Bank. The  Company is executing a plan for the dissolution of the Cayman Bank and, as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2024, the Cayman Bank no longer had any trust relationships, many of which were transferred to the Bank. The dissolution of the Cayman Bank is expected to be completed in 2025, once regulatory approval from the applicable regulatory agency is received.
The Bank has been serving the communities in which it operates for over 40 years. The Bank has 
19
 Banking Centers, including 
18
 located in South Florida, and 
one
 in Tampa, FL. As the main operating subsidiary of the Company, the Bank offers a wide variety of domestic, international, personal and commercial banking services. Investment, trust, fiduciary and wealth management services are provided through the Bank’s operating subsidiary Amerant Investments. Amerant Mortgage offers a full complement of residential lending solutions including conventional, government, construction, Jumbo loans, and other residential lending product offerings. The Company’s main activities are concentrated in its primary markets, with domestic customers located within those markets, and with international  customers mainly located in Latin America.  The Company does not have any significant concentrations to any one customer.
In May 2021, the Company incorporated a new wholly owned subsidiary, Amerant SPV, LLC, or Amerant SPV. From time to time, the Company may evaluate select opportunities to invest and acquire non-controlling interests, through Amerant SPV, in companies it partners with, or may acquire non-controlling interests of fintech and specialty finance companies that the Company believes will be strategic or accretive. In addition, through Amerant SPV, we may also invest in companies and funds that invest in technology companies that are developing solutions aimed at allowing financial institutions and community banks to more effectively compete and serve their customers.
The Company’s Class A common stock, par value $
0.10
 per common share (the “Common Stock”) was listed and traded on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) Global Select Market under the symbol “AMTB” until August 28, 2023. On August 3, 2023, the Company provided written notice to Nasdaq of its determination to voluntarily withdraw the principal listing of the Company’s Common Stock from Nasdaq and transfer the listing of the Common Stock to the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”). The Company’s Common Stock listing and trading on Nasdaq ended at market close on August 28, 2023, and trading commenced on the NYSE at market open on August 29, 2023 where it continues to trade under the stock symbol “AMTB”.

Public Offering and Securities Repositioning
On September 27, 2024, the Company completed a public offering of 
8,684,210
 shares of its Class A voting common stock, at a price to the public of $
19.00
 per share, which included 
784,210
 shares issued upon the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares of common stock (the “Public Offering”). The total gross proceeds from the offering were approximately $
165
 million, with net proceeds of approximately $
155.8
 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by the Company. The Company intends to use the net proceeds of the Public Offering for general corporate purposes and to support its continued organic growth, which may include, among other things, working capital, investments in the Bank, resolution of non-performing loans, and potential balance sheet optimization strategies.
Upon successfully completing the Public Offering, the Company initiated a repositioning of the Company’s securities portfolio (the “Securities Repositioning”). The Securities Repositioning consisted of the following actions: (i) transfer at their fair value (which was below their amortized cost) of all of the Company’s debt securities previously classified as held to maturity and carried at amortized cost to the available for sale category; (ii) sale of all corporate notes and subordinated debt; and (iii) sale of all other debt securities classified as available for sale (including those previously classified as held to maturity) with a book yield of less than 
2.75
%. As a result of the Securities Repositioning, the Company recorded a total pre-tax loss of approximately $
68.5
 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company completed the Securities Repositioning in October 2024, which resulted in an additional pre-tax loss on sale of approximately $
8.1
 million. 
See
 Note 3 - Securities for additional information on the Company’s securities portfolio.
Sale of Houston Banking Operations
On April 16, 2024, the Bank entered into a Purchase and Assumption Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with MidFirst Bank (“MidFirst”) pursuant to which MidFirst  purchased certain assets and assumed certain liabilities (the “Houston Sale Transaction”) of the banking operations and 
six
 branches in the Houston, Texas metropolitan statistical area (collectively, the “Branches”). Pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement, MidFirst  agreed to assume certain deposit liabilities and to acquire certain loans, as well as cash, real property, personal property and other fixed assets associated with the Branches, as well as 
45
 team members. On July 30, 2024, regulatory approval for the Houston Sale Transaction was received. The Houston Sale Transaction closed on November 8, 2024.
The purchase price for the purchased assets was computed as the sum of: (a) $
13.0
 million (the “Deposit Premium”), provided that, if the balance of non-interest checking deposits included in deposits or the total balance of deposits (excluding insured cash sweep deposits) decreased by more than 
15
% between March 13, 2024 and the closing date, then the Deposit Premium should  be equal to the sum of (i) 
9.50
% of the average daily balance of non-interest checking deposits included in deposits, (ii) 
1.85
% of the average daily balance of deposits other than non-interest checking deposits, insured cash sweep deposits and time deposits included in deposits, (iii) 
0.25
% of the average daily balance of insured cash sweep deposits included in Deposits, and (iv) 
0.50
% of the average daily balance of time deposits included in deposits, with the average daily balance in each case being for the 
30-day
 period ending on the fifth business day prior to closing, provided further, that the Deposit Premium should in no event be lower than $
9.25
 million, (b) the aggregate amount of cash on hand as of the closing date, (c) the aggregate net book value of all assets being assumed (excluding cash on hand, real property and accrued interest with respect to the loans to be acquired), (d) the appraised value of the real property to be acquired, and (e) accrued interest with respect to the loans to be acquired. The purchase price was subject to a customary post-closing adjustment based on 
F-14

 million as follows: (i) $
3.4

4.4
 million release in credit reserves after transferring the loans to held for sale. 
Restructuring Activities
In 2021, the Bank entered into a new multi-year outsourcing agreement with a recognized third party financial technology services provider (the “Financial Technology Services Agreement”). Under the terms of this agreement,  we transitioned our core data processing platform and other applications from previous software vendors to those offered by this third party financial technology service provider in the fourth quarter of 2023. This agreement is expected to allow the Bank to achieve greater operational efficiencies and deliver more advanced solutions and services to our customers. Effective January 1, 2022, there were 
80
 employees who are no longer working for the Company as a result of this new agreement. 
Contract termination Costs

no
 other restructuring costs in 2024.

30.0
 million offering of subordinated notes with a

Wholly-owned Subsidiaries Mergers
On August 2, 2022, the Company completed an intercompany transaction of entities under common control, pursuant to which the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, Amerant Florida Bancorp Inc. (“Amerant Florida”), merged with and into the Company, with the Company as sole survivor (the “Amerant Florida Merger”). In connection with the Amerant Florida Merger, the Company assumed all assets and liabilities of Amerant Florida, including its direct ownership of the Bank, the common capital securities issued by the 
five
 trust subsidiaries, and the junior subordinated debentures issued by Amerant Florida and related agreements. The Amerant Florida Merger had no impact to the Company’s consolidated financial condition and results of operations. 
See
 Note 11- Junior Subordinated Debentures Held By Trust Subsidiaries for additional information on the common capital securities issued by the five trust subsidiaries, and the junior subordinated debentures.
Changes in Ownership Interest in Amerant Mortgage
At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had an ownership interest of 
100
% in Amerant Mortgage, respectively. On December 31, 2023, Amerant Mortgage became a wholly-owned subsidiary of 
the Company as it increased its ownership interest to 
100
% effective as of December 31, 2023.
 This transaction had no material impact to the Company’s results of operations in the year ended December 31, 2023. In connection with the change in ownership interest, which brought the noncontrolling interest share of equity to zero, the Company derecognized the equity attributable to noncontrolling interest of $
3.8
 million at December 31, 2023, with a corresponding reduction to additional paid-in capital as of that date.
On March 31, 2022, the Company contributed $
1.5
 million in cash to Amerant Mortgage, increasing its ownership interest to 
57.4
% as of March 31, 2022 from 
51
% as of December 31, 2021. In addition, in the three months ended June 30, 2022, the Company increased its ownership interest in Amerant Mortgage to 
80
% from 
57.4
% at March 31, 2022. This change was the result of: (i) two former principals of Amerant Mortgage surrendering their interest in Amerant Mortgage to the Company, when they became full time employees of the Bank (the “Transfer of Subsidiary Shares From Noncontrolling Interest”), and (ii) an additional contribution made by the Company of $
1
 million, in cash, to Amerant Mortgage in the three months ended June 30, 2022. As a result of the Transfer of Subsidiary Shares From Noncontrolling Interest, in the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company reduced its Additional Paid-in Capital by a total of $
1.9
 million with a corresponding increase to the equity attributable to Noncontrolling Interest.

Business Acquisition
On January 13, 2023 (the “ 2023 Acquisition Date”), Amerant Mortgage completed the acquisition of certain assets and the assumption of certain liabilities of F&B Acquisition Group LLC (“F&B”), including access to an assembled workforce and other identifiable intangibles which collectively constituted a business (the “F&B Acquisition.”) The F&B Acquisition was recorded as a business acquisition using the acquisition method of accounting. The purchase price of approximately $
2.0
 million was paid in cash and included the fair value of certain loans held for sale of $
1.0
 million. Upon completion of the purchase price allocation in the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company determined there was no contingent consideration required to be included as part of purchase price. The Company recorded goodwill of $
1.0
 million, which represented the excess of the initial purchase price over the estimated fair value of tangible and intangible assets acquired, net of the liabilities assumed. 
Naming Rights
In September 2023, the Company acquired exclusive naming rights to an arena in Broward County, Florida. The naming rights have been recorded as an intangible asset with an offsetting liability for related payments to be made in the future. The naming rights intangible asset is included in other assets in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The naming rights liability is included as part of other liabilities in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.
Amerant SPV Investments
The Company, through Amerant SPV, has invested in equity and non-equity instruments issued by Marstone, Inc (“Marstone”), a digital wealth management fintech it has partnered with to provide digital wealth management and financial planning capabilities to new and existing customers. In connection with the equity investment, in November 2021, Gerald P. Plush, our Company’s Chairman, President & CEO, was appointed to Marstone’s Board of Directors as one of its seven individual members. In July 2023, the Company’s Chief Operating Officer replaced Mr. Plush in the role, and does not have individual  power to control or direct the operations of Marstone. The Company’s equity investment in Marstone represents less than 
5
% of its voting power. In addition, the Company considers it does not have a variable interest in Marstone. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company’s investments in Marstone include equity investments of $
2.6
 million and $
0.5
 million, respectively. At December 31, 2023, the Company had non-equity investments of $
1.6
 million. The Company had 
no
 non-equity investments in Marstone at December 31, 2024. In 2023, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $
2.0
 million related to its equity investments in Marstone.
In October 2021, the Company invested $
2.5
 million in an equity instrument issued by Raistone Financial Corp (“Raistone”), a financial technology solutions provider launched in 2017 that offers working capital financing solutions. This equity investment represents less than 
5
% of Raistone’s voting power. In addition, the Company considers it does not have a variable interest in Raistone. There were

 additional investments in Raistone in 2024, 2023 and 2022. 
In December 2021, the Company became a strategic lead investor in the JAM FINTOP Blockchain fund (the “JAM FINTOP Fund”), with an initial commitment of approximately $
5.4
 million that may be expanded to $
9.8
 million should the JAM FINTOP Fund increase to its maximum target size of $
200
 million. Initially, the JAM FINTOP Fund will focus its investments on the blockchain “infrastructure layer” that will help regulated financial institutions compliantly operate blockchain-powered applications in areas such as lending, payments, and exchanges. As a strategic lead investor in the JAM FINTOP Fund, the Company expects to have access and become an early adopter of this transformational technology. At December 31, 2024 and 2023 the investment in the JAM FINTOP Fund amounted to $
2.6
 million and $
1.4
 million, respectively.

In May 2023, the Company became an investor in the Black Dragon Fund (“Black Dragon”). At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the investment in Black Dragon amounted to $
1.0
 million.
These investments in Marstone, Raistone, Black Dragon and the JAM FINTOP Fund are recorded at their original cost and are included in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet in other assets. The Company reviews these investments periodically for deterioration. At December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, other than the impairment charge discussed above in connection with the Company's investments in Marstone, the Company considers these investments are not deteriorated and did not record an impairment charge as a result.
Bank Owned Life Insurance
 In the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company completed a restructuring of its bank-owned life insurance (“BOLI”) program. This was executed through a combination of a 1035 exchange and a surrender and reinvestment into a higher-yielding general account with a new investment grade insurance carrier. This transaction allowed for higher team member participation through an enhanced split-dollar plan. Estimated improved yields resulting from the enhancement have an earn-back period of approximately 
2
 years. In the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company recorded total additional expenses and charges of $
4.6
 million in connection with this transaction, including: (i) a reduction of $
0.7
 million to the cash surrender value of BOLI; (ii) transaction costs of $
1.1
 million, included as part of other operating expenses, and (iii) income tax expense of $
2.8
 million. In addition, as of December 31, 2023, the Company had  a receivable from the prior insurance carrier for $
62.5
 million in connection with the restructuring of the Company’s BOLI in the fourth quarter of 2023, which was included as part of other assets in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. The Company collected in full this receivable from the prior insurance carrier in February 2024.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
On June 8, 2022, the shareholders of the Company approved the Amerant Bancorp Inc. 2021 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP” or the “Plan”). The purpose of the Plan is to provide eligible employees of the Company and its designated subsidiaries with the opportunity to acquire a stock ownership interest in the Company on favorable terms and to pay for such acquisitions through payroll deductions. All named executive officers, and all other executive officers of the Company who were eligible as of the enrollment deadline for the first offering period elected to participate in the Plan. 
See
 Note 14-Incentive Compensation and Benefit Plans for more details on the ESPP.

b) Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Significant Accounting Policies
The following is a description of the significant accounting policies and practices followed by the Company in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. These policies conform with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). 
Segment Reporting 
The Company is managed using a single segment concept, on a consolidated basis, as 
one
 reportable business segment. See Note 25- Segment Reporting for more information.
Principles of Consolidation 
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company evaluates whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity in the form of a variable-interest entity, or a voting interest entity.
 
Non-Controlling Interest
Prior to December 31, 2023, the Company records net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests in its consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss) equal to the percentage of the economic or ownership interest retained in the interest of Amerant Mortgage and presents non-controlling interests as a component of stockholders’ equity on the consolidated balance sheets and separately as net loss attributable to non-controlling interests on the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss). Effective as of December 31, 2023, Amerant Mortgage became a wholly-owned subsidiary and, as result, the Company recorded no noncontrolling interest in its consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the year ended December 31, 2024. In the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded noncontrolling interests in its consolidated statement of operations equal to the percentages of the economic or ownership interest retained during those periods. In connection with the change in ownership interest as of December 31, 2023, which brought the minority interest share to zero at that date, the Company derecognized the equity attributable to noncontrolling interest of $
3.8
 million at December 31, 2023, with a corresponding reduction to additional paid-in capital.

Estimates 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates made by management include: (i) the determination of the allowance for credit losses; (ii) the fair values of loans, securities and derivative contracts; (iii) the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance;  (iv) the determination of whether the amount of deferred tax assets will more likely than not be realized; and (v) the determination of estimated contract termination costs. Management believes that these estimates are appropriate. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
In 2023 and 2022, noninterest expenses include $
1.6
 million and $
7.1
 million, respectively, of estimated contract termination costs associated with third party vendors resulting from the Company’s transition to our new technology provider. Contract termination costs represent estimated expenses to terminate contracts before the end of their terms, and are recognized when the Company terminates a contract in accordance with its terms, generally considered the time when the Company gives written notice to the counterparty within the notification period contractually established, or when the Company determines that it no longer derives economic benefits from the contracts. Contract termination costs also include expenses associated with the abandonment of existing capitalized projects which are no longer expected to be completed as a result of a contract termination. Changes to initial estimated expenses to terminate contracts resulting from revisions to timing or the amount of estimated cash flows are recognized in the period of the changes. There were 
no
 contract termination costs in the year ended December 31, 2024.
 
Earnings per Share 
Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during each period. Unvested shares of restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance stock units outstanding during the period  are excluded from the basic earnings per share computation.
 Diluted net income per common share reflects the number of additional common stock that would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential common stock had been issued. Dilutive potential common stock consist of unvested shares of restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance stock units outstanding during the period. The dilutive effect of potential common stock is calculated by applying the treasury stock method. The latter assumes dilutive potential common stock are issued and outstanding and the proceeds from the exercise, are used to purchase common stock at the average market price during the period. The difference between the numbers of dilutive potential common stock issued and the number of shares purchased is included as incremental shares in the denominator to compute diluted net income per common stock. Dilutive potential common stock are excluded from the diluted earnings per share computation in the period in which the effect is anti-dilutive, such as when there are net losses from operations.
Changes in the number of shares outstanding as a result of stock dividends, stock splits, stock exchanges or reverse stock splits are given effect retroactively for all periods presented to reflect those changes in capital structure.
 
Income Recognition 
Interest income is generally recognized on the accrual basis using the interest method. Non-refundable loan origination fees, net of direct costs of originating or acquiring loans, as well as loan purchase premiums and discounts, are deferred and amortized over the term of the related loans as adjustments to interest income using the level yield method. Purchase premiums and discounts on debt securities are amortized as adjustments to interest income over the estimated lives of the securities using the level yield method.

Brokerage and advisory activities include brokerage commissions and advisory fees. Brokerage commissions earned are related to the dollar amount of trading volume of customers’ transactions. Commissions and related clearing expenses are recorded on a trade-date basis as securities transactions occur. The Company believes that the performance obligation is satisfied on the trade date because that is when the underlying financial instrument has been transferred to/from the customer. Advisory fees are derived from investment advisory fees and account administrative services. Investment advisory fees are recorded as earned on a pro rata basis over the term of the contracts, based on a percentage of the average value of assets managed during the period. The Company believes the performance obligation for providing advisory services is satisfied over time because the customer is receiving and consuming benefits as they are provided by the Company. These fees are assessed and collected at least quarterly. Account administrative fees are charged to customers for the maintenance of their accounts and are earned and collected on a quarterly basis. Fiduciary activities fee income is recognized as earned on a pro rata basis over the term of contracts. 
Card servicing fees include credit and debit card interchange fees and other fees. Interchange fees are recognized when earned. Trade finance servicing fees, which primarily include commissions on letters of credit, are generally recognized over the service period on a straight line basis. 
Deposits and services fees include service charges on deposit accounts, fees for banking services provided to customers including wire transfers, overdrafts and non-sufficient funds. Revenue from these sources is generally recognized in accordance with published deposit account agreements for customer accounts or when fixed and determinable per contractual agreements.
Loan-level derivative income is generated from back-to-back derivative transactions with commercial loan clients and with brokers. The Company earns a fee upon inception of the back-to-back derivative transactions, corresponding to the spread between a wholesale rate and a retail rate.
Stock-based Compensation
The Company may grant share-based compensation and other related awards to its non-employee directors, officers, employees and certain consultants. Compensation cost is measured based on the estimated fair value of the award at the grant date and recognized in earnings as an increase in additional paid in capital on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period or vesting period  for each separately vesting portion of each award when awards have graded vesting features. The fair value of the unvested shares of restricted stock and restricted stock units is based on the market price of the Company’s Class A common stock at the date of the grant. The fair value of performance stock units at the grant date is based on estimated fair values using an option pricing model. 
The Company maintains an ESPP. The ESPP allows eligible employees to purchase common stock at a 
15
% discount applied to the stock price at the beginning or end of the offering period, whichever is lower. Each offering period is six months in length with a purchase limit of 
5,000
 shares per eligible employee per offering period and a $
25,000
 per eligible employee contribution limit per year. Each offering period will begin the first trading day on or after June 1 and December 1 of each year. The fair value of the ESPP at the beginning of the offering period is based on an estimated fair value using an option pricing model. The Company recognizes compensation expense in an amount equal to the estimated fair value of the 
15
% discount plus the fair value of the look-back option, over the offering period.
 
Advertising Expenses
Advertising expenses are expensed as incurred, and includes amortization of naming rights intangible, except for media production costs which are expensed upon the first airing of the advertisement, and are included in other noninterest expenses.

Voluntary and Involuntary Early Retirement Plan Expenses and other Staff Reduction Costs
The Company accounts for voluntary and involuntary early retirement plan expenses and other staff reduction costs by establishing a liability for costs associated with the exit or disposal activity, including severance and other related costs, when the liability is incurred, rather than when we commit to an exit plan.
In 2023 and 2022, salaries and employment benefits include $
4.0
 million and  $
3.0
 million, respectively, of severance expenses mainly in connection with the Company’s restructuring activities. In 2024, there was 
no
 significant severance expense in connection with these activities. 
Offering Expenses
Specific, non-reimbursable, incremental costs directly attributable to a proposed or actual securities offerings are deferred and charged against the gross proceeds of the offering.
 
Loan-level derivative expenses
Loan-level derivative expenses are incurred in back-to-back derivative transactions with commercial loan clients and with brokers. The Company pays a fee upon inception of the back-to-back derivative transactions, corresponding to the spread between a wholesale rate and a retail rate.
Cash and Cash Equivalents 
The Company has defined as cash equivalents those highly liquid instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less and include cash and cash due from banks, federal funds sold and deposits with banks and other short-term investments.
The Company must comply with federal regulations requiring the maintenance of minimum reserve balances against its deposits. Effective March 26, 2020, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System reduced reserve requirements ratios to zero percent. Therefore, there were 
no
 minimum reserve balances required at December 31, 2024 and 2023. 
The Company maintains some of its cash deposited with third-party depository institutions for amounts that, at times, may be in excess of federally-insured limits mandated by the FDIC.

Securities 
The Company classifies its investments in securities as debt securities available for sale, debt securities held to maturity and equity securities with readily determinable fair value not held for trading. Securities classified as debt securities available for sale are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) or accumulated other comprehensive loss (“AOCL”) in stockholders’ equity on an after-tax basis. Equity securities with readily determinable fair value not held for trading primarily consists of mutual funds carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings. Securities classified as debt securities held to maturity are securities the Company has both the ability and intent to hold until maturity and are carried at amortized cost. Investments in stock issued by the Federal Reserve and Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta (“FHLB”) are stated at their original cost, which approximates their realizable value. Realized gains and losses from sales of securities are recorded on the trade date and are determined using the specific identification method. Securities purchased or sold are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as of the trade date. Receivables and payables to and from clearing organizations relating to outstanding transactions are included in other assets or other liabilities. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, securities receivables included in other assets amounted to $
0.9
 million and $
0.8
 million, respectively. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, securities payable related to purchases pending settlement and included in other liabilities amounted to $
0.3
 million.
For debt securities available for sale, the Company evaluates whether: (i) the fair value of the securities is less than the amortized costs basis; (ii) it intends to sell, or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell, the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, and (iii) the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses or other factors. The Company estimates credit losses on debt securities available for sale using a discounted cash flow model. The present value of an impaired debt security results from estimating future cash flows that are expected to be collected, discounted at the debt security’s effective interest rate. The Company develops its estimates about cash flows expected to be collected and determines whether a credit loss exists, generally using information about past events, current conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts and other qualitative factors including the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost basis, adverse conditions specifically related to the security, industry or geographic area, changes in conditions of any collateral underlying the securities, changes in credit ratings, failure of the issuer to make scheduled payments, among other qualitative factors specific to the applicable security. If a credit loss exists, the Company records an allowance for the credit losses, limited to the amount by which the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. The Company recognizes in AOCI/AOCL any decline in the fair value below amortized cost on debt securities available for sale that has not been recorded through an allowance for credit losses.
Loans Held for Sale, at Lower of Cost or Fair Value
Loans originated for investment are transferred into the held for sale classification at the lower of carrying amount or fair value, when they are specifically identified for sale and a formal plan exists to sell them. When the Company determines that a formal plan to sell loans in this category no longer exists, the Company reclassifies these loans to loans held for investment at their carrying value at the date of the transfer, with the loans’ carrying value becoming their new basis. Any resulting difference between the loans unpaid principal amount and their carrying value is amortized through earning for the remainder lives of the loans.

Mortgage Loans Held for Sale, at Fair Value
Mortgage loans originated for sale are carried at fair value under the fair value option, with changes in fair value recognized in current period earnings presented in other income. The fair value is measured on an individual loan basis using quoted market prices and when not available, comparable market value or discounted cash flow analysis may be utilized. Gains and losses on loan sales are recognized in other noninterest income in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive (loss) income.
 
Loans Held for Investment
Loans represent extensions of credit which the Company has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff. These extensions of credit consist of commercial real estate loans, or CRE loans, (including land acquisition, development and construction loans), owner occupied real estate loans, single-family residential loans, commercial loans, loans to financial institutions and acceptances, and consumer loans. Amounts included in the loan portfolio are stated at the loans unamortized costs reduced by an allowance for credit losses if any. The unamortized cost of a loan consists of its unpaid principal balance, unamortized premiums, discounts and deferred loan origination fees and costs, net of amounts previously charged off. Unamortized premiums, discounts and deferred loan origination costs, including premiums or discounts paid on loan purchases, amounted to $
0.9
 million and $
11.2
 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
A loan is placed in nonaccrual status when management believes that collection in full of the principal amount of the loan or related interest is in doubt. Management considers that collectability is in doubt when any of the following factors are present, among others: (1) there is a reasonable probability of inability to collect principal, interest or both, on a loan for which payments are current or delinquent for less than ninety days; or (2) when a required payment of principal, interest or both, is delinquent for ninety days or longer, unless the loan is considered well secured and in the process of collection in accordance with regulatory guidelines. Once a loan to a single borrower has been placed in nonaccrual status, management reviews all loans to the same borrower to determine their appropriate accrual status. When a loan is placed in nonaccrual status, accrual of interest and amortization of net deferred loan fees or costs are discontinued, and any accrued interest receivable is reversed against interest income. 
Payments received on a loan in nonaccrual status are generally applied to its outstanding principal amount, unless there are no doubts on the full collection of the remaining recorded investment in the loan. When there are no doubts on the full collection of the remaining recorded investment in the loan, and there is sufficient documentation to support the collectability of that amount, payments of interest received may be recorded as interest income. 
A loan in nonaccrual status is returned to accrual status when none of the conditions noted when first placed in nonaccrual status are currently present, none of its principal and interest is past due, and management believes there are reasonable prospects of the loan performing in accordance with its terms. For this purpose, management generally considers there are reasonable prospects of performance in accordance with the loan terms when at least six months of principal and interest payments or principal curtailments have been received, and current financial information of the borrower demonstrates that the borrower has the capacity to continue to perform into the near future. 
The total outstanding principal amount of a loan is reported as past due thirty days following the date of a missed scheduled payment, based on the contractual terms of the loan. 
The Company modifies loans related to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties by providing multiple types of concessions. Typically, one type of concession, such as a term extension, is granted initially. If the borrower continues to experience financial difficulty, another concession, such as principal forgiveness, may be granted.

Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL)
The ACL is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of financial assets carried at their amortized cost, including loans held for investment and debt securities held to maturity, to present the net amount that is expected to be collected throughout the life of the financial asset. The estimated ACL is recorded through a provision for credit losses charged against operations. Management periodically evaluates the adequacy of the ACL to maintain it at a level it believes to be reasonable. The Company uses the same methods used to determine the ACL to assess any reserves needed for off-balance sheet credit risks such as unfunded loan commitments and contingent obligations on letters of credit. These reserves for off-balance sheet credit risks are presented in the liabilities section in the consolidated balance sheets.
The ACL consists of two components: an asset-specific component for estimating credit losses for individual loans that do not share similar risk characteristics with other loans; and a pooled component for estimating credit losses for pools of loans that share similar risk characteristics. The ACL for the pooled component is derived from an estimate of expected credit losses primarily using an expected loss methodology that incorporates risk parameters such as probability of default (“PD”) and loss given default (“LGD”) which are derived from various vendor models and/or internally developed model estimation approaches for smaller homogenous loans. 
PD is projected in these models or estimation approaches using economic scenarios, whose outcomes are weighted based on the Company’s economic outlook and are developed to incorporate relevant information about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. For commercial loans above $3 million, LGD is typically derived from the Company’s own loss experience based on specific risk characteristics.
 
For  commercial real estate loans, the LGD is derived from vendor models using property and loan risk characteristics. The estimation of the ACL for pools of loans that share similar risk characteristics involves inputs and assumptions, many of which are derived from vendor and internally-developed models. These inputs and assumptions include, among others, the selection, evaluation and measurement of the reasonable and supportable forecast scenarios, PD and LGD which requires management to apply a significant amount of judgment and involves a high degree of estimation uncertainty. The ACL estimation process applies an economic forecast scenario or a composite of scenarios based on management's judgment and expectations around the current and future macroeconomic outlook. Expected credit losses are estimated over the contractual term of the loans, adjusted for expected prepayments when appropriate. The contractual term of a loan excludes expected extensions, renewals, and modification under certain conditions.
For smaller-balance homogeneous pooled loans with similar risk characteristics such as collateral type and loan purpose (e.g., residential, small business lending under $3 million, consumer and land loans), other modeling techniques are used.
 
These include modeling that relies upon observable inputs such as historical or average loss rates by year of loan origination (i.e.,vintage) and prepayment considerations for future expected contractual loan outstanding balances.
For the smaller-balance homogenous pooled loan segments, the quantitative estimates of expected credit losses are then adjusted to incorporate considerations of current trends and conditions that are not captured in the quantitative credit loss estimates through the use of qualitative or environmental factors. The measurement of expected credit losses on these loan segments is influenced by macro-economic conditions.

Expected credit losses on loans to borrowers that are domiciled in foreign countries, primarily loans in the Consumer and Financial Institutions portfolios are generally estimated by assessing available cash or other types of collateral, and the probability of losses arising from the Company’s exposure to those collateral assets. Loans in these portfolio are generally fully collateralized with cash, securities and other assets and, therefore, generally have no expected credit losses.
Commercial real estate, commercial and financial institution loans are charged off against the ACL when they are considered uncollectible. These loans are considered uncollectible when a loss becomes evident to management, which generally occurs when the following conditions are present, among others: (1) a loan or portions of a loan are classified as “loss” in accordance with the internal risk and credit monitoring grading system; (2) a collection attorney has provided a written statement indicating that a loan or portions of a loan are considered uncollectible; and (3) when loans are evaluated individually and the carrying value of a collateral-dependent loan exceeds the appraised value of the asset held as collateral. Consumer and other retail loans are charged off against the ACL at the earlier of (1) when management becomes aware that a loss has occurred, or (2) when closed-end retail loans become past due 90 days (120 days previously) or open-end retail loans become past due 180 days from the contractual due date. For open and closed-end retail loans secured by residential real estate, any outstanding loan balance in excess of the fair value of the property, less cost to sell, is charged off no later than when the loan is 180 days past due from the contractual due date. Consumer and other retail loans may not be charged off when management can clearly document that a past due loan is well secured and in the process of collection such that collection will occur regardless of delinquency status in accordance with regulatory guidelines applicable to these types of loans. 
The Company modifies loans related to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties by providing multiple types of concessions. When the Company modifies loans by providing principal forgiveness, the amount of the principal forgiveness is deemed to be uncollectible and, therefore, that portion of the loan is written off resulting in a reduction of the amortized cost basis and a corresponding adjustment to the ACL.
Recoveries on loans represent collections received on amounts that were previously charged off against the ACL. Recoveries are credited to the ACL when received, to the extent of the amount previously charged off against the ACL on the related loan. Any amounts collected in excess of this limit are first recognized as interest income, then as a reduction of collection costs, and then as other income.
 
Accrued Interest Receivable
The Company has elected to present accrued interest receivable related to loans, debt securities available for sale and held to maturity as part of other assets in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. Therefore, accrued interest receivable is excluded from the amortized cost basis of loans, debt securities available for sale and held to maturity. The Company generally does not estimate an ACL on accrued interest receivable balances since uncollectible accrued interest is timely written off in accordance with the Company's accounting policies for non-accrual loans. Accrued interest receivable on nonaccrual loans is written off by reversing interest income.
 
Transfers of Financial Assets 
Transfers of financial assets are accounted for as sales or purchases when control over the assets has been surrendered by the transferor. Control over transferred assets is deemed to be surrendered when the assets have been isolated from the transferor, the transferee obtains the right (free of conditions that constrain it from taking advantage of that right) to pledge or exchange the transferred assets, and the transferor does not maintain effective control over the transferred assets.

Debt Modifications
Debt modifications or restructures are accounted for as modifications if the terms of the new debt and original instrument are not considered substantially different. The debt is not considered substantially different when the present value of cash flows under the terms of the new debt instrument are less than 10% different from the present value of remaining cash flows under the terms of the original instrument. If the new debt is considered substantially different, the original debt is derecognized and the new debt is recorded at fair value, with any prepayment penalty being amortized over the life of the new borrowing. If the new debt is considered substantially different, the original debt is derecognized with any prepayment penalty recorded as a loss on debt extinguishment  as a component of noninterest income.
 
Premises and Equipment, Net 
Premises and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is computed on the straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets.  Repairs and maintenance are charged to operations as incurred; renewals, betterments and interest during construction are capitalized. Gains or losses on sales of premises and equipment are recorded as noninterest income at the date of sale.
The Company leases various premises for bank branches under operating leases. The leases have varying terms, with most containing renewal options and annual increases in base rents. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the remaining term of the lease.
Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. For purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss, when the independent and identifiable cash flow of a single asset may not be determinable, the long-lived asset may be grouped with other assets of like cash flows. Recoverability of an asset or group of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount with future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or group of assets. If an asset is considered impaired, the impairment recognized is generally measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or group exceeds its fair value.
 
Leases
The Company determines whether a contract is or contains a lease at inception. For leases with terms greater than twelve months under which the Company is lessee, right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recorded at the commencement date. Lease liabilities are initially recorded based on the present value of future lease payments over the lease term. Right-of-use assets are initially recorded at the amount of the associated lease liabilities plus prepaid lease payments and initial direct costs, less any lease incentives received. The cost of short term leases is recognized on a straight line basis over the lease term. The lease term includes options to extend if the exercise of those options is reasonably certain and includes termination options if there is reasonable certainty the options will not be exercised.  The Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the appropriate term and information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments, unless an implicit rate is defined in the contract or is determinable, which is generally not the case.  Leases are classified as financing or operating leases at commencement; generally, leases are classified as finance leases when effective control of the underlying asset is transferred. All the leases under which the Company is lessee are classified as operating leases. For operating leases, lease cost is recognized in earnings on a straight line basis over the lease terms. Variable lease costs are recognized in the period in which the obligation for those costs is incurred. Sublease income is recognized as a reduction to lease cost over a straight line basis over the lease terms. 
The Company provides equipment financing through a variety of loan and lease structures, including direct or sale type finance leases and operating leases. Direct or sale type finance leases are carried at the aggregate of lease payments receivable and estimated residual value of the leased property, if applicable, less unearned income. Interest income is recognized over the term of the direct or sale type finance leases to achieve a constant periodic rate of return on the outstanding investment. Operating leases are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Rental income in connection with operating leases are included as part of other noninterest income in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss).

Mortgage Servicing Rights 
The Company recognizes as an asset the rights to service mortgage loans (“MSRs”), either when the mortgage loans are sold to third parties and the associated servicing rights are retained or when servicing rights are obtained from acquisitions. These MSRs are initially recorded at fair value. The Company has elected to subsequently measure all MSRs at fair value. MSRs are reported on the consolidated balance sheets in the “Other assets” section, with changes to the fair value recorded as other noninterest income in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive (loss) income. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, MSRs totaled $
1.5
 million and $
1.4
 million, respectively.
Bank Owned Life Insurance 
BOLI policies are recorded at the cash surrender value of the insurance contracts, which represent the amount that may be realizable under the contracts, at the consolidated balance sheet dates. Changes to the cash surrender value are recorded as other noninterest income in the consolidated statements of operations.
 
Other Real Estate Owned and Repossessed Assets
The Company, from time to time, receives other real estate property, or OREO, and non-real estate repossessed assets, in full or partial satisfaction of its loans. OREO and non-real estate repossessed assets are recorded at the fair value of the asset less the estimated cost to sell, and the loan amount reduced for the remaining balance of the loan. The amount by which the cost basis in the loan exceeds the fair value (net of estimated cost to sell) of the asset is charged to the ACL. Upon transfer to OREO and repossessed assets, the fair value less cost to sell becomes the new cost basis for the asset. Subsequent declines in the fair value of the assets below the new cost basis are recorded through the use of a valuation allowance. The fair value of OREO is generally based upon recent appraisal values of the property, less cost to sell. The fair value of non-real estate repossessed assets is generally provided by third parties based on their assumptions and quoted market prices for similar assets, when available. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had OREO totaling $
18.1
 million and $
20.2
 million, respectively, and is reported on the consolidated balance sheet in other assets. In 2023, the Company repossessed and sold non-real estate assets with a carrying value of $
6.4
 million and realized a loss on sale of approximately $
2.6
 million.
 
Income Taxes 
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined using the balance sheet method. Under this method, the resulting net deferred tax asset is determined based on the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. The effect of changes in tax laws or rates is recognized in results in the period that includes the legislation enactment date. A valuation allowance is established against the deferred tax asset to the extent that management believes that it is more likely than not that any tax benefit will not be realized. Income tax expense is recognized on the periodic change in deferred tax assets and liabilities at the current statutory rates. 
The results of operations of the Company and the majority of its wholly owned subsidiaries are included in the consolidated federal income tax return of the Company and its subsidiaries as members of the same consolidated tax group. 
Under the intercompany income tax allocation policy, the Company and the subsidiaries included in the consolidated federal tax group are allocated current and deferred taxes as if they were separate taxpayers. As a result, the subsidiaries included in the consolidated group pay their allocation of income taxes to the Company, or receive payments from the Company to the extent that tax benefits are realized.

Goodwill 
Goodwill primarily represents the excess of consideration paid over the fair value of the net assets acquired in transactions recorded as business combinations. Goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed for potential impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis in the fourth quarter, or on an interim basis if events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment. As part of its testing, the Company may elect to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount which includes goodwill (“Step 0”). If the results of Step 0 indicate that more likely than not the reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount, the Company determines the fair value of the reporting unit relative to its carrying amount, including goodwill (“Step 1”). The Company may also elect to bypass Step 0 and begin with Step 1. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired. However, if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, then an impairment loss exists and is recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill.
 At December 31, 2024, goodwill was  considered not impaired and, therefore, 
no
 impairment charges were recorded in 2024. In 2023, the Company determined that goodwill related to its subsidiaries Amerant Mortgage and the Cayman Bank was impaired and, therefore, recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $
1.3
 million in 2023. 
 
Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase 
Securities sold under agreements to repurchase are classified as secured borrowings and are reflected at the amount of cash received in connection with the transaction.
 
Derivative Instruments 
Derivative instruments are recognized on the consolidated balance sheets as other assets or other liabilities, at their respective fair values. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument is dependent upon whether the derivative has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship. For derivative instruments that have not been designated and qualified as hedging relationships, the change in their fair value is recognized in current period earnings. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instruments is initially recognized as a component of AOCI or AOCL, and subsequently reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the hedged transactions affect earnings. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss, if any, is recognized immediately in earnings. The Company has designated certain derivatives as cash flow hedges. Management periodically evaluates the effectiveness of these hedges in offsetting the fluctuations in cash flows due to changes in benchmark interest rates. 
The Company also enters into interest rate swaps to provide commercial loan clients the ability to swap from a variable interest rate to a fixed rate. The Company enters into a floating-rate loan with a customer with a separately issued swap agreement allowing the customer to convert floating payments of the loan into a fixed interest rate. To mitigate risk, the Company will generally enter into a matching agreement with a third party to offset the exposure on the customer agreement. These swaps are not considered to be qualified hedging relationships and therefore, all unrealized gain or loss is recorded as part of other noninterest income.
The Company enters into certain contracts involving the risk of dealing with financial institutional derivative counterparties to manage the credit risk exposure on certain interest rate swaps with customers. These contracts are carried at fair value and recorded in the consolidated balance sheet within other assets or other liabilities.

Fair Value Measurement 
Financial instruments are classified based on a three-level valuation hierarchy required by GAAP. The valuation hierarchy is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date. The three levels are defined as follows: 
Level 1
Inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 1 assets and liabilities may include debt and equity securities that are traded in an active exchange market, as well as certain U.S. securities that are highly liquid and are actively traded in over-the-counter markets. 
Level 2
Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets and liabilities. Level 2 assets and liabilities include debt securities with quoted prices that are traded less frequently than exchange traded instruments which value is determined by using a pricing model with inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data. This category generally may include U.S. government and U.S. Government Sponsored Enterprise mortgage backed debt securities and corporate debt securities.
Level 3
Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets and liabilities may include financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation. 
A financial instrument’s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
 
Reclassifications
 In 2024 and 2023, OREO and repossessed assets, net expense is presented separately in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss). OREO and repossessed assets expense includes expenses and revenue (rental income) from the operation of foreclosed property/assets as well as fair value adjustments and gains/losses from the sale of OREO and repossessed assets. In 2022, while OREO valuation expense was presented separately, all other OREO-related expenses were presented as part of other operating expenses in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss).

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
Issued and Adopted
Guidance on Accounting for Credit Losses on Financial Instruments
In 2022, the Company adopted ASC Topic 326 on CECL.  The Company adopted the CECL guidance as of the beginning of the reporting period of adoption, January 1, 2022, using a modified retrospective approach for all its financial assets measured at amortized cost and off-balance sheet credit exposures. 
The following table reflects the impact of adopting CECL on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets:

Upon CECL adoption, the Company did not record a change to the allowance for credit losses for off-balance sheet credit exposures, and the Company did not record an allowance for credit losses for debt securities available for sale and held to maturity. 
See
 Note 3-Securities for more details on the determination of expected credit losses on debt securities available for sale and held to maturity. 
 
Guidance on Troubled Debt Restructurings
In March 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued guidance that eliminates the recognition and measurement guidance on troubled debt restructurings, or TDR, for creditors, and aligns it with existing guidance to determine whether a loan modification results in a new loan or a continuation of an existing loan. The
 
guidance also requires enhanced disclosures about certain loan modifications by creditors when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. The amended guidance is effective in periods beginning after December 15, 2022 using either a prospective or modified retrospective transition approach. Early adoption was permitted if an entity had already adopted the guidance on accounting for credit losses on financial instruments (“CECL”). The Company adopted this
 
guidance on TDR as of January 1, 2023, and determined that its adoption had no material impact to the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
Guidance on Fair Value Hedges
In March 2022, the FASB issued amended guidance to expand and clarify existing guidance on fair value hedge accounting of interest rate risk for portfolios of financial assets. The amendments clarify, among others, the “last-of-layer” method for making the fair value hedge accounting for these portfolios more accessible. The amendment also improves the last-of-layer concepts and expands them to non-prepayable financial assets, allowing more flexibility in the structure of derivatives used to hedge interest rate risk. The amended guidance is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, and interim periods within those fiscal years. For all other entities, the amended guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023. The amended guidance is available for early adoption. The Company adopted this guidance as of January 1, 2023, and determined that its adoption had no impact to its consolidated financial statements.

Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting
On March 12, 2020, the FASB issued amendments to guidance applicable to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. These amendments provide optional guidance for a limited period of time to ease the potential burden in accounting for (or recognizing the effects of) reference rate reform on financial reporting. The expedients and exceptions provided by the amendments do not apply to contract modifications made and hedging relationships entered into or evaluated after December 31, 2022, except for hedging relationships existing as of December 31, 2022, that an entity has elected certain optional expedients for and that are retained through the end of the hedging relationship. The amendments also allow entities to make a one-time election to sell, transfer, or both sell and transfer debt securities classified as held to maturity that reference a rate affected by reference rate reform and that are classified as held to maturity before January 1, 2020.  In December 2022, the FASB issued new guidance to extend the sunset date of this guidance from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2024, after which entities will no longer be permitted to apply the relief under this guidance. Prior to this new guidance, these amendments were effective for all entities as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022.
 During 2021, the Company completed its assessment of all third-party-provided products, services, and systems that would be affected by any changes to references to LIBOR, including changes to all relevant systems. Beginning in January 2022, the Company started referencing new loans and other products, including loan-level derivatives to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”). In 2023, the Company  completed the migration of all variable rate loans, derivative contracts and other financial instruments from LIBOR to SOFR.
New Guidance for Segment Reporting
In November 2023, the FASB issued new guidance to improve disclosure requirements for reportable segments, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. In addition, the amendments require entities to provide all annual disclosures about a reportable segment’s profit or loss and assets currently required under FASB ASC Topic 280 in interim periods. Also, this guidance clarifies circumstances in which an entity can disclose multiple segment measures of profit or loss and provides new segment disclosure requirements for entities with a single reportable segment. For public business entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company adopted this guidance as of December 31, 2024 which resulted in additional disclosures about the Company operating as a single segment; there were  no other impacts to the Company's consolidated financial statements upon adoption of this new guidance as of December 31, 2024. See Note 25- Segment Information for more details.
Issued and Not Yet Adopted
New Guidance on Income Taxes
In December 2023, the FASB issued amended guidance that requires entities to provide additional income tax disclosures for annual and interim periods. This includes the disclosure of more detailed information on income tax reconciliations and income tax paid. In addition, the amendments
 remove certain existing disclosure requirements related to uncertain tax positions and unrecognized deferred tax liabilities. 
 For public business entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal 
years beginning after December 15, 2024, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2025. 
 The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements when adopted.

New Guidance for Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions
On June 30, 2022, the FASB issued new guidance to improve fair value guidance for equity securities subject to contractual sale restrictions. These amendments clarify that a contractual restriction on the sale of an equity security is not considered part of the unit of account of the equity security and, therefore, is not considered in measuring fair value. The amendments also clarify that an entity cannot, as a separate unit of account, recognize and measure a contractual sale restriction. The amendments also require additional disclosures for equity securities subject to contractual sale restrictions. For public business entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements when adopted.

Upon successfully completing the Public Offering, the Company initiated the Securities Repositioning aimed at improving yields, increasing liquidity and de-risking the securities portfolio. As part of this strategy, in the third quarter of 2024, the Company: (i) transferred at their fair value (which was below their amortized cost basis) all of the debt securities previously classified as held to maturity and carried at amortized cost to the debt securities available for sale category; (ii) sold all of the Company’s investments in subordinated debt securities, included in corporate bonds, which resulted in a pre-tax loss on sale of approximately $
6.7
 million in the third quarter of 2024; and (iii) decided to sell all other corporate bonds. In addition, as a result of its decision to sell all debt securities available for sale (including those previously classified as held to maturity) which had accumulated unrealized losses and met the criteria for inclusion in the Securities Repositioning, the Company recorded a pre-tax impairment loss totaling approximately $
61.8
 million on debt securities available for sale, and resulted in a write down of their previous amortized cost to their estimated fair value as of September 30, 2024. The Company completed the Securities Repositioning in October 2024, which resulted in an additional pre-tax loss on sale of approximately $
8.1
 million as a result of the subsequent decline in fair market value of the securities.
There were 
no
 debt securities available for sale held by the Company considered delinquent on contractual payments as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, nor were there any securities placed on non-accrual status during the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.

U.S. Government Sponsored Enterprise Debt Securities and U.S. Government Agency Debt Securities
At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company held certain debt securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government and U.S. government-sponsored entities and agencies. The Company does not intend to sell these debt securities and it is more likely than not that it will not be required to sell the securities before their anticipated recovery. The Company evaluates these securities for credit losses by reviewing current market conditions, the extent and nature of changes in fair value, credit ratings, default and delinquency rates and current analysts’ evaluations. The Company believes the decline in fair value on these debt securities is attributable to changes in interest rates and securities markets, generally, and not credit quality. As a result, the Company did 
no
t record an ACL on these securities as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.
Corporate Bonds
 At December 31, 2022, the Bank had 
one
 corporate debt security held for sale (the “Signature Bond”) issued by Signature Bank, N.A. (“Signature”), with a fair value of $
9.1
 million and unrealized loss of $
0.9
 million. At December 31, 2022, the Signature Bond was in an unrealized loss position for less than one year. On March 12, 2023, Signature was closed by the New York State Department of Financial Services, which appointed the FDIC as receiver. The FDIC, as receiver, announced that shareholders and certain unsecured debt holders will not be protected. On March 27, 2023, the Bank sold the Signature Bond in an open market transaction and realized a pretax loss on sale of approximately $
9.5
 million which is recorded in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
In May 2023, the Company sold a portion of its investment in a corporate bond held for sale issued by a financial institution, to reduce single point exposure. The Company had proceeds of $
0.8
 million and realized a pre-tax loss of $
1.2
 million in connection with this transaction. This loss was recorded in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2023.  
At December 31, 2023, the Company had no intent to sell its investments in corporate bonds available for sale and it was more likely than not that it would not be required to sell these investments before their anticipated recovery. The Company evaluates corporate bonds for credit losses, when required, by reviewing various qualitative and quantitative factors such as current market conditions, the extent and nature of changes in fair value, credit ratings, default and delinquency rates, and current analysts’ evaluations. The Company believes the decline in fair value on these debt securities had been attributable to changes in interest rates and investment securities markets, generally, and not credit quality. As a result, the Company did 
no
t record an ACL on these securities as of December 31, 2023. The Company had 
no
 corporate bonds available for sale at December 31, 2024.
Debt securities held to maturity
As a result of the Securities Repositioning, the Company did 
no
t have debt securities held to maturity as December 31, 2024.

 The Company evaluates all debt securities held to maturity quarterly to determine if any securities in an unrealized loss position require an ACL. The Company considers that all debt securities held to maturity issued or sponsored by the U.S. government are considered to be risk-free as they have the backing of the government. The Company did 
no
t have debt securities held to maturity as of December 31, 2024. As of December 31, 2023, the Company believed there were no current expected credit losses on these securities and, therefore, did not record an ACL on any of its debt securities held to maturity as of that date. The Company monitors the credit quality of held to maturity securities through the use of credit ratings. Credit ratings are monitored by the Company on at least a quarterly basis. As of  December 31, 2023, all debt securities held to maturity held by the Company were rated investment grade or higher.

Real estate loans include commercial loans secured by real estate properties. Commercial loans secured by non-owner occupied real estate properties are generally granted to finance the acquisition or operation of commercial real estate properties, with terms similar to the properties’ useful lives or the operating cycle of the businesses. The main source of repayment of these real estate loans is derived from cash flows or conversion of productive assets and not from the income generated by the disposition of the property held as collateral. The main repayment source of loans granted to finance land acquisition, development and construction projects is generally derived from the disposition of the properties held as collateral, with the repayment capacity of the borrowers and any guarantors considered as alternative sources of repayment.  Commercial loans secured by owner-occupied real estate properties are generally granted to finance the acquisition or operation of commercial real estate properties, with terms similar to the properties’ useful lives or the operating cycle of the businesses. The main source of repayment of these commercial real estate loans is derived from cash flows and not from the income generated by the disposition of the property held as collateral. 
Commercial loans correspond to facilities established for specific business purposes such as financing working capital and capital improvements projects and asset-based lending, among others. These may be loan commitments, uncommitted lines of credit to qualifying customers, short term (one year or less) or longer term credit facilities, and may be secured, unsecured or partially secured. Terms on commercial loans generally do not exceed five years, and exceptions are documented. The Company provides equipment financing using a variety of loan and lease structures, as part of its commercial lending activities. These equipment loans and leases are originated under a white-label equipment financing solution launched in the second quarter of 2022.
Commercial loans to borrowers in similar businesses or products with similar characteristics or specific credit requirements are generally evaluated under a standardized commercial credit program. Commercial loans outside the scope of those programs are evaluated on a case by case basis, with consideration of any exposure under an existing commercial credit program.

Loans to financial institutions and acceptances are granted mainly to non-depository financial institutions such as mortgage companies and other financial intermediaries. In addition, it includes a cash collateral loan to a depository institution. Loans in this portfolio segment are generally granted for terms not exceeding 
three years
 and on a secured basis under the terms of each credit agreement. Prior to approval, management also considers portfolio limits set forth in its programs and credit policies. 
Single-family residential and consumer and other loans are retail open-end and closed-end credits extended to individuals and businesses secured by single-family residences in the U.S for business, household, family and other personal expenditures. Single-family and consumer loans include loans to individuals and businesses secured by personal residence, including first mortgage, home equity and home improvement loans as well as revolving credit card agreements. In addition, consumer and other loans, include purchased indirect lending loans we have purchased from time to time from third parties. Because these loans generally consist of a large number of relatively small-balance, homogeneous loans for each type, their risks are generally evaluated collectively. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company purchased $
41.5
 million and $
26.5
 million, respectively, in single-family residential loans. There were 
no
 purchases of indirect consumer loans in 2024 or 2023.
At December 31, 2024 and 2023, loans with an outstanding principal balance of $
2.0
 billion and $
2.5
 billion, respectively, were pledged as collateral to secure advances from the FHLB. 
The amounts in the table above include loans held for investment under syndication facilities for approximately $
393.7
 million and $
271.8
 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which include Shared National Credit facilities, or SNCs, and agreements to enter into credit agreements among other lenders (club deals), and other agreements. These loans are primarily designed for providing working capital to certain qualified domestic and international commercial entities meeting our credit quality criteria and concentration limits, and approved in accordance with credit policies.  In addition, consumer loans and overdrafts in the table above include indirect consumer loans purchased totaling $
82.9
 million and $
210.9
 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
International loans included above were $
40.7
 million  and $
87.6
 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, mainly single-family residential loans. These loans are generally fully collateralized with cash, cash equivalents or other financial instruments.

In 2024, the Company transferred an aggregate of $
497.3
 million in loans held from investment to the loans held for sale category, in connection with the Houston Sale Transaction.  The Company recorded a valuation allowance of $
1.3
 million as a result of the transfer in the same period. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the Houston Sale Transaction closed and as result, the Company sold, at par, all loans held for sale carried at the lower of cost or fair value at the time of sale. The carrying value of the loans at the time of sale was approximately $
473.9
 million. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company decided to sell and sold business-purpose, investment property, residential mortgage loans with carrying value of $
71.1
 million . We recorded a loss on sale of $
12.6
 million including estimated transaction costs.
In the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company transferred an aggregate of $
401
 million in Houston-based CRE loans held for investment to the loans held for sale category, and recognized a valuation allowance of $
35.5
 million as a result of the fair value adjustment of these loans. In January 2024, the Company completed the sale of these loans for approximately $
365.2
 million. There was no material impact to the Company’s results of operations in 2024 as result of this transaction.
In 2023, the Company transferred one New York-based CRE loan held for investment to the loans held for sale category, and recognized a valuation allowance of $
5.6
 million as result of the fair value adjustment of this loan. Also in 2023, the Company sold this loan at the lower of fair value or cost of approximately $
43.3
 million, and recognized a loss on sale of $
2.0
 million in connection with this transaction. In 2022, the Company completed the sale of approximately $
57.3
 million in loans held for sale carried at the lower of fair value or cost related to the New York portfolio, at their par value.
c) Concentration of risk
While seeking diversification of our loan portfolio held for investment and held for sale, the Company is dependent mostly on the economic conditions that affect South and Central Florida, Tampa, and the greater Houston and New York City areas, especially the five New York City boroughs. At December 31, 2024, our commercial real estate loans held for investment based in South Florida, Tampa and Central Florida, New York, Houston and other regions were $
1.8
 billion, $
189.2
 million, $
221.8
 million, $
191.0
 million and $
121.1
 million, respectively.

Diversification is managed through policies with limitations for exposure to individual or related debtors and for country risk exposure. 
d) Accrued interest receivable on loans
Accrued interest receivable on total loans, including loans held for investment and held for sale, was $
40.4
 million and $
44.2
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. In 2024 and 2023, the Company reversed approximately $
2.1
 million and $
0.9
 million, respectively, of accrued interest receivable against interest income in connection with real estate and commercial loans placed in non-accrual status during the period.  In 2022, the Company reversed accrued interest receivable on loans placed in non-accrual status during the year against interest income of approximately $
0.9
 million related to consumer loans and overdrafts and a total of $
0.1
 million related to real estate loans and commercial loans.

______________
(1) The Company adopted CECL effective as of January 1, 2022. See Note 1 to our audited annual consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K for details on the adoption of CECL.
The ACL decreased by $
10.5
 million, or 
11.0
% at December 31, 2024, compared to December 31, 2023. The ACL as a percentage of total loans held for investment was 
1.18
% at December 31, 2024 compared to 
1.39
%  at December 31, 2023.  The provision for credit losses on loans in 2024 was offset by net charge-offs. 
The 
$
57.6
 million
 provision for credit losses on loans includes
 $
41.1
 million to cover charge-offs, $
16.7
 million in new specific reserves for non-performing loans and $
8.1
 million due to loan composition and volume changes. These provision requirements were partially offset by a release of $
3.9
 million due to credit quality and macroeconomic factor updates and a $
4.4
 million release due to the Houston loan portfolio classification as held-for-sale.

Loan Modifications to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty
The Company modifies loans related to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties by providing multiple types of concessions. Typically, one type of concession, such as a term extension, is granted initially. If the borrower continues to experience financial difficulty, another concession, such as principal forgiveness, may be granted. 
The following table shows information about a new loan modification to a borrower experiencing financial difficultly in the year ended December 31, 2024.

Credit Risk Quality
The sufficiency of the ACL is reviewed at least quarterly by the Chief Risk Officer and the Chief Financial Officer. The Board of Directors considers the ACL as part of its review of the Company’s consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company believes the ACL to be sufficient to absorb expected credit losses in the loans portfolio in accordance with GAAP.
Loans may be classified but not considered collateral dependent due to one of the following reasons: (1) the Company has established minimum dollar amount thresholds for individual assessment of expected credit losses, which results in loans under those thresholds being excluded from individual assessment of expected credit losses; and (2) classified loans may be considered in the assessment because the Company expects to collect all amounts due.
As part of the on-going monitoring of the credit quality of the Company’s loan portfolio, management tracks certain credit quality indicators including trends related primarily to (i) the risk rating of loans, (ii) the loan payment status, (iii) net charge-offs, (iv) nonperforming loans and (v) the general economic conditions in the main geographies where the Company’s borrowers conduct their businesses. The Company considers the views of its regulators as to loan classification and in the process of estimating expected credit losses. 
The Company utilizes an internal risk rating system to identify the risk characteristics of each of its loans, or group of homogeneous loans such as consumer loans. Internal risk ratings are updated on a continuous basis on a scale from 1 (worst credit quality) to 10 (best credit quality). Loans are then grouped in five master risk categories for purposes of monitoring rising levels of potential loss risks and to enable the activation of collection or recovery processes as defined in the Company’s Credit Risk Policy. 
Internal risk ratings are considered the most meaningful indicator of credit quality for commercial loans. 
Generally, internal risk ratings for commercial real estate loans and commercial loans with balances over $
3
 million are updated at least annually and more frequently if circumstances indicate that a change in risk rating may be warranted. For consumer loans, single-family residential loans and smaller commercial loans under $
3
 million, risk ratings are updated based on the loans past due status. 
The following is a summary of the master risk categories and their associated loan risk ratings, as well as a description of the general characteristics of the master risk category:

onclassified 
This category includes loans considered as Pass (5-10) and Special Mention (4). A loan classified as Pass is considered of sufficient quality to preclude a lower adverse rating. These loans are generally well protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the borrower or by the value of any collateral received. Special Mention loans are defined as having potential weaknesses that deserve management’s close attention which, if left uncorrected, could potentially result in further credit deterioration. Special Mention loans may include loans originated with certain credit weaknesses or that developed those weaknesses since their origination.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022
Classified 
This classification indicates the presence of credit weaknesses which could make loan repayment unlikely, such as partial or total late payments and other contractual defaults. 
Substandard 
A loan classified substandard is inadequately protected by the sound worth and paying capacity of the borrower or the collateral pledged. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if the credit weaknesses are not corrected. Loss potential, while existing in the aggregate amount of substandard loans, does not have to exist in individual assets. 
Doubtful 
These loans have all the weaknesses inherent in a loan classified as substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. These are poor quality loans in which neither the collateral, if any, nor the financial condition of the borrower presently ensure collection in full in a reasonable period of time. As a result, the possibility of loss is extremely high.
 
Loss 
Loans classified as loss are considered uncollectible and of such little value that the continuance as bankable assets is not warranted. This classification does not mean that the assets have absolutely no recovery or salvage value, but not to the point where a write-off should be deferred even though partial recoveries may occur in the future. This classification is based upon current facts, not probabilities. As a result, loans in this category should be promptly charged off in the period in which they are determined to be uncollectible.

In February 2025, the Company decided to sell a $
40.8
 million substandard owner-occupied loan to a customer in the restaurant service sector in Florida. The Company transferred the loan from loans held for investment to loans held for sale, at the lower of cost or fair value, and determined no valuation allowance was required at the time of the transfer.

Credit Risk Quality Indicators - Consumer Loan Classes
The credit risk quality of the Company’s residential real estate and consumer loan portfolios is evaluated by considering the repayment performance of individual borrowers, and then classified on an aggregate or pool basis. Loan secured by real estate in these classes which have been past due 90 days or more, and 120 days or 180 days or more, are classified as Substandard and Loss, respectively. Unsecured consumer loans which become past due 90 days are charged- off. When the Company has documented that past due loans in these classes are well-secured and in the process of collection, then the loans may remain in accrual status. Loan-To-Value and FICO scores are also an important indicator of credit quality for single-family residential loans and consumer loans. When loans are classified, loan-to-value is updated at least annually. FICO scores are typically at origination, except for a significant portion of indirect consumer loans which are updated at least quarterly.

Collateral dependent loans are evaluated on an individual basis for purposes for determining expected credit losses. For collateral-dependent loans where the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and the Company expects repayment of the financial asset to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral, the ACL is measured based on the difference between the fair value of the collateral and the amortized cost basis of the loan as of the measurement date. When repayment is expected to be from the operation of the collateral, expected credit losses are calculated as the amount by which the amortized cost basis of the loan exceeds the present value of expected cash flows from the operation of the collateral. When repayment is expected to be from the sale of the collateral, expected credit losses are calculated as the amount by which the amortized cost basis of the loan exceeds the fair value of the underlying collateral less estimated costs to sell. The ACL may be zero if the fair value of the collateral at the measurement date exceeds the amortized cost basis of the loan. None of the collateral-dependent commercial real estate and owner occupied loans at December 31, 2024 were deemed collateral dependent loans as of December 31, 2023.

On June 23, 2020, the Company completed a $
60.0
 million offering of senior notes with a coupon rate of 
5.75
% and a maturity date of June 30, 2025 (the “Senior Notes”). The net proceeds, after direct issuance costs of $
1.6

59.5
 million, respectively, net of direct unamortized issuance costs of 
$
0.2
 million
 and $
0.5
 million, respectively
. The Senior Notes are presented net of direct issuance costs in the consolidated financial statements. These costs have been deferred and are being amortized over the term of the Senior Notes of 
5
 years as an adjustment to yield. These Senior Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated, rank equally with all of our existing and future unsecured, and unsubordinated indebtedness.
In February 2025, the Company elected to redeem and satisfy in full the Senior Notes at a redemption price of 
100
% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest on April 1, 2025.

Subordinated Notes
On March 9, 2022, the Company entered into a Subordinated Note Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Amerant Florida (the “Guarantor”), and qualified institutional buyers pursuant to which the Company sold and issued $
30.0
 million aggregate principal amount of its 
4.25
% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due March 15, 2032 (the “Subordinated Notes”).  Net proceeds were $
29.1
 million, after estimated direct issuance costs of approximately $
0.9
 million. Unamortized direct issuance costs are deferred and amortized over the term of the Subordinated Notes of 
10
 years. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, these Subordinated Notes amounted to $
29.6
 million and $
29.5
 million, respectively, net of direct unamortized issuance costs of $
0.4
 million and $
0.5
 million, respectively.
The Subordinated Notes will initially bear interest at a fixed rate of 
4.25
% per annum, from and including March 9, 2022, to but excluding March 15, 2027, with interest payable semi-annually in arrears. From and including March 15, 2027, to but excluding the stated maturity date or early redemption date, the interest rate will reset quarterly to an annual floating rate equal to the then-current benchmark rate, which will initially be the three-month SOFR plus 
251
 basis points, with interest during such period payable quarterly in arrears. If the three-month SOFR cannot be determined during the applicable floating rate period, a different index will be determined and used in accordance with the terms of the Subordinated Notes.
These Subordinated Notes are unsecured, subordinated obligations of the Company and rank junior in right of payment to all of the Company’s current and future senior indebtedness. Prior to March 15, 2027, the Company may redeem the Subordinated Notes, in whole but not in part, only under certain limited circumstances. On or after March 15, 2027, the Company may, at its option, redeem the Subordinated Notes, in whole or in part, on any interest payment date, subject to the receipt of any required regulatory approvals. The Subordinated Notes have been structured to qualify as Tier 2 capital of the Company for regulatory capital purposes, and rank equally in right of payment to all of our existing and future subordinated indebtedness. 
The Subordinated Notes were offered and sold by the Company in a private placement offering in reliance on exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and Rule 506(b) of Regulation D under the Securities Act. In connection with the sale and issuance of the Subordinated Notes, the Company entered into a registration rights agreement, pursuant to which the Company agreed to take certain actions to provide for the exchange of the Subordinated Notes for subordinated notes that are registered under the Securities Act and will have substantially the same terms. 
On June 21, 2022, the Company successfully completed the exchange of all of its outstanding Subordinated Notes for an equal principal amount of its registered 
4.25
% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due 2032 (the “Registered Subordinated Notes”). The terms of the Registered Subordinated Notes are substantially identical to the terms of the Subordinated Notes, except that the Registered Subordinated Notes are not subject to the transfer restrictions, registration rights and additional interest provisions (under the circumstances described in the registration rights agreement relating to our fulfillment of our registration obligations) applicable to the Subordinated Notes.
On August 2, 2022, the Company completed an intercompany transaction of entities under common control, pursuant to which the Guarantor, merged with and into the Company, with the Company as sole survivor .

Junior Subordinated Debentures Held by Trust Subsidiaries 
At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company owns all of the common capital securities issued by 
five
 statutory trust subsidiaries (the “Trust Subsidiaries”), respectively. These Trust Subsidiaries were first formed by the Company for the purpose of issuing trust preferred securities (the “Trust Preferred Securities”) and investing the proceeds in junior subordinated debentures issued by the Company (the “Debentures”). The Debentures are guaranteed by the Company. The Company records the common capital securities issued by the Trust Subsidiaries in other assets in its consolidated balance sheets using the equity method. The Debentures issued to the Trust Subsidiaries, less the common securities of the Trust Subsidiaries, qualify as Tier 1 regulatory capital. 
The following tables provide information on the outstanding Trust Preferred Securities issued by, and the Debentures issued to, each of the Trust Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2024 and 2023:

The Company and the Trust Subsidiaries have the option to defer payment of interest on the obligations for up to 10 semi-annual periods. In 2024 and 2023, 
no
 payments of interest have been deferred on these obligations. The Trust Preferred Securities are subject to mandatory redemption, in whole or in part, upon the maturity or early redemption of the debentures. Early redemption premiums may be payable. 
LIBOR Cessation and Replacement Rate
 
 In 2023, the Trust Preferred Securities and the Debentures issued by the Company included calculations that were based on 3-month LIBOR. On March 15, 2022, the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act (the ‘LIBOR Act”) was signed into law. Under the LIBOR Act, on the first London banking day after June 30, 2023 (the “LIBOR Replacement Date”), a benchmark replacement recommended by the Federal Reserve replaced LIBOR in certain contracts, including those that contain no fallback provisions and other related aspects. The Federal Reserve issued its final regulations under the LIBOR Act. The final regulations: (i) address the applicability of the LIBOR Act to various LIBOR contracts, which include the Trust Preferred Securities and the Debentures, (ii) identify the benchmark replacements, (iii) include certain benchmark replacement conforming changes, (iv) address the issue of preemption and (v) provide other clarifications, definitions and information.

December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022
Based on a review of the Trust Preferred Securities and the Debentures documents, these documents do not provide a replacement rate for 3-month LIBOR or include other fallback provisions which would apply on the LIBOR Replacement Date. Based on the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority’s current statements, it does not appear that a synthetic LIBOR benchmark will be applicable to the Trust Preferred Securities and Debentures. Accordingly, absent an amendment to the Trust Preferred Securities and Debenture documents, some other change in applicable law, rule, regulation, or some other development, on and after the LIBOR Replacement Date, 3-month CME term SOFR or 6-month CME Term SOFR (as defined in the regulations) as adjusted by the relevant spread adjustment of 
0.26161
%, shall be the benchmark replacement for 3-month LIBOR in the Trust Preferred Securities and Debentures documents, and all applicable benchmark replacement conforming changes as specified in the regulations will become an integral part of the Trust Preferred Securities and Debenture documents, without any action by any party. The Company did not seek to amend the Trust Preferred Securities and Debentures documents to reflect any other LIBOR benchmark replacement.

Derivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments
       Interest Rate Swaps On Debt Instruments
The Company enters into interest rate swap contracts on debt instruments which the Company designates and qualifies as cash flow hedges. These interest rate swaps are designed as cash flow hedges to manage the exposure that arises from differences in the amount of the Company’s known or expected cash receipts and the known or expected cash payments on designated debt instruments. These interest rate swap contracts involve the Company’s payment of fixed-rate amounts in exchange for the Company receiving variable-rate payments over the life of the contracts without exchange of the underlying notional amount.
At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had 
five
 interest rate swap contracts with notional amounts totaling $
64.2
 million, maturing in the third and fourth quarters of 2025. These contracts were designated as cash flow hedges to manage the exposure of variable rate interest payments on all of the Company’s outstanding variable-rate junior subordinated debentures with principal amounts at December 31, 2024 and 2023 totaling $
64.2
 million. The Company expects these interest rate swaps to be highly effective in offsetting the effects of changes in interest rates on cash flows associated with the Company’s variable-rate junior subordinated debentures. In 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized unrealized gains  of $
0.8
 million and $
0.6
 million, respectively, in connection with these interest rate swap contracts, which were included as part of  interest expense on junior subordinated debentures in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss). As of December 31, 2024, the estimated net unrealized gains in accumulated other comprehensive expected to be reclassified into expense in the next twelve months amounted to $
0.2
 million.
In 2019, the Company terminated 
16
 interest rate swaps that had been designated as cash flow hedges of variable rate interest payments on the outstanding and expected rollover of variable-rate advances from the FHLB. The Company is recognizing the contracts’ cumulative net unrealized gains of $
8.9
 million in earnings over the remaining original life of the terminated interest rate swaps ranging between 
one month
 and 
seven years
. In 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized approximately $
1.0
 million and $
1.3
 million, respectively, as a reduction of interest expense on FHLB advances as a result of this amortization. As of December 31, 2024, the remaining cumulative net unrealized gains related to these interest rate swaps was $
1.3
 million.

Interest Rate Swaps On Loans
In the second quarter of 2023, the Company entered into an interest rate swap contract with a notional amount of $
50.0
 million, and maturity in the second quarter of 2025. The Company designated this interest rate swap as a cash flow hedge to manage interest rate risk exposure on variable rate interest receipts on the first $
50
 million principal balance of a pool of loans. This interest rate swap contract involves the Company’s payment of variable-rate amounts in exchange for the Company receiving fixed-rate payments over the life of the contract without exchange of the underlying notional amount. In 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized unrealized losses of $
0.7
 million and $
0.4
 million, respectively, related to this interest rate swap contract. These unrealized losses  were included as part of interest income on loans in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive (loss) income. As of December 31, 2024, the estimated net unrealized losses in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income expected to be reclassified into interest income in the next twelve months amounted to $
0.1
 million.
Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments
  a) Customer related positions
The Company offers certain derivatives products, including interest rate swaps and caps, directly to qualified commercial banking customers to facilitate their risk management strategies. The Company partially offsets its exposure to interest rate swaps and caps by entering similar derivative contracts with various third-party brokers. 
Interest Rate Swaps
Interest rate swap contracts involve the Company’s payment of variable-rate amounts to customers in exchange for the Company receiving fixed-rate payments from customers over the life of the contracts without exchange of the underlying notional amount. These instruments have maturities ranging from less than 
1
 to 
12
 years in 2024 (
1
 to 
13
 years in 2023).
 The Company enters into swap participation agreements with other financial institutions to manage the credit risk exposure on certain interest rate swaps with customers. Under these agreements, the Company, as the beneficiary or guarantor, will receive or make payments from/to the counterparty if the borrower defaults on the related interest rate swap contract. The notional amount of these agreements is based on the Company’s pro-rata share of the related interest rate swap contracts.
Interest Rate Caps
Interest rate cap contracts involve the Company making payments if an interest rate exceeds the agreed strike price. These instruments have maturities ranging from less than 
1
 to 
10
 years in 2024 (less than 
1
 to 
11
 years in 2023). 
In April 2022, the Company entered into 
4
 interest rate cap contracts with various third-party brokers with total notional amounts of $
140.0
 million. These interest rate caps initially served to partially offset changes in the estimated fair value of interest rate cap contracts with customers. At December 31, 2023, there was 
one
 interest rate cap contract, respectively, with total notional amount of $
35.0
 million in connection with this transaction. At December 31, 2024, there were 
no
 interest rate cap contracts in connection with this transaction.

b) Mortgage Derivatives
 The Company enters into interest rate lock commitments and forward sale contracts to manage the risk exposure in the mortgage banking area. Interest rate lock commitments guarantee the funding of residential mortgage loans originated for sale, at specified interest rates and times in the future. Mortgage loan forward sale contracts consist of commitments to deliver mortgage loans, originated and/or purchased, in the secondary market at a future date. A separate type of forward sale contracts are the commitment to sell To-Be-Announced (“TBA”) mortgage-backed securities on a specific future date.  In 2024 and 2023, the change in the fair value of these instruments was an unrealized gain and loss of $
43
 thousand and $
0.4
 million, respectively. These amounts were recorded as part of other noninterest income in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.
Credit Risk-Related Contingent Features
 Some agreements may require the Company to pledge securities as collateral when the valuation of the interest rate swap derivative contracts fall below a certain amount. There were $
0.4
 million in securities pledged as collateral for interest rate swaps in a liability position at December 31, 2024. At December 31, 2023, there were 
no
 securities pledged as collateral for interest rate swaps in a liability position. Additionally, most of our derivative arrangements with counterparties require the posting of collateral upon meeting certain net exposure threshold. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had cash held as collateral for derivatives margin calls of $
23.5
 million and $
25.0
 million, respectively. 
See
 Note 2 “Interest Earning Deposits with Banks, Other Short-Term Investments and Restricted Cash” for additional information about cash held as collateral.  As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, there were 
no
 collateral requirements related to interest rate swaps with third-party brokers not designated as hedging instruments.

Leases
The Company leases certain premises and equipment under operating leases. The operating leases have remaining lease terms ranging from

Certain operating leases contain variable lease payments which include mostly common area maintenance and taxes, included in occupancy and equipment on the consolidated statements of income. The Company had $
2.1
 million, $

The purpose of the ESPP is to provide eligible employees of the Company and its designated subsidiaries with the opportunity to acquire a stock ownership interest in the Company on favorable terms and to pay for such acquisitions through payroll deductions.  The number of shares of Class A common stock issued in 2024, 2023 and 2022 under the ESPP was 
55,407
, 
56,927
 and 
35,337

0.3
 million, $
0.5
 million, $
0.3
 million respectively, in connection with the ESPP. 
c) Employee Benefit Plan 
The Amerant Bank, N.A. Retirement Benefits Plan (the “401(k) Plan”) is a 401(k) defined contribution employee benefit plan covering substantially all employees of the Company. 
The Company matches 
100
% of each participant’s contribution up to a maximum of 
5
% of their annual salary. Contributions by the Company to the Plan are based upon a fixed percentage of participants’ salaries as defined by the Plan. The Plan enables Highly Compensated employees to contribute up to the maximum allowed without further restrictions. All contributions made by the Company to the participants’ accounts are vested immediately. In addition, employees with at least 
three months
 of service and who have reached a certain age may contribute a percentage of their salaries to the Plan as elected by each participant. The Company contributed to the Plan approximately $
3.8
 million and $
3.6
 million in 2024 and 2023 respectively, in matching contributions.
The Company maintains the Amerant Bank, N.A. Executive Deferred Compensation Plan as a non-qualified plan for eligible highly compensated employees (the “Deferred Compensation Plan”). The Deferred Compensation Plan permits deferrals of compensation above the amounts that can be contributed for retirement under the 401(k) Plan. Under the Deferred Compensation Plan, eligible employees may elect to defer all or a portion of their annual salary and cash incentive awards. Effective January 1, 2022, there were no matching contributions from the Company under the Deferred Compensation Plan. Prior to 2022, eligible employees were allowed  to receive matching contributions up to 
5
% of their annual salary if the maximum amount allowed in the 401k had been reached. All deferrals, employer contributions, earnings, and gains on each participant’s account in the Deferred Compensation Plan are vested immediately. 
d) Subsequent Events
In February 2025, the Company adopted a new form of performance based restricted stock unit agreement (the "New PSU Agreement") that will be used, starting in February 2025, in connection with the LTI Plan, a sub-plan under the 2018 Equity Plan.

The Company evaluates the deferred tax asset for recoverability using a consistent approach which considers the relative impact of negative and positive evidence, including its own historical financial performance and that of its operating subsidiaries and projections of future taxable income. This evaluation involves significant judgment by management about assumptions that are subject to change from period to period. Management believes that the weight of all the positive evidence currently available exceeds the negative evidence in support of the realization of the future tax benefits associated with the federal net deferred tax asset. As a result, management has concluded that the federal net deferred tax asset in its entirety will more likely than not be realized. Therefore, a valuation allowance is not considered necessary. If future results differ significantly from the Company’s current projections, a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax asset may be required.
At December 31, 2024, the Company had approximately $
49.6
 million of federal net operating losses ("NOLs"), which can be carried forward indefinitely. The deferred tax asset related to the federal NOLs is approximately $
10.4
 million.
At December 31, 2024, Amerant Bank, N.A. standalone had approximately $
97.7
 million of NOLs in the state of Florida, which can be carried forward indefinitely. The deferred tax asset related to these state NOLs is approximately $
4.3
 million. A valuation allowance has not been recorded against the state deferred tax asset related to these NOLs as management believes it is more likely than not that the tax benefit will be realized.

At December 31, 2024 and 2023, Amerant Bancorp Inc. standalone had accumulated NOLs in the State of Florida of approximately $
159.2
 million and $
160.2
 million, respectively. These NOLs are carried forward for a maximum of 20 years or indefinitely, depending on the year generated, based on applicable Florida law. The deferred tax asset related to these NOLs at December 31, 2024 and 2023 is approximately $
6.9
 million and $
7.0
 million, respectively. A valuation allowance has been recorded against the state deferred tax asset as management believes it is more likely than not that the tax benefit will not be realized. 
At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had 
no
 unrecognized tax benefits or associated interest or penalties that needed to be accrued. 
The Company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return as well as combined state income tax returns where combined filings are required. The federal and state tax returns for years 2021 through 2024 remain subject to examination by the corresponding tax jurisdictions.

Repurchase Plans Details
On December 19, 2022, the Company announced that the Board of Directors authorized a new repurchase program pursuant to which the Company may purchase, from time to time, up to an aggregate amount of $
25
 million of its shares of Class A common stock (the “2023 Class A Common Stock Repurchase Program”). The 2023 Class A Common Stock Repurchase Program was set to expire on December 31, 2023 and on December 15, 2023, the Company announced that the Board approved to extend the expiration date to December 31, 2024. On December 11, 2024, the Company announced that the Board approved to extend the expiration date to December 31, 2025.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company repurchased an aggregate of 
344,326
 and 
259,853
 shares, respectively, of Class A common stock at a weighted average price of $
21.94
 and $
18.98
 per share, under the 2023 Class A Common Stock Repurchase Program. The aggregate purchase price for these transactions was $
7.6
 million and $
4.9
 million, respectively, in the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, including transaction costs.  At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had $
12.4
 million and $
20
 million available, respectively, for repurchase under this repurchase program.

50
 million of its shares of Class A common stock (the “New Class A Common Stock Repurchase Program”). Under the New Class A Common Stock Repurchase Program, the Company was able to repurchase shares of Class A common stock through open market purchases, by block purchase, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise in compliance with Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act. The extent to which the Company was able to repurchase its shares of Class A common stock and the timing of such purchases depended upon market conditions, regulatory requirements, other corporate liquidity requirements and priorities and other factors as may have been considered in the Company’s sole discretion. Repurchases may also have been made pursuant to a trading plan under Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act, which would permit shares to be repurchased when the Company might otherwise be precluded from doing so because of self-imposed trading blackout periods or other regulatory restrictions. The New Class A Common Stock Repurchase Program did not obligate the Company to repurchase any particular amount of shares of Class A common stock, and may have been suspended or discontinued at any time without notice. In 2022, the Company repurchased an aggregate of 
1,602,887
 shares of Class A common stock at a weighted average price of $

 per share, under the New Class A Common Stock Repurchase Program. The aggregate purchase price for these transactions was approximately $
49.9

Commitments and Contingencies
From time to time the Company and its subsidiaries may be exposed to loss contingencies. In the ordinary, course of business, those contingencies may include, known but unasserted claims, and legal / regulatory inquiries or examinations. The Company records these loss contingencies as a liability when the likelihood of loss is probable and an amount or range of loss can be reasonably estimated. In the opinion of management, the Company maintains a liability that is in an estimated amount sufficient to cover said loss contingencies, if any, at the reporting dates. There was no material liability on legal claims outstanding as of December 31, 2024.
The Company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit, derivative contracts, and letters of credit. Most of our derivative arrangements with counterparties require the posting of collateral upon meeting certain net exposure threshold.
The Company’s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for loan commitments and letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. The Company uses the same credit policies in making loan commitments and letters of credit as it does for on-balance sheet instruments. The Company controls the credit risk of loan commitments and letters of credit through credit approvals, customer limits, and monitoring procedures. 
Loan commitments are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Loan commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. The Company evaluates each customer’s credit-worthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Company upon extension of credit, is based on management’s credit evaluation. Collateral held varies but may include cash, accounts receivable, inventory, property and equipment, real estate in varying stages of development and occupancy, and income-producing commercial properties. 
Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Those guarantees are primarily issued to support borrowing arrangements. They generally have one year terms and are renewable annually, if agreed. The credit risk involved in issuing standby letters of credit is generally the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. The Company generally holds deposits, investments and real estate as collateral supporting those commitments. The extent of collateral held for those commitments at December 31, 2024 ranges from unsecured commitments to commitments fully collateralized by cash and securities. 
Commercial letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company to guarantee payment by a customer to a third party, and are used primarily for importing or exporting goods and are terminated when proper payment is made by the customer.
Financial instruments whose contract amount represents off-balance sheet credit risk at December 31, 2024 are generally short-term and are as follows:

Level 2 Valuation Techniques
The valuation of short-term securities, debt securities available for sale, equity securities not held for trading, and derivative instruments is performed through a monthly pricing process using data provided by generally recognized providers of independent data pricing services (the “Pricing Providers”).  These Pricing Providers collect, use and incorporate descriptive market data from various sources, quotes and indicators from leading broker dealers to generate independent and objective valuations. The fair value of mortgage loans held for sale is generally determined using observable market information including pricing from actual market transactions, investor commitment  prices or broker quotations on similar loans. The fair value of bank-owned life insurance policies is based on the cash surrender values of the policies as reported by the insurance companies.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022
The valuation techniques and the inputs used in our consolidated financial statements to measure the fair value of our recurring Level 2 financial instruments consider, among other factors, the following:
•
Similar securities actively traded which are selected from recent market transactions;
•
Observable market data which includes spreads in relationship to SOFR  and other relevant interest rate benchmarks that may become available from time to time, such as swap curve, and prepayment speed rates, as applicable.
•
The captured spread and prepayment speed is used to obtain the fair value for each related security.
      On a quarterly basis, the Company evaluates the reasonableness of the monthly pricing process for the valuation of short-term securities, debt securities available for sale and equity securities not held for trading and derivative instruments.  When appropriate, this evaluation includes challenging a random sample of the different types of securities in the investment portfolio as of the end of the quarter selected.  This challenge consists of obtaining from the Pricing Providers a document explaining the methodology applied to obtain their fair value assessments for each type of investment included in the sample selection.  The Company then analyzes in detail the various inputs used in the fair value calculation, both observable and unobservable (e.g., prepayment speeds, yield curve benchmarks, spreads, delinquency rates).  Management considers that the consistent application of this methodology allows the Company to understand and evaluate the categorization of its investment portfolio.
The methods described above may produce a fair value calculation that may differ from the net realizable value or may not be reflective of future fair values.  Furthermore, while the Company believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of its financial instruments could result in different estimates of fair value at the reporting date.
Level 3 Valuation Techniques
Mortgage Servicing Rights 
MSRs are initially and subsequently measured at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded as part of noninterest income. The Company estimates the fair value of MSRs through the use of prevailing market participants assumptions and market participant valuation processes. This valuation is periodically tested and validated against other third-party firm valuations.
There were no transfers in or out of level 3 in the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.

Loans Held for Sale, at Lower of Fair Value or Cost
The fair value used for loans held for sale that are carried at the lower of cost or fair value is generally based on quoted market prices of similar loans less estimated cost to sell and is considered to be Level 3.
Collateral Dependent Loans Measured For Expected Credit Losses
The carrying amount of collateral dependent loans is typically based on the fair value of the underlying collateral. The Company primarily uses third party appraisals to assist in measuring expected credit losses on collateral dependent loans. The Company also uses third party appraisal reviewers for loans with an outstanding balance of $
1
 million and above. These appraisals generally use the market or income approach valuation technique and use market observable data to formulate an opinion of the fair value of the loan’s collateral. However, the appraiser uses professional judgment in determining the fair value of the collateral or properties and may also adjust these values for changes in market conditions subsequent to the appraisal date. When current appraisals are not available for certain loans, the Company uses judgment on market conditions to adjust the most current appraisal. The sales prices may reflect prices of sales contracts not closed and the amount of time required to sell out the real estate project may be derived from current appraisals of similar projects. As a consequence, the fair value of the collateral is considered a Level 3 valuation.

Other Real Estate Owned
The Company values OREO at the lower of cost or fair value of the property, less cost to sell. The fair value of the property is generally based upon recent appraisal values of the property, less cost to sell. The Company primarily uses third party appraisals to assist in measuring the valuation of OREO. Period revaluations are classified as level 3 as the assumptions used may not be observable. The fair value of non-real estate repossessed assets is provided by a third party based on their assumptions and quoted market prices for similar assets, when available. In 2024, the Company recorded valuation expense of $
5.7
 million on this OREO property, as result of the fair value adjustment. The Company had OREO balances of $
18.1
 million and $
20.2
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The fair value of a financial instrument represents the price that would be received from its sale in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  The best indication of the fair value of a financial instrument is determined based upon quoted market prices.  However, in many cases, there are no quoted market prices for the Company’s various financial instruments.  As a result, the Company derives the fair value of the financial instruments held at the reporting period-end, in part, using present value or other valuation techniques.  Those techniques are significantly affected by management’s assumptions, the estimated amount and timing of future cash flows and estimated discount rates included in present value and other techniques.  The use of different assumptions could significantly affect the estimated fair values of the Company’s financial instruments.  Accordingly, the net realized values could be materially different from the estimates presented below.
The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that value:
•
Because of their nature and short-term maturities, the carrying values of the following financial instruments were used as a reasonable estimate of their fair value: cash and cash equivalents, interest earning deposits with banks, variable-rate loans with re-pricing terms shorter than twelve months, demand and savings deposits, short-term time deposits and other borrowings.
•
The fair value of mortgage loans held for sale at fair value and loans held for sale carried at the lower of cost or fair value, debt and equity securities, bank owned life insurance and derivative instruments, are based on quoted market prices, when available.  If quoted market prices are unavailable, fair value is estimated using the pricing process described in Note 20.
•
The fair value of commitments and letters of credit is based on the assumption that the Company will be required to perform on all such instruments.  The commitment amount approximates estimated fair value.
•
The fair value of fixed-rate loans, advances from the FHLB, senior notes, subordinated notes and junior subordinated debentures are estimated using a present value technique by discounting the future expected contractual cash flows using the current rates at which similar instruments would be issued with comparable credit ratings and terms at the measurement date.
•
The fair value of long-term time deposits, including certificates of deposit, is determined using a present value technique by discounting the future expected contractual cash flows using current rates at which similar instruments would be issued at the measurement date.

Regulatory Matters
The Company and the Bank are subject to various regulatory requirements administered by federal banking agencies. Amerant Mortgage is an approved Fannie Mae seller and servicer and is subject to certain Lender Adjusted Net Worth requirements. Amerant Investments is subject to the Uniform Capital Rule 15x3-1 under the Securities Act of 1934, which requires the maintenance of minimum net capital as defined under such rule. At December 31, 2024 and 2023 Amerant Investments was in compliance with those rules.
The following is a summary of restrictions related to dividend payments, and capital adequacy as well as Lender Adjusted Net Worth requirement. 
Dividend Restrictions 
Dividends payable by the Bank as a national bank subsidiary of the Company, are limited by law and OCC regulations. A dividend may not be paid if the total of all dividends declared by a bank in any calendar year is in excess of the current year’s net income combined with the retained net income of the two preceding years, unless the national bank obtains the approval of the OCC. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Bank could have paid dividends of $
9.3
 million and $
117.3
 million, respectively, without prior OCC approval. In December 2023, the Board of Directors of the Bank approved the payment of cash dividend of $
20
 million by the Bank to the Company. The Company received this dividend in the first quarter of 2024. The Bank did 
no
t declare any dividends payable to the Company in 2024. 
In addition, the Company and the Bank are subject to various general regulatory policies and requirements relating to the payment of dividends, including requirements to maintain capital above regulatory minimums and the maintenance of capital in excess of capital conservation buffers required by the Federal Reserve and OCC capital regulations.

Capital Adequacy 
Under the Basel III capital and prompt corrective action rules, the Company and the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures and qualitative judgments about capital components, risk weightings, and other factors. 
The Basel III rules became effective for the Company and the Bank on January 1, 2015 with full compliance with all of the requirements being phased in by January 1, 2019. The Company and the Bank opted to not include the AOCI in computing regulatory capital. As of December 31, 2024, management believes that the Company and the Bank meet all capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject, and are well capitalized. In addition, Basel III rules required the Company and the Bank to hold a minimum capital conservation buffer of 
2.50
%. The Company’s capital conservation buffer at year end 2024 and 2023 was 
5.4
% and 
4.1
%, respectively, and therefore no regulatory restrictions exist under the applicable capital rules on dividends or discretionary bonuses or other payments.

Mortgage Banking Lender Net Worth Adjusted Requirements 
Amerant Mortgage is currently an approved seller and servicer with Fannie Mae for the purpose of selling Fannie Mae eligible loan production and retaining the MSRs of those same loans. As an approved Fannie Mae seller and servicer, Amerant Mortgage must meet certain net worth covenants outlined in Maintaining Seller/Servicer Eligibility section of the Fannie Mae Selling Guide, the “Selling Guide”.
Under the Selling Guide, Amerant Mortgage must meet a minimum net worth requirement of $
2.5
 million plus 
0.25
% of the outstanding unpaid principal balance of the portfolio of loans Amerant Mortgage is contractually obligated to service for Fannie Mae and other investors  (the “Lender Adjusted Net Worth”). As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, Amerant Mortgage had a Lender Adjusted Net Worth of approximately $
15.9
 million and $
11.0
 million and was in compliance with the requirement. In addition, Amerant Mortgage is subject to net worth decline tolerance requirements that shall not exceed 
25
% over one quarter or 
40
% over two consecutive quarters. Amerant Mortgage has demonstrated compliance with all financial eligibility requirements as of December 31, 2024.
Failure to meet the minimum net worth or net worth decline tolerance outlined above, may prompt the suspension  of Amerant Mortgage as an approved seller and/or servicer, which would prevent Amerant Mortgage from taking down new commitments to deliver loans to Fannie Mae and adding loans to any portfolio that Amerant Mortgage services for Fannie Mae. While Amerant Mortgage is not required to operate as an approved Fannie Mae seller and servicer, failure to operate as such may impact Amerant Mortgage’s overall margins, profitability and financial flexibility.

As of December 31, 2024, potential dilutive instruments consisted of unvested shares of restricted stock and restricted stock units totaling

595,420
 and 
529,830
, respectively. 
In 2024, potential dilutive instruments were not included in the diluted earnings per share computation because the Company reported a net loss and their inclusion would have an anti-dilutive effect in per share earnings in that period. In 2023 and 2022, potential dilutive instruments were included in the diluted earnings per share computation because, when the unamortized deferred compensation cost related to these shares was divided by the average market price per share in those periods, fewer shares would have been purchased than restricted shares assumed issued. Therefore, in those periods, such awards resulted in higher diluted weighted average shares outstanding than basic weighted average shares outstanding, and had a dilutive effect in per share earnings.

Condensed Unconsolidated Holding Companies’ Financial Statements 
The separate condensed unconsolidated financial statements of the Company has been prepared using the same basis of accounting that the Company used to prepare its consolidated financial statements described in Note 1, except for its investment in subsidiaries which is accounted for using the equity method. Under the equity method, investments in subsidiaries are initially recorded at cost, and they are periodically adjusted due to changes in the interest of the parent company over the net assets of the subsidiaries. The Company records in the results for the period, its participation in the profit or loss of the subsidiaries, and in AOCI/AOCL its participation in the “Other comprehensive (loss) income account” of the subsidiary. In applying the equity method, the Company uses the subsidiaries consolidated financial statements at the end of the period prepared under GAAP.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022
On August 2, 2022, the Company completed an intercompany transaction of entities under common control, pursuant to which the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, Amerant Florida Bancorp Inc. (“Amerant Florida”), merged with and into the Company, with the Company as sole survivor (the “Amerant Florida Merger”). In connection with the Amerant Florida Merger, the Company assumed all assets and liabilities of Amerant Florida, including its direct ownership of the Bank, the common capital securities issued by the 
five
 trust subsidiaries, and the junior subordinated debentures issued by Amerant Florida and related agreements. The Amerant Florida Merger had no impact to the Company’s consolidated financial condition and results of operations. 
There were no reportable balances as of and for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 or 2022 related to Amerant Florida as of result of the Amerant Florida Merger.

Segment Information
Determination of the CODM
The Company’s Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) is its Chief Executive Officer (CEO). The CEO makes the overall decisions about the Company’s resource allocation and assesses the performance of the Company.
Determination and Identification of operating segments
The CODM  manages the Company as 
one
 operating segment: the consolidated Company as one entity. We made that determination based upon an evaluation of the products and services provided, the functions the Company performed, and the type and location of customers served. Substantially, all of our revenues, assets, and liabilities are derived from deposits, loans, and wealth management services primarily offered in the United States to customers located in the United States and abroad.  All decisions regarding the allocation of financial, operational, and other resources are managed under this 
one
 segment. As part of the determination for the allocation of resources, the CODM regularly reviews net income as the measure of profit or loss. The accounting policies used to measure the profit and loss are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies in Note 1.  In addition, as part of assessment of the performance of the consolidated entity, the CODM also reviews the consolidated financial statements for significant expenses which include both cash and noncash items, such as amortization and depreciation and stock-based compensation. For more information on the significant components of net (loss) income or any significant cash or noncash items, refer to our accompanying consolidated financial statements or the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained within. The measure of assets is reported on the consolidated balance sheet as total consolidated assets.
Segment results 
As the Company’s consolidated financial information as of and for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 conform with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP) and the Company is managed on a single operating business segment, we collectively refer to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the Segment Results for the measures of consolidated profit or loss, as well as consolidated total assets.
