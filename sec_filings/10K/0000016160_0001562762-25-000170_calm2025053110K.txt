ITEM 1.
 
BUSINESS 
 
Our Business 
We are the largest producer and distributor of shell eggs in the United States. Our mission is to be the most sustainable producer 
and
 
reliable
 
supplier
 
of
 
consistent,
 
high
 
quality
 
fresh
 
shell
 
eggs,
 
egg
 
products
 
and
 
prepared
 
foods
 
in
 
the
 
United
 
States.
 
Our 
operating approach is built around operational
 
excellence, a "Culture of Sustainability" and
 
creating value for our stockholders, 
customers, team
 
members and
 
communities. We
 
sell most
 
of our
 
products throughout
 
much of
 
the United
 
States (“U.S.”)
 
and 
aim
 
to
 
maintain
 
efficient,
 
state-of-the-art
 
operations
 
located
 
close
 
to
 
our
 
customers.
 
We
 
were
 
founded
 
in
 
1957
 
and
 
are 
headquartered in Ridgeland,
 
Mississippi. 
The Company has
 
one operating and
 
one reporting segment,
 
which is the
 
production, packaging, marketing
 
and distribution of 
shell eggs, egg
 
products and prepared
 
foods. Our integrated
 
operations consist
 
of hatching chicks,
 
growing and
 
maintaining flocks 








5 
of pullets, layers and breeders,
 
manufacturing feed, and producing,
 
processing, packaging, and distributing
 
shell eggs. Layers are 
mature female chickens,
 
pullets are female
 
chickens usually less
 
than 18 weeks
 
of age, and
 
breeders are male
 
and female chickens 
used to
 
produce fertile
 
eggs to
 
be hatched
 
for egg
 
production flocks.
 
Our total
 
flock as
 
of May
 
31, 2025
 
consisted of
 
approximately 
48.3 million layers and 11.5 million pullets and breeders. 
Many of our customers rely on us to provide most of their
 
shell egg needs, including specialty and conventional eggs. Specialty 
eggs encompass
 
a broad
 
range of
 
products. We
 
classify cage-free,
 
organic, brown,
 
free-range, pasture-raised
 
and nutritionally 
enhanced eggs as specialty
 
eggs for accounting and
 
reporting purposes. We classify all other shell
 
eggs as conventional products. 
While we report separate sales information for these egg types, there are many cost factors that are not specifically available for 
conventional or
 
specialty eggs
 
due to
 
the nature
 
of egg
 
production. We
 
manage our
 
operations and
 
allocate resources
 
to these 
types of eggs on a consolidated basis based on the demands of our customers. 
We believe that one
 
of our important
 
competitive advantages
 
is our ability
 
to meet our
 
customers’ evolving
 
needs with a
 
favorable 
product mix of conventional
 
and specialty eggs, including
 
cage-free, organic, brown, free-range,
 
pasture-raised and nutritionally-
enhanced eggs, as well as
 
egg products and prepared foods.
 
While a small part of
 
our current business, demand for
 
the free-range 
and pasture-raised eggs we produce and sell continues to grow. They represent attractive offerings to a subset of consumers, and 
therefore our
 
customers, and
 
help us
 
continue to
 
serve as
 
the trusted
 
provider of
 
quality food
 
choices. We
 
have expanded
 
our 
prepared foods
 
product offerings,
 
including with
 
our strategic
 
investment in
 
Crepini Foods,
 
LLC in
 
September 2024,
 
and our 
acquisition of Echo Lake Foods, LLC (formerly Echo Lake Foods, Inc.) and certain related companies (collectively “Echo Lake 
Foods”) subsequent to the end of our 2025 fiscal year. 
Throughout
 
the
 
Company’s
 
history,
 
we
 
have
 
acquired
 
other
 
businesses
 
in
 
our
 
industry.
 
Since
 
1989,
 
we
 
have
 
acquired
 
and 
integrated 25 businesses. Subsequent to the end of our 2025 fiscal year,
 
we acquired our 26
th
 
business when we purchased Echo 
Lake
 
Foods.

Industry Background 
According to the
 
U.S. Department of
 
Agriculture (“USDA”) Agricultural
 
Marketing Service, in
 
2024 approximately 71%
 
of table 
eggs produced in the U.S. were sold as shell eggs, with 57% sold through food-at-home outlets such
 
as grocery and convenience 
stores, 12%
 
sold to
 
food-away-from home
 
channels such
 
as restaurants
 
and 2%
 
exported. The
 
USDA estimated
 
that in
 
2024 
approximately 29% of eggs produced in
 
the U.S. were sold as egg
 
products (shell eggs broken and sold
 
in liquid, frozen, or dried 
form) to institutions
 
(e.g. companies
 
producing baked
 
goods). For
 
information about
 
egg producers
 
in the
 
U.S., see
 
“Competition” 
below.
 
Our industry has been greatly impacted by several outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (“HPAI”) in recent years. For 
additional information regarding HPAI and its impact on our industry and business, see 
Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors
 
and 
Part II. 
Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - HPAI
.
Given historical
 
consumption trends,
 
we believe
 
that general
 
demand for
 
eggs in
 
the U.S.
 
increases basically
 
in line
 
with the 
overall
 
U.S.
 
population
 
growth;
 
however,
 
specific
 
events
 
can
 
impact
 
egg
 
supply
 
and
 
consumption
 
in
 
a
 
particular
 
period,
 
as 
occurred with the
 
2015 HPAI outbreak, the COVID-19
 
pandemic (particularly during
 
2020), and the
 
most recent HPAI outbreaks 
starting
 
in
 
early
 
2022.
 
For
 
fiscal
 
2025,
 
shell
 
egg
 
household
 
penetration
 
is
 
approximately
 
97%.
 
According
 
to
 
the
 
USDA’s 
Economic Research
 
Service, estimated
 
annual per
 
capita consumption
 
in the
 
United States
 
between 2020
 
and 2024
 
varied, ranging 
from 271 to 288 eggs which is directly impacted by available supply.
 
The USDA calculates per capita consumption by dividing 
total shell egg disappearance in the U.S. by the U.S. population.
 
The most significant
 
shift in demand in
 
recent years has been
 
among specialty eggs, particularly
 
cage-free eggs. For additional 
information, see “Specialty Eggs” below. 










6 
Prices for Shell Eggs 
Wholesale shell egg
 
sales prices are
 
a critical component
 
of revenue for
 
the Company.
 
Wholesale shell egg
 
prices are volatile, 
cyclical, and impacted by
 
a number of factors, including
 
consumer demand, seasonal fluctuations, the
 
number and productivity 
of laying
 
hens in
 
the U.S.
 
and outbreaks
 
of agricultural
 
diseases such
 
as HPAI.
 
We
 
believe the
 
majority of
 
conventional shell 
eggs sold in
 
the U.S.
 
in the retail
 
and foodservice
 
channels are sold
 
at prices
 
that take into
 
account, in
 
varying ways, independently 
quoted and certified wholesale market prices,
 
such as those published by Urner
 
Barry Publications, Inc. (“UB”) or the
 
USDA for 
shell eggs; however, grain-based or variations of cost plus arrangements are also commonly utilized.
 
Wholesale prices for cage-free
 
eggs are quoted by
 
independent sources such as
 
UB and USDA. There
 
is no independently quoted 
wholesale
 
market
 
price
 
for
 
other
 
specialty
 
eggs
 
such
 
as
 
nutritionally
 
enhanced,
 
organic,
 
pasture-raise
 
and
 
free-range
 
eggs. 
Specialty eggs are typically sold at prices and terms negotiated directly with customers and in the case of cage-free eggs, can be 
sold at
 
prices that
 
take into
 
account independently
 
quoted markets.
 
Historically,
 
prices for
 
specialty eggs
 
have generally
 
been 
higher due to customer and consumer willingness to pay more for specialty eggs. 
The weekly average price
 
for the southeast region
 
for large white
 
conventional shell eggs as
 
quoted by UB is
 
shown below for 
the past three fiscal years along
 
with the five-year average price. The
 
actual prices that we realize on
 
any given transaction will 
not necessarily equal
 
quoted market prices
 
because of the
 
individualized terms that
 
we negotiate with
 
individual customers which 
are influenced
 
by many
 
factors. As
 
further discussed
 
in 
Part II.
 
Item 7.
 
Management’s
 
Discussion and
 
Analysis –
 
Results of 
Operations
, egg prices in fiscal 2023 through fiscal 2025 were significantly impacted by HPAI. 
Our pricing for
 
shell eggs is
 
negotiated with our
 
customers on individual
 
terms. We sell our shell
 
eggs at prices
 
based on formulas 
that take into account,
 
in varying ways, independently
 
quoted regional wholesale market
 
prices for shell eggs,
 
formulas related 
to
 
our
 
costs of
 
production,
 
such
 
as
 
grain-based
 
and variations
 
of
 
cost-plus arrangements,
 
or
 
hybrid models
 
including cost
 
of 
production and wholesale market prices. 
The majority of our conventional eggs are priced and sold under frameworks
 
that generally utilize market-based formulas tied to 
independently quoted regional wholesale market
 
quotes.
 
The majority of our
 
specialty eggs are sold
 
under frameworks that do 
not utilize market-based formulas, although we do have some customers that prefer market-based pricing for cage-free eggs. As 
a result, specialty
 
egg prices typically
 
do not fluctuate
 
as much as
 
conventional pricing. We do not
 
sell eggs directly
 
to consumers 
or set the prices at which eggs are sold to consumers.
 










7 
 
Depending on market conditions, input costs and individualized contract terms,
 
the price we receive per dozen eggs in any
 
given 
transaction may be more than or less than our production cost per dozen. 
Feed Costs for Shell Egg Production 
Feed is a primary
 
cost component in the
 
production of shell eggs
 
and represented 53.4%
 
of our fiscal 2025
 
farm production costs. 
We routinely fill our
 
feed storage bins
 
during harvest season
 
when prices for
 
feed ingredients, primarily
 
corn and to
 
a lesser extent 
soybean meal, are
 
generally lower.
 
To
 
ensure continued availability
 
of feed ingredients,
 
we may enter
 
into contracts for
 
future 
purchases of
 
corn and
 
soybean meal,
 
and as
 
part of
 
these contracts,
 
we may
 
lock-in the
 
basis portion
 
of our
 
grain purchases 
several months
 
in advance.
 
Basis is
 
the difference
 
between the
 
local cash
 
price for
 
grain and
 
the applicable
 
futures price.
 
The 
difference can
 
be due
 
to transportation
 
costs, storage
 
costs, supply
 
and demand,
 
local conditions
 
and other
 
factors. A
 
basis contract 
is a common
 
transaction in the grain
 
market that allows us
 
to lock-in a
 
basis level for a
 
specific delivery period and
 
wait to set 
the futures price at a later date. Furthermore, due to the
 
more limited supply for organic ingredients,
 
we may commit to purchase 
organic
 
ingredients
 
in
 
advance
 
to
 
help
 
assure
 
supply.
 
Ordinarily,
 
we
 
do
 
not
 
enter
 
into
 
long-term
 
contracts
 
beyond
 
a
 
year
 
to 
purchase corn
 
and soybean
 
meal or
 
hedge against
 
increases in
 
the prices
 
of corn
 
and soybean
 
meal. As
 
the quality
 
and composition 
of feed
 
is a
 
critical factor
 
in the
 
nutritional value
 
of shell
 
eggs and
 
health of
 
our chickens,
 
we formulate
 
and produce
 
the vast 
majority of our own feed at our feed mills located near our production plants. Our annual feed requirements for fiscal
 
2025 were 
2.1 million tons
 
of finished
 
feed, of
 
which we
 
manufactured 1.9 million
 
tons. We currently
 
have the
 
capacity to
 
store 215
 
thousand 
tons of corn and soybean meal, and we replenish these stores as needed throughout the year.
 
Our primary feed ingredients, corn and soybean meal, are commodities that are subject to volatile price changes due to weather, 
various supply
 
and demand
 
factors, transportation
 
and storage
 
costs, speculators,
 
agricultural, energy
 
and trade
 
policies in
 
the 
U.S. and internationally, and global instability that could disrupt
 
the supply chain. We purchase the vast majority of
 
our corn and 
soybean meal from U.S sources but may be forced to purchase internationally when U.S. supplies are not readily
 
available. Feed 
grains are currently available
 
from an adequate number
 
of sources in the
 
U.S. As a point
 
of reference, a multi-year
 
comparison 
of the average of
 
daily closing prices per
 
Chicago Board of Trade for
 
each quarter in our
 
fiscal years 2021-2025 are
 
shown below 
for corn and soybean meal: 








8 
Shell Egg Production 
Our percentage of dozens produced to sold was 88.6% of our total shell eggs sold in fiscal 2025. We supplement our production 
through purchases of eggs from
 
others when needed. The quantity
 
of eggs purchased will vary
 
based on many factors such
 
as our 
own production capabilities and current market conditions. In fiscal 2025, 90.8% of our production came
 
from Company-owned 
facilities, and
 
9.2% from
 
contract producers.
 
The majority
 
of our
 
contract production
 
is with
 
family-owned farms
 
for organic, 
pasture-raised and free-range eggs. Under a typical arrangement with a contract producer, we own the flock, furnish all feed and 
critical supplies, own
 
the shell eggs
 
produced and assume market
 
risks. The contract
 
producers own and
 
operate their facilities 
and are paid a fee based on production with incentives for performance.
 
 
The commercial production of shell eggs requires a source of baby
 
chicks for laying flock replacement. We
 
supply the majority 
of our
 
chicks from
 
our breeder
 
farms
 
and hatch
 
them in
 
our hatcheries
 
in a
 
computer-controlled environment
 
and obtain
 
the 
balance from commercial sources. The
 
chicks are grown in our
 
own pullet farms and
 
are placed into the laying
 
flock once they 
reach maturity. 
After eggs
 
are produced,
 
they are
 
cleaned, graded
 
and packaged.
 
Substantially all
 
our farms
 
have modern
 
“in-line” facilities
 
which 
mechanically
 
gather,
 
clean,
 
grade
 
and
 
package
 
the
 
eggs
 
at
 
the
 
location
 
where
 
they
 
are
 
laid.
 
The
 
in-line
 
facilities
 
generate 
significant efficiencies
 
and cost savings
 
compared to the
 
cost of
 
eggs produced from
 
non-in-line facilities, which
 
process eggs 
that
 
have
 
been
 
laid
 
at
 
another
 
location
 
and
 
transported
 
to the
 
processing facility.
 
The
 
in-line facilities
 
also
 
produce a
 
higher 
percentage of USDA Grade A
 
eggs, which sell at higher
 
prices. Eggs produced on farms
 
owned by contractors are brought
 
to our 
processing plants to
 
be graded and
 
packaged. We maintain a Safe
 
Quality Food (“SQF”)
 
Management Program which
 
is overseen 
by our Food Safety Department and
 
senior management team. As of May
 
31, 2025, every Company-owned processing
 
plant was 
SQF certified. Because shell
 
eggs are perishable, we
 
do not maintain large egg
 
inventories. Our egg inventory
 
averaged five days 
of sales during
 
fiscal 2025. We
 
believe our constant
 
focus on production
 
efficiencies and automation
 
throughout our vertically 
integrated operations enable us to be a low-cost supplier in our markets. 
We
 
are
 
proud
 
to
 
have
 
created,
 
implemented
 
and
 
maintained
 
what
 
we
 
believe
 
is
 
a
 
leading
 
poultry
 
Animal
 
Welfare
 
Program 
(“AWP”).
 
We
 
have aligned our
 
AWP
 
with regulatory,
 
veterinary and our
 
third-party certifying bodies’
 
guidance to govern
 
the 
welfare of animals in
 
our direct care and
 
our contract farmers’ care.
 
We
 
continually review our program to
 
monitor and evolve 
standards that guide how
 
we hatch chicks, rear pullets
 
and nurture breeder and layer
 
hens. At each stage of
 
our animals’ lives, we 
are dedicated to providing welfare conditions aligned to our commitment to the principles of the internationally recognized 
Five 
Freedoms of Animal Welfare
.
 
We
 
do not
 
use artificial
 
hormones in
 
the production
 
of our
 
eggs. Hormone
 
use in
 
the poultry
 
and egg
 
production industry
 
has 
been
 
effectively
 
banned in
 
the U.S.
 
since the
 
1950s. We
 
have an
 
extensive written
 
protocol that
 
allows the
 
use of
 
medically 
important
 
antibiotics
 
only
 
when
 
animal
 
health
 
is
 
at
 
risk,
 
consistent
 
with
 
guidance
 
from
 
the
 
United
 
States
 
Food
 
and
 
Drug 
Administration
 
(“FDA”)
 
and
 
the
 
Guidance
 
for
 
Judicious
 
Therapeutic
 
Use
 
of
 
Antimicrobials
 
in
 
Poultry,
 
developed
 
by
 
the 
American Association of
 
Avian Pathologists. When antibiotics are
 
medically necessary, a licensed veterinary
 
doctor will approve 
and
 
administer
 
approved
 
doses
 
for
 
a
 
restricted
 
period.
 
We
 
do
 
not
 
use
 
antibiotics
 
for
 
growth
 
promotion
 
or
 
performance 
enhancement. 
Specialty Eggs 
We
 
are
 
one
 
of
 
the
 
largest
 
producers
 
and
 
marketers
 
of
 
value-added
 
specialty
 
shell
 
eggs
 
in
 
the
 
U.S.,
 
which
 
continues
 
to
 
be
 
a 
significant and
 
growing segment
 
of the market.
 
We classify cage-free, organic,
 
brown, free-range,
 
pasture-raised and
 
nutritionally 
enhanced as specialty eggs
 
for accounting and reporting
 
purposes. Specialty eggs are
 
intended to meet
 
the demands of consumers 
sensitive to environmental, health and/or animal welfare issues and to comply with state requirements for cage-free
 
eggs.
 
Ten
 
states
 
in
 
the
 
U.S.
 
have
 
passed
 
legislation
 
or
 
regulations
 
mandating
 
minimum
 
space
 
or
 
cage-free
 
requirements
 
for
 
egg 
production or
 
mandated the
 
sale of
 
only cage-free
 
eggs and
 
egg products
 
in their states,
 
with implementation
 
of these laws
 
ranging 
from January 2022 to January
 
2030. These states represent approximately
 
27% of the U.S. total
 
population according to the 2020 
U.S. Census.
 
California, Massachusetts,
 
Colorado, Michigan,
 
Oregon, Washington,
 
and Nevada,
 
which collectively
 
represent 
approximately 23% of the total estimated
 
U.S. population, have cage-free legislation in
 
effect.
 
Due to the national egg
 
shortage 
caused by HPAI, Nevada temporarily suspended its cage-free egg mandate and other states are considering similar actions.
 
A significant
 
number of
 
our customers
 
previously announced
 
goals to
 
either exclusively
 
offer
 
cage-free eggs
 
or significantly 
increase the volume
 
of cage-free egg
 
sales in the
 
future, subject in
 
most cases to
 
availability of supply, affordability
 
and consumer 
demand, among other
 
contingencies. Our
 
customers typically
 
do not commit
 
to long-term purchases
 
of specific
 
quantities or types 
of eggs with us, and as a result,
 
it is difficult to accurately predict customer requirements for
 
cage-free eggs. We
 
are focused on 








9 
adjusting our cage-free
 
production capacity with
 
a goal of
 
meeting the future
 
needs of our
 
customers in light
 
of changing state 
requirements
 
and
 
our
 
customer’s
 
goals.
 
As
 
always,
 
we
 
strive
 
to
 
offer
 
a
 
product
 
mix
 
that
 
aligns
 
with
 
current
 
and
 
anticipated 
customer purchase decisions. We are engaging with our customers to help them meet their announced goals and needs. We have 
invested
 
significant
 
capital
 
in
 
recent
 
years
 
to
 
acquire
 
and
 
construct
 
cage-free
 
facilities,
 
and
 
we
 
expect
 
our
 
focus
 
for
 
future 
expansion will continue to include cage-free facilities. Our volume of cage-free egg
 
sales has continued to increase and account 
for a larger share of our product mix. Cage-free egg revenue represented approximately
 
22.5% of our total net shell egg sales for 
fiscal year
 
2025. At
 
the same
 
time, we
 
understand the
 
importance of
 
our continued
 
ability to
 
provide affordable
 
conventional 
eggs in order to provide our customers with a variety of egg choices and to address hunger in our communities. 
Branded Eggs 
We are a member of the Eggland’s Best, Inc. cooperative (“EB”) and produce, market, distribute and sell 
Egg-Land’s
 
Best®
 
and 
Land O’
 
Lakes®
 
branded eggs under
 
license from EB
 
at our facilities
 
under EB guidelines.
 
EB hens
 
are fed a
 
proprietary diet 
and offerings
 
include nutritionally
 
enhanced, cage-free,
 
organic, pasture-raised
 
and free-range
 
eggs. 
Land O’
 
Lakes®
 
branded 
eggs are produced by hens that are fed a whole-grain vegetarian diet and include brown, organic and cage-free eggs. 
In 2024, EB
 
was the third
 
best-selling dairy brand
 
in the U.S.
 
The top three
 
best-selling branded specialty
 
egg SKUs in
 
2024 were 
EB branded eggs
 
and seven out
 
of 10 best-selling
 
SKUs were EB
 
branded eggs. In
 
2024, our sales
 
(including sales from
 
affiliates) 
represented approximately 50% of EB branded eggs and 46% of 
Land O’ Lakes® 
branded eggs nationwide. 
Our 
Farmhouse Eggs
® brand eggs are produced at
 
our facilities by hens that are
 
provided with a vegetarian diet. Our
 
offerings 
of 
Farmhouse Eggs
® include cage-free, organic
 
and pasture raised eggs.
 
We market organic, vegetarian and omega-3 eggs
 
under 
our 
4-Grain®
 
brand, which consists of conventional and
 
cage-free eggs. Our 
Sunups®
 
and 
Sunny Meadow® 
brands are sold as 
conventional eggs. 
We also produce, market and distribute private label specialty and conventional shell eggs to several customers. 
Egg Products and Prepared Foods 
Our egg product
 
offerings include liquid
 
and frozen egg
 
products, as well
 
as prepared foods
 
such as hard-cooked
 
eggs, egg wraps, 
protein pancakes,
 
crepes and
 
wrap-ups. Liquid
 
and frozen
 
egg products
 
are primarily
 
sold to
 
the institutional,
 
foodservice and 
food manufacturing sectors in the U.S. Prepared foods are sold primarily within the retail and foodservice channels. 
During March 2023, MeadowCreek Food,
 
LLC (“Meadowcreek”),
 
a majority-owned subsidiary,
 
began operations with a
 
focus 
on being
 
a leading
 
provider of
 
hard-cooked eggs.
 
During second
 
fiscal quarter
 
2025, we
 
acquired the
 
remaining ownership
 
interest 
in MeadowCreek and it became a wholly-owned subsidiary.
 
Effective on
 
September 9,
 
2024, we
 
completed a
 
strategic investment
 
with Crepini
 
LLC, establishing
 
a new
 
egg products
 
and 
prepared foods venture. Crepini LLC,
 
founded in 2007, grew its
 
brand throughout the U.S.
 
and in Mexico featuring egg
 
wraps, 
protein pancakes, crepes,
 
and wrap-ups, which
 
are sold online
 
and in over
 
3,500 retail stores.
 
The new entity, located in
 
Hopewell 
Junction, New
 
York,
 
operates as
 
Crepini Foods
 
LLC (“Crepini”).
 
We
 
capitalized Crepini with
 
approximately $6.75
 
million in 
cash
 
to
 
purchase
 
additional
 
equipment
 
and
 
other
 
assets
 
and
 
fund
 
working
 
capital
 
in
 
exchange
 
for
 
a
 
51%
 
interest
 
in
 
the
 
new 
venture. Crepini LLC contributed its existing assets and business in exchange for a 49% interest in the new venture. 
Subsequent
 
to
 
fiscal
 
2025,
 
we
 
acquired
 
Echo
 
Lake
 
Foods
 
for
 
approximately
 
$258
 
million.
 
Echo
 
Lake
 
Foods
 
is
 
based
 
in 
Burlington, Wisconsin and produces, packages,
 
markets and distributes prepared foods, including waffles,
 
pancakes, scrambled 
eggs, frozen cooked
 
omelets, egg patties, toast
 
and diced eggs. For
 
additional information regarding
 
our acquisition of
 
Echo Lake 
Foods, see

Marketing and Distribution 
In
 
fiscal
 
2025,
 
we
 
sold
 
our
 
products
 
in
 
40
 
states
 
through
 
the
 
southwestern,
 
southeastern,
 
mid-western,
 
mid-Atlantic
 
and 
northeastern regions
 
of the
 
U.S. as
 
well as
 
Puerto Rico
 
through our
 
extensive distribution
 
network to
 
a diverse
 
group of
 
customers, 
including national
 
and regional
 
grocery
 
store chains,
 
club stores,
 
companies servicing
 
independent supermarkets
 
in the
 
U.S., 
foodservice distributors and egg product consumers. Some of
 
our sales are completed through co-pack agreements –
 
a common 
practice in the industry whereby production and processing of certain products are outsourced to another producer.
 
The majority of eggs sold are based on the daily or short-term needs of our customers. Most sales to established accounts are on 
payment terms ranging
 
from seven to
 
30 days. Although
 
we have established
 
long-term relationships
 
with many
 
of our customers, 
most of them are free to acquire shell eggs from other sources. 
The shell eggs
 
we sell are
 
either delivered to
 
our customers’ warehouse
 
or retail stores,
 
by our own
 
fleet or contracted
 
refrigerated 
delivery trucks, or are picked up by our customers at our processing facilities. 
We
 
are a member of
 
the Eggland’s
 
Best, Inc. cooperative and
 
produce, market, distribute and
 
sell 
Egg-Land’s
 
Best®
 
and 
Land 
O’ Lakes®
 
branded eggs directly
 
and through our
 
joint ventures, Specialty
 
Eggs, LLC and
 
Southwest Specialty Eggs,
 
LLC, under 
exclusive
 
license
 
agreements
 
in
 
Alabama,
 
Arizona,
 
Florida,
 
Georgia,
 
Louisiana,
 
Mississippi
 
and
 
Texas,
 
and
 
in
 
portions
 
of 
Arkansas, California, Kansas, Nevada,
 
North Carolina, Oklahoma and
 
South Carolina. We also have an exclusive
 
license in New 
York City in addition to exclusivity in select
 
New York metropolitan areas, including areas within
 
New Jersey and Pennsylvania. 
As discussed above under “Branded Eggs,” we also sell our own 
Farmhouse Eggs
® and 
4-Grain
® branded eggs. 
Customers 
Our top three
 
customers accounted for
 
an aggregate of
 
49.2%, 49.0% and
 
50.1% of our
 
net sales dollars
 
for fiscal 2025,
 
2024, 
and 2023, respectively.
 
Our largest customer,
 
Walmart
 
Inc. (including Sam's Club),
 
accounted for 33.6%, 34.0%
 
and 34.2% of 
net sales dollars for fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
 
For shell
 
egg sales
 
in fiscal
 
2025, approximately
 
86% of
 
our revenue
 
related to
 
sales to
 
retail customers
 
and 13%
 
to sales
 
to 
foodservice providers. Retail customers include primarily national and regional grocery store chains, club stores, and companies 
servicing independent supermarkets in the U.S.
 
Foodservice customers include primarily companies that
 
sell food products and 
related items to restaurants, healthcare and education facilities and hotels. 








11 
Competition 
The production, processing, and distribution of shell
 
eggs is an intensely competitive business, which
 
has traditionally attracted 
large numbers of producers in the U.S.
 
Shell egg competition is generally based on price, service and
 
product quality. The shell 
egg
 
production
 
industry
 
remains
 
highly
 
fragmented.
 
According
 
to 
Egg
 
Industry
 
Magazine
,
 
the
 
ten
 
largest
 
producers
 
owned 
approximately 54% of industry table egg layer hens at calendar year-end 2024 and 2023. 
Seasonality 
Retail sales of shell eggs historically have been highest during the fall
 
and winter months and lowest during the summer months. 
Prices for shell eggs fluctuate in response to seasonal demand
 
factors and a natural increase in egg production during the
 
spring 
and early summer.
 
Historically, shell
 
egg prices tend to increase
 
with the start of the
 
school year and tend to
 
be highest prior to 
holiday
 
periods,
 
particularly
 
Thanksgiving,
 
Christmas
 
and
 
Easter.
 
Consequently,
 
and
 
all
 
other
 
things
 
being
 
equal,
 
we
 
would 
expect to experience lower selling
 
prices, sales volumes and net
 
income (and may incur net
 
losses) in our first and
 
fourth fiscal 
quarters ending in
 
August/September and May/June, respectively. Accordingly, we generally
 
expect our need
 
for working capital 
to be highest during those quarters. 
Growth Strategy 
Our growth
 
strategy is
 
centered on
 
both organic
 
growth and
 
growth through
 
acquisitions while
 
also diversifying
 
our product 
portfolio.
 
Organic
 
growth
 
is
 
a
 
core,
 
ongoing
 
focus
 
area
 
for
 
us
 
which
 
is
 
grounded
 
in our
 
culture of
 
operational
 
excellence to 
streamline workflows, reduce waste,
 
optimize resources and enhance
 
productivity. We are committed to investing in our existing 
operations to strive for improved profitability by increasing sales, lowering costs and maintaining exceptional customer service. 
We
 
have continued to grow our production
 
of cage-free shell eggs and other
 
higher value specialty eggs such as
 
pasture-raised, 
free-range and organic shell
 
eggs. In addition to organic
 
efforts, we believe that
 
we can continue to expand
 
the market reach of 
our shell egg and egg product businesses, as
 
well as grow our prepared foods business through
 
accretive acquisitions that deliver 
favorable returns through our operating model emphasizing synergies and efficient operations.
 
Trademarks and License Agreements 
We own the trademarks 
Farmhouse Eggs®
, 
Sunups®
, 
Sunny Meadow®
 
and 
4Grain®
. We produce and
 
market 
Egg-Land's Best
® 
and 
Land O’ Lakes
® branded eggs under license agreements with
 
EB. We
 
believe these trademarks and license agreements
 
are 
important to our business.
 
Government Regulation 
Our facilities and operations are
 
subject to regulation by various federal,
 
state, and local agencies, including, but
 
not limited to, 
the FDA,
 
USDA, Environmental
 
Protection Agency
 
(“EPA”),
 
Occupational Safety
 
and Health
 
Administration (“OSHA”)
 
and 
corresponding state agencies. The applicable regulations relate to grading, quality control, labeling, sanitary control
 
and reuse or 
disposal of waste. Our shell egg facilities are subject to
 
periodic USDA, FDA, EPA and OSHA inspections. Our feed production 
facilities are subject to FDA, EPA
 
and OSHA regulation and inspections. We maintain inspection programs and in certain cases 
utilize
 
independent
 
third-party
 
certification
 
bodies
 
to
 
monitor
 
compliance
 
with
 
regulations,
 
our
 
own
 
standards
 
and
 
customer 
specifications. It is possible that we will be required to incur significant costs for compliance with such statutes and regulations. 
In the future, additional rules could be proposed that, if adopted, could increase our costs. 
A number
 
of states
 
have passed
 
legislation or
 
regulations mandating
 
minimum space
 
or cage-free
 
requirements for
 
egg production 
or have
 
mandated the
 
sale of
 
only cage-free
 
eggs and
 
egg products in
 
their states.
 
For further
 
information refer
 
to the
 
heading 
“Specialty Eggs” within this section. 
Environmental Regulation 
Our operations and facilities are subject to various federal, state, and local environmental, health and safety
 
laws and regulations 
governing, among
 
other
 
things, the
 
generation, storage,
 
handling, use,
 
transportation, disposal,
 
and remediation
 
of
 
hazardous 
materials. Under these laws and
 
regulations, we must obtain
 
permits from governmental authorities,
 
including, but not limited to, 
wastewater discharge permits. We
 
have made, and will continue
 
to make, capital and other
 
expenditures relating to compliance 
with existing
 
environmental, health
 
and safety
 
laws and
 
regulations and
 
permits. We
 
are not
 
currently aware
 
of any
 
material 
capital expenditures necessary to comply with such laws and regulations; however, as environmental, health and safety laws and 
regulations are becoming increasingly more stringent, including those relating to
 
animal wastes and wastewater discharges, it is 
possible that we will have to incur significant costs for compliance with such laws and regulations in the future.

Human Capital Resources 
 
 
As of May
 
31, 2025, we
 
had 3,828 employees, of whom 3,064 worked
 
in egg production,
 
processing, and marketing,
 
231 worked 
in feed
 
mill operations
 
and 533, including our
 
executive officers, were
 
administrative employees. Approximately
 
3.8% of
 
our 
personnel
 
are
 
part-time, and we
 
utilize
 
temporary
 
employment
 
agencies
 
and
 
independent
 
contractors
 
to
 
augment
 
our 
staffing needs when
 
necessary.
 
For
 
fiscal
 
2025,
 
we
 
had
 
1,975
 
average monthly
 
contingent workers.
 
As
 
of
 
May
 
31,
 
2025,
 
43 
employees were covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relations with employees to be good.
 
Culture and Values
 
 
We are proud
 
to be contributing corporate citizens where we live and work and to help
 
create healthy, prosperous communities. 
Our
 
colleagues help
 
us
 
continue to
 
enhance our
 
community contributions,
 
which
 
are driven
 
by
 
our longstanding
 
culture that 
strives to promote an environment that upholds integrity and respect and provides opportunities for each colleague to
 
realize full 
potential. These commitments
 
are encapsulated in the
 
Cal-Maine Foods’
 
Code of Ethics and
 
Business Conduct
 
and in our 
Human 
Rights Statement. 
 
Health and Safety
 
 
Our top
 
priority is
 
the health
 
and safety
 
of our
 
employees, who
 
continue to
 
produce high-quality,
 
affordable products
 
for our 
customers and contribute
 
to a stable
 
food supply. Our enterprise safety
 
committee is comprised of
 
two corporate safety
 
managers, 
and
 
seven
 
local
 
site
 
compliance
 
managers.
 
The
 
committee
 
that
 
oversees health
 
and
 
safety reviews
 
our
 
written policies
 
and 
changes to OSHA regulation standards annually and shares information as it relates to
 
outcomes from incidents monthly with all 
our facilities to improve future performance and our health and safety practices. The
 
committee’s goals include working to help 
ensure that our engagements with customers and regulators evidence our strong commitment to our workers’ health and safety. 
 
Our commitment to our colleagues’ health includes a strong commitment to on-site worker safety, including a focus on accident 
prevention and life safety.
 
Our Safety and Health Program is designed to promote best practices that
 
help prevent and minimize 
workplace accidents and illnesses.
 
The scope of our Safety
 
and Health Program applies to
 
all enterprise colleagues. Additionally, 
to help
 
protect the
 
health and
 
well-being of
 
our colleagues
 
and people
 
in our
 
value chain,
 
we require
 
that any
 
contractors or 
vendors
 
acknowledge
 
and
 
agree
 
to
 
comply
 
with
 
the
 
guidelines
 
governed
 
by
 
our
 
Safety
 
and
 
Health
 
Program.
 
At
 
each
 
of
 
our 
locations, our general managers are expected to uphold and implement our Safety and Health Program in alignment with OSHA 
requirements. We
 
believe that this
 
program, which is
 
reviewed annually by
 
our senior management
 
team, contributes to
 
strong 
safety outcomes. As part
 
of our Safety and
 
Health Program, we conduct
 
multi-lingual training that
 
covers topics such
 
as slip-and-
fall avoidance, respiratory
 
protection, prevention of
 
hazardous communication of
 
chemicals, the proper
 
use of personal
 
protective 
equipment, hearing
 
conservation, emergency
 
response, lockout
 
and tagout
 
of equipment
 
and forklift
 
safety,
 
among others.
 
We 
have
 
also
 
installed dry
 
hydrogen
 
peroxide biodefense
 
systems
 
in
 
our
 
processing
 
facilities
 
to
 
help
 
protect
 
our
 
colleagues’ 
respiratory health.
 
To help drive
 
our focus
 
on colleague
 
safety, we developed
 
safety committees
 
at each
 
of our
 
sites with
 
employee 
representation from each department.
 
We
 
review the
 
success of
 
our safety
 
programs on
 
a monthly
 
basis to
 
monitor their
 
effectiveness and
 
the development
 
of any 
trends that need to be addressed.
 
 
People 
 
Our
 
strength
 
as
 
a
 
company
 
comes
 
from
 
our
 
employees
 
at
 
all
 
levels
 
and
 
we
 
have
 
a
 
long-established
 
culture
 
that
 
values
 
each 
individual’s contributions and
 
encourages productivity
 
and growth. This
 
culture is driven by
 
our Board of
 
Directors (the
 
“Board”) 
and
 
executive
 
management
 
team.
 
Our
 
Policy
 
against Harassment,
 
Discrimination,
 
Unlawful
 
or
 
Unethical
 
Conduct
 
and 
Retaliation; Reporting
 
Procedure affirms our
 
commitment to
 
supporting our
 
employees regardless
 
of race, color, religion,
 
sex, 
national origin or any other basis protected by applicable law.
 
 
We
 
are
 
an
 
Equal
 
Opportunity
 
Employer
 
that
 
prohibits
 
any
 
violation
 
of
 
applicable
 
federal,
 
state,
 
or
 
local
 
law
 
regarding 
employment. Discrimination
 
on any
 
basis protected
 
by applicable
 
law is
 
prohibited. We
 
maintain strong
 
protocols to
 
help our 
colleagues perform
 
their jobs
 
free from
 
harassment and
 
discrimination. We are committed
 
to offering our
 
colleagues opportunities 
commensurate with our operational needs and their experiences, goals and contributions.
 
 
Recruitment, Development and Retention
 
 
We
 
believe
 
in
 
compensating
 
our
 
colleagues
 
with
 
fair
 
and
 
competitive
 
wages,
 
in
 
addition
 
to
 
offering
 
competitive
 
benefits. 
Approximately 79%
 
of
 
our
 
employees
 
are paid
 
at
 
hourly
 
rates,
 
which
 
are
 
all
 
paid
 
at
 
rates
 
above
 
the
 
federal
 
minimum wage 








 


13 
requirement. We offer our full-time eligible
 
employees a range
 
of benefits, including company-paid
 
life insurance. The
 
Company 
provides
 
a
 
comprehensive
 
self-insured
 
health
 
plan
 
and
 
pays
 
approximately
 
76%
 
of
 
the
 
costs
 
of
 
the
 
plan
 
for
 
participating 
employees and their families
 
as of December 31,
 
2024. Recent benchmarking of

Sustainability 
We understand that climate, and the potential consequences of climate change, freshwater availability and preservation of global 
biodiversity, in addition
 
to responsible
 
management of
 
our flocks,
 
are vital
 
to the
 
production of
 
high-quality eggs
 
and egg
 
products 
and to the success of
 
the Company. We have engaged in
 
agricultural production
 
for more than
 
60 years. Our
 
agricultural practices 
continue to evolve as we continue to
 
strive to meet the need for nutritious, affordable foods
 
to feed a growing population even as 
we exercise responsible
 
natural resource
 
stewardship and
 
conservation. We
 
published our most
 
recent sustainability report for 
our fiscal 2024 in July 2025, which is available

ITEM 1A.
 
RISK FACTORS 
 
Our
 
business
 
and
 
results
 
of
 
operations
 
are
 
subject
 
to
 
numerous
 
risks
 
and
 
uncertainties,
 
many
 
of
 
which
 
are
 
beyond
 
our 
control. The following is a description of
 
the known factors that
 
may materially affect our
 
business, financial condition or
 
results 
of operations. They should
 
be considered
 
carefully,
 
in addition to
 
the information set
 
forth elsewhere
 
in this Annual
 
Report on 
Form
 
10-K,
 
including
 
under
 
Part
 
II.
 
Item 7.
 
Management’s
 
Discussion
 
and
 
Analysis
 
of
 
Financial
 
Condition
 
and
 
Results
 
of 
Operations,
 
in
 
making
 
any
 
investment
 
decisions
 
with
 
respect
 
to
 
our
 
securities. Additional
 
risks
 
or
 
uncertainties
 
that
 
are
 
not 
currently known
 
to us, or
 
that we are
 
aware of
 
but currently
 
deem to be
 
immaterial or that
 
could apply to
 
any company could 
also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
INDUSTRY RISK FACTORS 
Market prices of
 
wholesale shell eggs
 
are volatile,
 
and decreases
 
in these prices
 
can adversely impact
 
our revenues
 
and 
profits. 
Our operating results are significantly affected by wholesale shell egg market prices, which fluctuate widely and are outside our 
control. As a
 
result, our
 
prior performance
 
should not
 
be presumed
 
to be
 
an accurate
 
indication of
 
future performance.
 
Under 
certain circumstances,
 
small increases
 
in production,
 
or small
 
decreases in demand,
 
within the industry
 
might have a
 
large adverse 
effect on shell egg prices. Low shell egg prices adversely affect our revenues and profits. 
Market prices for wholesale shell
 
eggs have been volatile and
 
cyclical. Shell egg prices have
 
risen in the past
 
during periods of 
high demand such as the initial outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and periods when high protein diets are popular. Shell egg 
prices
 
have
 
also
 
risen
 
during
 
periods
 
of
 
constrained
 
supply,
 
such
 
as
 
during
 
outbreaks
 
of
 
highly
 
pathogenic
 
avian
 
influenza 
(“HPAI”).
 
During
 
times
 
when
 
prices
 
are
 
high,
 
the
 
egg
 
industry
 
has
 
typically
 
geared
 
up
 
to
 
produce
 
more
 
eggs,
 
primarily
 
by 








14 
increasing the number of layers, which historically has ultimately resulted in an oversupply of eggs, leading to a period of lower 
prices.
 
As discussed
 
above in 
Part I.
 
Item 1.
 
Business –
 
Seasonality
, seasonal
 
fluctuations impact
 
shell egg
 
prices. Therefore,
 
comparisons 
of
 
our
 
sales
 
and
 
operating
 
results
 
between
 
different
 
quarters
 
within
 
a
 
single
 
fiscal
 
year
 
are
 
not
 
necessarily
 
meaningful 
comparisons. 
A decline in consumer demand for shell eggs can negatively impact our business. 
We believe high-protein diet trends, industry advertising campaigns, the improved nutritional reputation of eggs and an increase 
in at-home consumption of eggs
 
during the COVID-19 pandemic, have
 
all contributed at one time
 
or another to increased shell 
egg demand. However, it is possible that the demand
 
for shell eggs will decline in the
 
future. Adverse publicity relating to health 
or safety
 
concerns and
 
changes in
 
the perception
 
of the
 
nutritional value
 
of shell
 
eggs, changes
 
in consumer
 
views regarding 
consumption of animal-based
 
products, as well
 
as movement
 
away from high
 
protein diets,
 
could adversely
 
affect demand
 
for 
shell eggs, which could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition. 
Feed costs are volatile and increases in these costs can adversely impact our results of operations. 
Feed costs are the
 
largest element of our
 
shell egg (farm) production
 
cost, ranging from 53%
 
to 63% of total
 
farm production cost 
in the last five fiscal years.
 
Although feed ingredients,
 
primarily corn and soybean
 
meal, are available
 
from a number
 
of sources, we
 
do not have control
 
over 
the prices
 
of the
 
ingredients we
 
purchase, which
 
are affected
 
by weather,
 
various global
 
and U.S.
 
supply and
 
demand factors, 
transportation and
 
storage costs,
 
speculators, agricultural,
 
energy and
 
trade policies
 
in the
 
U.S. and
 
internationally,
 
and global 
instability, including as
 
a result of the war in Ukraine,
 
the conflicts involving Israel and Iran and
 
attacks on shipping in the Red 
Sea. For example, while
 
feed costs declined during
 
fiscal 2025, we saw
 
higher prices for corn
 
and soybean meal over
 
the last five 
fiscal years as a
 
result of weather-related
 
shortfalls in production and
 
yields, ongoing supply chain
 
disruptions, and the Russia-
Ukraine war and its impact on the export markets. Our costs for corn and soybean meal are also affected by local basis prices.
 
Increases in feed costs unaccompanied by increases in
 
the selling price of eggs can have a
 
material adverse effect on the results 
of our operations and
 
cash flow. Alternatively,
 
low feed costs can
 
encourage egg industry overproduction, possibly
 
resulting in 
lower egg prices and lower revenue.
 
Agricultural risks, including
 
outbreaks of avian
 
diseases such as
 
HPAI,
 
have harmed and
 
in the future
 
could harm our 
business.
 
Our shell egg production activities
 
are subject to a variety
 
of agricultural risks. Unusual or
 
extreme weather conditions, disease 
and pests can materially and
 
adversely affect the quality and quantity
 
of shell eggs we produce
 
and distribute. Outbreaks of avian 
influenza among poultry occur periodically worldwide and have occurred sporadically in the U.S. Recent HPAI outbreaks in the 
U.S. caused
 
significant depopulation
 
of U.S.
 
commercial table
 
egg layer
 
flocks, lower
 
shell egg
 
supplies and
 
higher shell
 
egg 
prices. During the third
 
and fourth quarters of
 
fiscal 2024, we experienced
 
HPAI outbreaks within our facilities located in
 
Kansas 
and Texas,
 
which are now
 
fully operational. For
 
additional information, refer
 
to 
Part II. Item
 
7. Management’s
 
Discussion and 
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – HPAI
.
We
 
maintain controls
 
and procedures
 
designed to
 
reduce the
 
risk of
 
exposing our
 
flocks and
 
employees to
 
harmful diseases; 
however, despite
 
these efforts, outbreaks
 
of avian diseases
 
can and do
 
still occur and
 
have adversely impacted,
 
and may in
 
the 
future adversely impact, the health
 
of our flocks and could in the
 
future adversely impact the health
 
of our employees. Continued 
or intensified spread of
 
HPAI could have a material adverse impact on
 
our financial results by
 
increasing government restrictions 
on the sale and distribution of
 
our products and requiring us to
 
euthanize the affected layers. Negative publicity
 
from outbreaks 
within our industry can
 
negatively impact customer perception. If
 
a substantial portion of
 
our layers or production
 
facilities
 
are 
affected by any of these factors in any given quarter or year, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be 
materially and adversely affected. 
Shell
 
eggs
 
and
 
shell
 
egg
 
products
 
are
 
susceptible to
 
microbial
 
contamination, and
 
we
 
may
 
be
 
required
 
to,
 
or
 
we
 
may 
voluntarily, recall contaminated products. 
Shell eggs
 
and shell
 
egg products
 
are vulnerable
 
to contamination by
 
pathogens such
 
as Salmonella
 
Enteritidis. The Company 
maintains policies and procedures designed to comply with the complex
 
rules and regulations governing egg production, such as 
The Final
 
Egg Rule
 
issued by
 
the FDA
 
“Prevention of
 
Salmonella Enteritidis
 
in Shell
 
Eggs During
 
Production, Storage,
 
and 
Transportation,” and the FDA’s
 
Food Safety Modernization Act. Shipment of contaminated products, even if inadvertent, could 








15 
result in a
 
violation of law
 
and lead to
 
increased risk
 
of exposure to
 
product liability
 
claims, product
 
recalls and scrutiny
 
by federal 
and
 
state
 
regulatory
 
agencies.
 
We
 
have
 
little,
 
if
 
any,
 
control
 
over
 
proper
 
handling
 
once
 
the
 
product
 
has
 
been
 
shipped
 
or 
delivered. In
 
addition,
 
products
 
purchased
 
from
 
other
 
producers
 
could
 
contain
 
contaminants
 
that
 
might
 
be
 
inadvertently 
redistributed by us. This has occurred in the past and we were
 
required to recall eggs redistributed to our customers. As such, we 
might decide
 
or be
 
required to
 
recall a
 
product if
 
we, our
 
customers or
 
regulators believe
 
it poses
 
a potential
 
health risk. Any 
product recall
 
could result
 
in a
 
loss of
 
consumer confidence
 
in our
 
products, adversely
 
affect our
 
reputation with
 
existing and 
potential customers and
 
have a material
 
adverse effect on
 
our business, results
 
of operations and
 
financial condition. We currently 
maintain insurance
 
with respect
 
to certain
 
of these
 
risks, including
 
product liability
 
insurance, business
 
interruption insurance, 
product recall insurance and general liability insurance, but in many cases such insurance is
 
expensive, difficult to obtain and no 
assurance can be
 
given that such
 
insurance can be
 
maintained in the
 
future on acceptable
 
terms, or in
 
sufficient amounts to
 
protect 
us against losses
 
due to any such events, or at all. 
Our
 
profitability
 
may
 
be
 
adversely
 
impacted
 
by
 
increases
 
in
 
other
 
input
 
costs
 
such
 
as
 
packaging
 
materials,
 
delivery 
expenses, construction materials and equipment, including as a result of inflation and tariffs.
In addition to feed ingredient costs, other significant input costs include costs
 
of packaging materials and delivery expenses. Our 
costs of
 
packing materials
 
increased during
 
the past
 
three fiscal
 
years due
 
to inflation
 
and higher
 
labor costs,
 
and during
 
2022 
also as a
 
result of supply
 
chain constraints initially caused
 
by the pandemic,
 
and these costs
 
may continue to increase.
 
We
 
also 
experienced increases in delivery expenses during fiscal 2023 and 2022 due to increases in fuel and labor costs for
 
both our fleet 
and contract trucking, and these
 
costs may continue to increase.
 
Changes in U.S. trade and
 
tariffs policies may cause higher costs 
for construction materials, equipment, packaging and other
 
items. Increases in these costs are
 
largely outside of our control
 
and 
could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and cash flow. 
BUSINESS AND OPERATIONAL RISK FACTORS 
Our acquisition growth strategy subjects us to various risks. 
As discussed in 
Part I. Item I. Business – Growth Strategy
, we plan to continue to pursue a growth strategy that includes,
 
in part, 
selective acquisitions
 
of
 
other
 
businesses engaged
 
in
 
the production
 
and sale
 
of
 
shell
 
eggs, with
 
a priority
 
on
 
those that
 
will 
facilitate our ability
 
to expand our
 
cage-free shell egg
 
production capabilities
 
in key locations
 
and markets.
 
We may over-estimate 
or under-estimate the
 
demand for cage-free
 
eggs, which could
 
cause our acquisition
 
strategy to be
 
less-than-optimal for our
 
future 
growth and profitability.
 
The number of existing businesses with
 
cage-free capacity that we may
 
be able to purchase is
 
limited, 
as
 
most
 
production
 
of
 
shell
 
eggs
 
by
 
other
 
companies
 
in
 
our
 
markets
 
currently
 
does
 
not
 
meet
 
customer
 
demands
 
or
 
legal 
requirements to be designated as cage-free. Conversely, if we acquire cage-free production capacity, which is more expensive to 
purchase
 
and
 
operate,
 
and
 
customer
 
demands
 
or
 
legal
 
requirements
 
for
 
cage-free
 
eggs
 
were
 
to
 
change,
 
the
 
resulting
 
lack
 
of 
demand for cage-free eggs may result in higher costs and lower profitability. 
Acquisitions require capital resources and
 
can divert management’s attention from our existing
 
business. Acquisitions also entail 
an inherent risk that
 
we could become
 
subject to contingent
 
or other liabilities,
 
including liabilities arising
 
from events or
 
conduct 
prior to
 
our acquisition
 
of a
 
business that
 
were unknown
 
to us
 
at the
 
time of
 
acquisition. We
 
could incur
 
significantly greater 
expenditures in integrating an acquired business than we anticipated at the time of its purchase. 
We cannot assure you that we: 
●
will identify suitable acquisition candidates; 
●
can consummate acquisitions on acceptable terms; 
●
can successfully integrate an acquired business into our operations; or 
●
can successfully manage the operations of an acquired business. 
No
 
assurance can
 
be
 
given
 
that
 
businesses
 
we
 
acquire
 
in
 
the
 
future
 
will
 
contribute
 
positively
 
to
 
our
 
results
 
of
 
operations
 
or 
financial condition.
 
In addition,
 
federal antitrust
 
laws require
 
regulatory approval
 
of acquisitions
 
that exceed
 
certain threshold 
levels of significance, and we cannot guarantee that such approvals would be obtained. 
The consideration we pay
 
in connection with any
 
acquisition affects our financial
 
results. If we pay
 
cash, we could be
 
required 
to
 
use
 
a
 
portion
 
of
 
our
 
available cash
 
or
 
credit
 
facility
 
to
 
consummate
 
the
 
acquisition.
 
To
 
the
 
extent
 
we
 
issue
 
shares
 
of
 
our 
Common Stock, existing
 
stockholders may be
 
diluted. In addition,
 
acquisitions may result
 
in additional debt.
 
Our ability to
 
access 
any additional capital
 
that may
 
be needed
 
for an
 
acquisition may be
 
adversely impacted by
 
higher interest rates
 
and economic 
uncertainty. 








 


16 
We
 
may
 
not
 
realize
 
the
 
anticipated
 
benefits
 
of
 
our
 
acquisition
 
of
 
Echo
 
Lake
 
Foods
 
and
 
our
 
strategy
 
to
 
diversify
 
our 
product mix to include more prepared foods. 
As discussed
 
elsewhere in
 
this report,
 
we completed
 
our acquisition
 
of Echo
 
Lake Foods
 
on June
 
2, 2025.
 
Although we
 
had 
already diversified our business
 
with some prepared foods
 
product offerings, the
 
acquisition of Echo Lake
 
Foods represented a 
significant expansion of
 
this strategy.
 
Accordingly, we
 
may experience unexpected
 
challenges in integrating
 
and managing the 
business of
 
Echo Lake
 
Foods. Integrating
 
Echo Lake
 
Foods’ business
 
may be
 
more costly
 
or time
 
consuming than
 
we expect. 
Even if
 
the business
 
of Echo
 
Lake Foods
 
is successfully
 
integrated, we
 
may not
 
realize the
 
benefits we
 
expect from
 
the acquisition, 
including the
 
synergies, cost
 
savings, reduction
 
in earnings
 
volatility,
 
margin expansion,
 
financial returns,
 
expanded customer 
relationships, or sales
 
or growth opportunities.
 
Our experience managing
 
prepared foods businesses
 
is much more
 
limited than 
our experience managing
 
our shell egg
 
and egg products
 
businesses, and our
 
strategy to diversity
 
our product mix
 
to include more 
prepared foods may not produce the
 
favorable financial and other results
 
that we anticipate. For additional information
 
regarding 
our
 
acquisition of
 
Echo Lake
 
Foods, see

Subsequent 
Events
.
Global or
 
regional
 
health crises
 
including pandemics
 
or epidemics
 
could have
 
an adverse
 
impact on
 
our business
 
and 
operations. 
The
 
effects
 
of
 
global
 
or
 
regional
 
pandemics
 
or
 
epidemics can
 
significantly
 
impact
 
our
 
operations.
 
Although
 
demand
 
for
 
our 
products could
 
increase as
 
a result
 
of restrictions
 
such as
 
travel bans
 
and restrictions,
 
quarantines, shelter-in-place
 
orders, and 
business and government
 
shutdowns, which can
 
prompt more consumers
 
to eat at
 
home, these restrictions
 
could also significantly 
increase our cost of doing
 
business due to labor shortages,
 
supply-chain disruptions, increased costs
 
and decreased availability of 
packaging supplies or feed, and
 
increased medical and other costs.
 
We
 
experienced these impacts as a
 
result of the COVID-19 
pandemic,
 
primarily
 
during
 
our
 
fiscal
 
years
 
2020
 
and
 
2021.
 
The
 
pandemic
 
recovery
 
also
 
contributed
 
to
 
higher
 
inflation
 
and 
interest
 
rates,
 
which
 
persist
 
and
 
may
 
continue
 
to
 
persist.
 
The
 
impacts
 
of
 
health
 
crises
 
are
 
difficult
 
to
 
predict
 
and
 
depend
 
on 
numerous factors
 
including the severity,
 
length and
 
geographic scope of
 
the outbreak, resurgences
 
of the
 
disease and
 
variants, 
availability and
 
acceptance of
 
vaccines, and
 
governmental, business
 
and individuals’
 
responses.
 
A resurgence
 
of COVID-19 
and/or variants, or any future major
 
public health crisis, would disrupt our
 
business and could have a material adverse
 
effect on 
our financial results. 
Our largest customers have accounted
 
for a significant portion of
 
our net sales volume. Accordingly, our business
 
may be 
adversely affected by the loss of, reduced purchases by, or pricing pressure from, one or more
 
of our large customers. 
Our customers, such as supermarkets, warehouse clubs and food distributors, have continued to consolidate and consolidation is 
expected to continue.
 
These consolidations have
 
produced larger customers and
 
potential customers with
 
increased buying power 
that are more
 
capable of operating with
 
reduced inventories, opposing price
 
increases, and demanding lower
 
pricing, increased 
promotional programs and specifically
 
tailored products. Because of
 
these trends, our volume
 
growth could slow or
 
we may need 
to lower prices or increase promotional spending for our products, any of which could adversely affect our financial results.
 
Our top three customers
 
accounted for an aggregate
 
of 49.2%, 49.0% and
 
50.1% of our net
 
sales dollars for fiscal
 
2025, 2024 and 
2023, respectively.
 
Our largest
 
customer, Walmart
 
Inc. (including Sam's
 
Club), accounted for
 
33.6%, 34.0% and
 
34.2% of net 
sales dollars for fiscal
 
2025, 2024 and 2023,
 
respectively. Although we have established long-term
 
relationships with most of
 
our 
customers who continue to
 
purchase from us based
 
on our ability to
 
service their needs, they
 
are generally free to
 
acquire shell 
eggs from other
 
sources. If, for any
 
reason, one or
 
more of our
 
large customers were
 
to purchase significantly
 
less of our
 
shell 
eggs in the future, terminate their
 
purchases from us or demand significantly
 
lower pricing, and we were not
 
able to sell our shell 
eggs to
 
new customers
 
at comparable
 
levels, it
 
would have
 
a material
 
adverse effect
 
on our
 
business, financial
 
condition, and 
results of operations. 
The recent high market prices
 
for eggs, primarily caused by the
 
HPAI-related
 
reduction in supply,
 
led to pressure from 
customers to
 
change long-standing
 
market-based pricing
 
frameworks and/or
 
otherwise reduce
 
the price
 
of our
 
eggs. A 
material change in
 
our sales arrangements
 
with key customers
 
could have a
 
material adverse effect
 
on our revenues,
 
gross 
profits and
 
net income. Other
 
reactions to
 
high egg prices,
 
including by state
 
or federal government
 
agencies, may also 
adversely impact our business. 
Market prices for wholesale shell eggs have been volatile
 
and cyclical over time. Market prices for eggs
 
tend to increase during 
and following outbreaks of
 
agricultural diseases in the
 
egg industry that reduce
 
the supply of eggs,
 
which has occurred during
 
the 
current
 
HPAI
 
outbreak,
 
until
 
the
 
supply
 
and
 
demand
 
balance
 
is
 
restored.
 
Many
 
of
 
our
 
sales
 
arrangements
 
with
 
customers, 
particularly for conventional eggs, are based on formulas that take into account, in varying ways, independently quoted regional 
wholesale
 
market
 
prices
 
for
 
eggs.
 
The
 
recent
 
high
 
market
 
prices
 
for
 
eggs
 
have
 
led
 
to
 
pressure
 
from
 
customers
 
to
 
change 








17 
longstanding market-based pricing frameworks and/or otherwise reduce the price of our
 
eggs. To remain competitive
 
and retain 
our
 
customers
 
and
 
gain
 
new
 
ones,
 
we
 
must
 
consider
 
our
 
customer
 
relationships
 
and
 
the
 
reactions
 
and
 
potential
 
reactions
 
of 
competitors. A
 
material change
 
in our
 
sales arrangements
 
with key
 
customers could
 
have a
 
material adverse
 
effect on our
 
revenues 
and gross profits. 
Other
 
reactions
 
to
 
high
 
egg
 
prices
 
may
 
also
 
adversely
 
impact
 
our
 
business.
 
On
 
February
 
26,
 
2025,
 
the
 
U.S.
 
Secretary
 
of 
Agriculture announced a
 
$1 billion comprehensive
 
strategy to curb
 
HPAI, protect the U.S. poultry industry, and lower
 
egg prices. 
The Secretary’s
 
five-pronged strategy
 
includes an
 
additional $500
 
million for
 
biosecurity measures,
 
$400 million
 
in financial 
relief for affected farmers, and $100 million for vaccine research, actions to reduce regulatory burdens, and exploring temporary 
egg import options.
 
In March 2025,
 
we received a
 
civil investigative demand
 
in connection with
 
a widely publicized
 
investigation 
by the
 
Antitrust Division
 
of the
 
Department of
 
Justice (“DOJ”)
 
into the
 
causes behind
 
nationwide increases
 
in egg
 
prices. In 
addition,
 
persistent
 
high
 
egg
 
prices
 
may
 
cause
 
some
 
consumers
 
to
 
purchase
 
fewer
 
eggs.
 
Persistent high-price
 
cycles
 
and
 
the 
existence of the
 
DOJ investigation may
 
also increase attention
 
on the egg
 
industry,
 
and the Company
 
specifically, by
 
state and 
federal government agencies, which may lead
 
to additional government investigations or
 
related activities. The potential impacts 
of these reactions on our
 
business are unclear,
 
unpredictable and may divert our
 
resources and attention from our
 
core business 
activities, and they may have an adverse effect that could be material.
 
Our business is highly competitive. 
The production and sale of fresh shell eggs, which accounted for 94.3% to 95.3% of our net sales in our last three fiscal years, is 
intensely competitive.
 
We
 
compete with
 
a large
 
number of
 
competitors that
 
may prove
 
to be
 
more successful
 
than we
 
are in 
producing, marketing and selling shell eggs. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to compete successfully with any 
or all of these companies. Increased competition could result in price reductions, greater
 
cyclicality, reduced margins and loss of 
market share, which would negatively affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. In
 
addition, our growth 
strategy
 
includes
 
expansion
 
of
 
our
 
product
 
offerings
 
including
 
prepared
 
foods.
 
The
 
prepared
 
foods
 
business
 
is
 
intensely 
competitive and includes
 
competition from
 
other prepared food
 
companies and
 
other suppliers of
 
prepared and convenience
 
foods 
including
 
restaurants,
 
grocery
 
stores
 
and
 
convenience
 
stores,
 
many
 
of
 
which
 
have
 
more
 
experience
 
operating
 
prepared
 
and 
convenience foods businesses. 
We
 
are
 
dependent
 
on
 
our
 
management
 
team,
 
and
 
the
 
loss
 
of
 
any
 
key
 
member
 
of
 
this
 
team
 
may
 
adversely
 
affect
 
the 
implementation of our business plan in a timely manner. 
Our success depends
 
largely upon
 
the continued service
 
of our senior
 
management team. The
 
loss or interruption
 
of service of 
one or more of
 
our key executive officers
 
could adversely affect our
 
ability to manage our
 
operations effectively and/or pursue 
our growth strategy.
 
We
 
have not entered into
 
any employment or non-compete
 
agreements with any of
 
our executive officers. 
Competition could cause us to lose talented employees, and unplanned turnover could deplete institutional knowledge and result 
in increased costs due to increased competition for employees.
 
Our
 
business
 
is
 
dependent
 
on
 
our
 
information
 
technology
 
systems
 
and
 
software,
 
and
 
failure
 
to
 
protect
 
against
 
or 
effectively respond to cyber-attacks, security
 
breaches, or other incidents involving those systems, could adversely affect 
day-to-day operations and decision making processes and have an adverse effect on our performance and reputation. 
The efficient operation of our business depends on our information technology systems, which we rely on to effectively manage 
our
 
business
 
data,
 
communications,
 
logistics,
 
accounting,
 
regulatory
 
and
 
other
 
business
 
processes.
 
If
 
we
 
do
 
not
 
allocate
 
and 
effectively manage the resources necessary
 
to build and sustain an
 
appropriate technology environment, our
 
business, reputation, 
or financial results could be negatively impacted. In addition, our information technology systems may be vulnerable to damage 
or
 
interruption
 
from
 
circumstances
 
beyond
 
our
 
control,
 
including
 
systems
 
failures,
 
natural
 
disasters,
 
terrorist
 
attacks, 
viruses, ransomware, security breaches or cyber incidents. Cyber-attacks are becoming more sophisticated and
 
are increasing in 
the number of attempts and frequency by groups and individuals with a wide range of motives. We have experienced and expect 
to continue to experience attempted cyber-attacks of our information technology systems or networks.
 
We regularly engage
 
with third-party
 
service providers
 
as part
 
of our
 
operations to
 
provide a
 
high level
 
of service
 
to our
 
customers. 
We have implemented certain practices and policies to minimize the potential risks associated with the exchange of
 
information 
with contracted vendors.
 
Despite these practices
 
and policies, we
 
cannot guarantee that
 
information technology systems
 
of our 
third-party service
 
providers will
 
prevent and
 
detect all
 
cybersecurity breaches
 
and incidents.
 
Although we
 
require third-party 
service providers to
 
notify us upon
 
a potential breach
 
or incident, there
 
is a potential
 
risk that our
 
business, reputation, or
 
financial 
results could be negatively impacted by cybersecurity incidents at their businesses. 
Additionally, future or past
 
business transactions
 
(such as acquisitions
 
or integrations) could
 
expose us
 
to additional cybersecurity 
risks and vulnerabilities, as our systems could be negatively affected by vulnerabilities present in acquired or integrated systems 








18 
and technologies.
 
Furthermore, we
 
may discover
 
security issues
 
that were
 
not found
 
during due
 
diligence of
 
such acquired
 
or 
integrated businesses, and
 
it may be
 
difficult to
 
integrate businesses into
 
our information technology
 
environment and security 
program. 
Our information technology systems also subject us to numerous data privacy obligations. We may at times fail (or be perceived 
to have failed) in our
 
efforts to comply with our
 
data privacy obligations. If we or
 
the third parties on which we
 
rely fail, or are 
perceived to have failed, to address or comply with applicable data privacy obligations, we could face significant consequences, 
including but
 
not limited
 
to government
 
enforcement actions
 
and litigation.
 
A security breach of
 
sensitive information
 
could result 
in damage to
 
our reputation and our
 
relations with our customers
 
or employees. Any
 
such damage or interruption
 
could have a 
material adverse effect on our business.
 
Technology
 
and related
 
business and
 
regulatory requirements
 
continue to
 
change rapidly.
 
Failure to
 
update or
 
replace legacy 
systems
 
to
 
address
 
these
 
changes
 
could
 
result
 
in
 
increased
 
costs,
 
including
 
remediation
 
costs,
 
system
 
downtime,
 
third
 
party 
litigation, regulatory actions or cyber security vulnerabilities which could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
Labor shortages or increases in labor costs could adversely impact our business and results of operations. 
Our
 
success
 
is
 
dependent
 
upon
 
recruiting,
 
motivating,
 
and
 
retaining
 
staff
 
to
 
operate
 
our
 
farms.
 
Approximately
 
79%
 
of
 
our 
employees are
 
paid at
 
hourly rates,
 
often in
 
entry-level positions.
 
While all
 
our employees
 
are paid
 
at rates
 
above the
 
federal 
minimum wage requirements, any significant increase
 
in local, state or federal
 
minimum wage requirements could increase our 
labor costs. In
 
addition, any regulatory
 
changes requiring us to
 
provide additional employee benefits
 
or mandating increases
 
in 
other employee-related costs, such
 
as unemployment insurance or
 
workers compensation, would increase our
 
costs. A shortage 
in
 
the
 
labor
 
pool,
 
which
 
may
 
be
 
caused
 
by
 
competition
 
from
 
other
 
employers,
 
the
 
remote
 
locations
 
of
 
many
 
of
 
our
 
farms, 
decreased labor
 
participation rates
 
or changes
 
in government-provided
 
support or
 
immigration laws
 
or policies,
 
particularly in 
times of lower unemployment, could adversely affect
 
our business and results of operations. A
 
shortage of labor available to us 
could cause our farms to operate with
 
reduced staff, which could negatively impact
 
our production capacity and efficiencies. In 
fiscal 2022, our
 
labor costs increased
 
primarily due to
 
the COVID-19 pandemic
 
and its effects,
 
which caused us
 
to increase wages 
in response to
 
labor shortages.
 
In fiscal 2024
 
and 2025, labor
 
wages continued to
 
rise due to
 
inflation and low
 
unemployment. 
Accordingly, any significant labor shortages or increases in our labor costs could have a material adverse effect on our results of 
operations. 
LEGAL AND REGULATORY
 
RISK FACTORS 
Pressure from animal rights groups regarding the treatment
 
of animals may subject
 
us to additional costs to
 
conform our 
practices
 
to
 
comply
 
with
 
developing
 
standards
 
or
 
subject
 
us
 
to
 
marketing
 
costs
 
to
 
defend
 
challenges
 
to
 
our
 
current 
practices and protect our image with our customers. In particular,
 
changes in customer preferences and state legislation 
have accelerated an increase in demand for cage-free eggs, which increases uncertainty in our business
 
and increases our 
costs. 
We and many of our customers face
 
pressure from animal rights
 
groups, such as People
 
for the Ethical Treatment of
 
Animals and 
the Humane Society of the United States, to require companies that supply food products
 
to operate their businesses in a manner 
that
 
treats
 
animals
 
in
 
conformity
 
with
 
certain
 
standards
 
developed
 
or
 
approved
 
by
 
these
 
groups.
 
In
 
general,
 
we
 
may
 
incur 
additional costs to conform
 
our practices to address
 
these standards or to
 
defend our existing practices
 
and protect our image
 
with 
our customers. The
 
standards promoted by
 
these groups change
 
over time, but
 
typically require minimum
 
cage space for
 
hens, 
among other requirements, and some of these groups have led successful legislative efforts to
 
ban any form of caged housing in 
various states.
 
As
 
discussed
 
in 
Part
 
I.
 
Item
 
1.
 
Business
 
-
 
Government
 
Regulation
,
 
ten
 
states
 
have
 
passed
 
minimum
 
space
 
and/or
 
cage-free 
requirements for
 
hens, and
 
other states
 
are considering
 
such requirements.
 
In addition,
 
a significant
 
number of
 
our customers 
have announced goals to either exclusively offer cage-free eggs or significantly increase the
 
volume of cage-free egg sales in the 
future, subject in most cases to availability of
 
supply, affordability and consumer demand, among other contingencies. While we 
anticipate that
 
our retail
 
and foodservice
 
customers will
 
continue to transition
 
to selling
 
cage-free eggs
 
given publicly
 
stated goals, 
there is
 
no assurance
 
that this
 
transition will
 
take place
 
or take
 
place according
 
to the
 
timeline of
 
current cage-free
 
goals. For 
example, customers may accelerate their transition to
 
stocking cage-free eggs, which may challenge
 
our ability to meet the cage-
free volume needs
 
of those customers
 
and result in
 
a loss of
 
shell egg sales.
 
Similarly,
 
customers who commit
 
to stock greater 
proportional quantities of cage-free eggs
 
are under no obligation to
 
continue to do so, which
 
may result in an oversupply
 
of cage-
free eggs and
 
result in lower
 
specialty egg prices,
 
which could reduce
 
the return on
 
our capital investment
 
in cage-free production. 
In
 
addition, on
 
July
 
9,
 
2025, the
 
DOJ filed
 
a
 
lawsuit
 
against the
 
State of
 
California alleging
 
that
 
California’s
 
cage-free laws 
“impose burdensome red tape on the production of eggs and poultry products nationally in
 
violation of the Supremacy Clause of 








19 
the U.S. Constitution” and lead to higher egg prices for U.S. consumers.
 
The outcome of this litigation could further complicate 
and the cage-free egg landscape and affect our ability to successfully navigate these issues. 
Changing
 
our
 
infrastructure
 
and
 
operating
 
procedures
 
to
 
conform
 
to
 
consumer
 
preferences,
 
customer
 
demands,
 
laws
 
and 
challenges to these
 
laws. has resulted
 
and will continue
 
to result in
 
additional costs, including
 
capital and operating
 
cost increases. 
The USDA reported that the estimated U.S. cage-free flock was 129.2 million hens as of May 31, 2025, which
 
is approximately 
44.9% of the total U.S. table egg layer hen population. According to the USDA Agricultural Marketing Service, as of December 
2024
 
approximately
 
221.4
 
million
 
hens,
 
or
 
about
 
73%
 
of
 
the
 
U.S.
 
non-organic
 
laying
 
flock
 
would
 
have
 
to
 
be
 
in
 
cage-free 
production to meet projected cage-free commitments from the retailers, foodservice providers and food manufacturers that have 
stated goals to transition to cage-free eggs.
 
In response
 
to our
 
customers’ announced goals
 
and increased
 
legal requirements for
 
cage-free eggs, we
 
have increased
 
capital 
expenditures
 
to
 
increase
 
our
 
cage-free
 
production
 
capacity.
 
We
 
are
 
also
 
enhancing
 
our
 
focus
 
on
 
cage-free
 
capacity
 
when 
considering acquisition
 
opportunities. Our
 
customers typically
 
do not
 
commit to
 
long-term purchases
 
of specific
 
quantities or 
type of eggs with
 
us, and as a
 
result, we cannot predict
 
with any certainty which
 
types of eggs they
 
will require us to
 
supply in 
future
 
periods.
 
The
 
production
 
of
 
cage-free
 
eggs
 
is
 
more
 
costly
 
than
 
the
 
production
 
of
 
conventional
 
eggs,
 
and
 
these
 
higher 
production costs contribute to the
 
prices of cage-free eggs,
 
which historically have typically
 
been higher than conventional
 
egg 
prices. Many
 
consumers prefer
 
to buy
 
less expensive
 
conventional shell
 
eggs. These
 
consumer preferences,
 
in addition
 
to the 
regulatory
 
landscape,
 
may
 
in
 
turn
 
influence
 
our
 
customers’
 
future
 
needs
 
for
 
cage-free
 
and
 
conventional
 
eggs.
 
Due
 
to
 
these 
uncertainties, we may over-estimate future demand for cage-free eggs, which could increase our costs unnecessarily,
 
or we may 
under-estimate future demand for
 
cage-free eggs, which could harm
 
us competitively.
 
If our competitors obtain non-cancelable 
long-term contracts to provide cage-free
 
eggs to our existing or
 
potential customers, then there may
 
be decreased demand for our 
cage-free
 
eggs
 
due
 
to
 
these
 
lost
 
potential
 
sales.
 
If
 
we
 
and
 
our
 
competitors increase
 
cage-free
 
egg production
 
and
 
there is
 
no 
commensurate increase in
 
demand for cage-free
 
eggs, this overproduction
 
could lead to
 
an oversupply of
 
cage-free eggs, reducing 
the sales price for specialty eggs and our return on capital investments in cage-free production. 
Failure
 
to
 
comply
 
with
 
applicable
 
governmental
 
regulations,
 
including
 
environmental
 
regulations,
 
could
 
harm
 
our 
operating results,
 
financial condition,
 
and reputation. Further,
 
we may
 
incur significant
 
costs to
 
comply with
 
any such 
regulations. 
We are subject to federal,
 
state and local
 
regulations relating to
 
grading, quality control,
 
labeling, sanitary control,
 
waste disposal, 
and other
 
areas of
 
our business.
 
As a
 
fully-integrated shell
 
egg producer,
 
our shell
 
egg facilities
 
are subject
 
to regulation
 
and 
inspection by the USDA, OSHA, EPA and FDA, as well as state and local health and agricultural agencies, among others. All of 
our shell egg production
 
and feed mill
 
facilities are subject
 
to FDA, EPA and OSHA regulation
 
and inspections. In
 
addition, rules 
are often proposed that, if adopted as proposed, could increase our costs.
 
Our operations and facilities are subject to various federal, state and local environmental, health, and safety
 
laws and regulations 
governing, among
 
other
 
things, the
 
generation, storage,
 
handling, use,
 
transportation, disposal,
 
and remediation
 
of
 
hazardous 
materials. Under these laws and regulations, we are required to obtain permits from governmental authorities, including, but not 
limited to wastewater discharge permits and manure and litter land applications. 
If we
 
fail to
 
comply with
 
applicable laws or
 
regulations, or fail
 
to obtain necessary
 
permits, we could
 
be subject
 
to significant 
fines and penalties or other sanctions, our reputation could be harmed, and our
 
operating results and financial condition could be 
materially adversely
 
affected.
 
In addition,
 
because these
 
laws and
 
regulations are
 
becoming increasingly
 
more stringent,
 
it is 
possible that we will be required to incur significant costs for compliance with such laws and regulations in the future. 
Climate change and legal or regulatory responses may have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.
 
Extreme weather
 
events, such
 
as derechos,
 
wildfires, drought,
 
tornadoes, hurricanes,
 
storms, floods
 
or other
 
natural disasters 
could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. In fact, derechos, fires, floods, tornadoes and 
hurricanes have affected our facilities or the facilities of other egg producers in the past. Increased
 
global temperatures and more 
frequent occurrences
 
of extreme
 
weather events,
 
which may
 
be exacerbated
 
by climate
 
change, may
 
cause crop
 
and livestock 
areas to
 
become unsuitable,
 
including due
 
to water
 
scarcity or
 
high or
 
unpredictable temperatures,
 
which may
 
result in
 
much 
greater stress on food systems and more pronounced food insecurity globally. Lower global crop production, including corn and 
soybean meal, which
 
are the primary
 
feed ingredients that
 
support the health
 
of our animals,
 
may result in
 
significantly higher 
prices for these commodity inputs, impact
 
our ability to source the commodities
 
we use to feed our flocks, and
 
negatively impact 
our ability to
 
maintain or grow
 
our operations. Climate
 
change may increasingly
 
expose workers and
 
animals to high
 
heat and 
humidity
 
stressors
 
that
 
adversely
 
impact
 
poultry
 
production
 
and
 
our
 
costs.
 
Increased
 
greenhouse
 
gas
 
emissions
 
may
 
also 
negatively impact air quality, soil quality and water quality, which may hamper
 
our ability to support our operations,
 
particularly 
in higher water- and soil-stressed regions.
 








 


20 
Increasing frequency
 
of severe
 
weather events,
 
whether tied
 
to climate
 
change or
 
any other
 
cause, may
 
negatively impact
 
our 
ability to
 
raise poultry
 
and produce
 
eggs profitably
 
or to
 
operate our
 
transportation and
 
logistics supply
 
chains. Regulatory
 
controls 
and market
 
pricing may
 
continue to
 
drive the
 
costs of
 
fossil-based fuels
 
higher,
 
which could
 
negatively impact
 
our ability
 
to 
source commodities necessary
 
to operate
 
our farms or
 
plants and
 
our current
 
fleet of
 
vehicles. These
 
changes may
 
cause us
 
to 
change, significantly, our day-to-day business operations and our strategy. Climate change and extreme weather events
 
may also 
impact demand for
 
our products given
 
evolution of consumer
 
food preferences. Even
 
if we take
 
measures to position
 
our business 
in anticipation
 
of such
 
changes, future
 
compliance with
 
legal or
 
regulatory requirements
 
may require
 
significant management 
time, oversight and enterprise expense. We may also incur significant expense tied to regulatory fines if laws and regulations are 
interpreted and applied in a manner
 
that is inconsistent with our business practices.
 
We
 
can make no assurances that our
 
efforts 
to prepare
 
for these
 
adverse events
 
will be
 
in line
 
with future
 
market and
 
regulatory expectations
 
and our
 
access to
 
capital to 
support our business may also be adversely impacted. 
Current and
 
future
 
litigation and
 
other legal
 
matters could
 
expose us
 
to significant
 
liabilities and
 
adversely affect
 
our 
business reputation. 
We
 
and
 
certain
 
of
 
our
 
subsidiaries
 
are
 
involved
 
in
 
various
 
legal
 
proceedings
 
and
 
other
 
legal
 
matters. Litigation, government 
investigations and
 
other legal matters
 
are inherently
 
unpredictable, and although
 
we believe we
 
have meaningful
 
defenses in these 
matters, we may incur liabilities due
 
to adverse judgments or penalties or
 
we may enter into settlements of
 
claims, which could 
have a material
 
adverse effect on
 
our results of
 
operations, cash flow
 
and financial condition.
 
For a discussion
 
of our ongoing 
legal proceedings see 
Part I. Item
 
3. Legal Proceedings
 
below and Part
 
II. Item 8.
 
Notes to the
 
Consolidated Financial Statements, 
Note
 
16 – Commitments
 
and Contingencies
.
 
Such lawsuits,
 
investigations and other
 
legal matters are
 
expensive to respond
 
to 
and
 
defend,
 
divert
 
management’s
 
attention,
 
and
 
may
 
result
 
in
 
significant
 
adverse
 
judgments,
 
penalties
 
or
 
settlements. Legal 
proceedings may expose us to negative publicity,
 
which could adversely affect our business reputation and customer preference 
for our products and brands. 
FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC RISK FACTORS 
Weak or unstable economic conditions, including continued high inflation
 
and interest rates, could negatively impact our 
business. 
Weak
 
or unstable economic conditions,
 
including continued high inflation
 
and interest rates, may
 
adversely affect our
 
business 
by: 
●
Limiting our access to capital markets or increasing the cost of capital we may need to grow or operate our business;
 
●
Changing consumer spending and habits and demand for eggs, particularly higher-priced eggs; 
●
Restricting the supply of energy sources or increasing our cost to procure energy; or 
●
Reducing the availability
 
of feed ingredients,
 
packaging material, and
 
other raw materials,
 
or increasing the
 
cost of these 
items. 
Deterioration of economic conditions could also negatively impact: 
●
The financial condition of our suppliers, which may make it more difficult for them to supply raw materials; 
●
The financial condition of our customers, which may decrease demand for eggs or increase our bad debt expense; or 
●
The financial condition of our insurers, which
 
could increase our cost to obtain insurance,
 
and/or make it difficult for or 
insurers to meet their obligations in the event we experience a loss due to an insured peril. 
According
 
to
 
the
 
U.S.
 
Bureau
 
of
 
Labor
 
Statistics,
 
from
 
May
 
2021
 
to
 
May
 
2022,
 
the
 
Consumer
 
Price Index for
 
All
 
Urban 
Consumers (“CPI-U”) increased 8.5 percent, the largest 12-month
 
increase since the period ending December 1981. The
 
CPI-U 
increased 4.1%, 3.3%, and 2.4% annually from May 2022 to May 2025. Inflationary costs have increased our input costs, and if 
we are unable to pass these costs through to the customer it could have an adverse effect on our business. 
We
 
hold significant
 
cash balances
 
in deposit
 
accounts with
 
deposits in
 
excess of
 
the amounts
 
insured by
 
the Federal
 
Deposit 
Insurance Corporation
 
(“FDIC”). In
 
the event
 
of a bank
 
failure at
 
an institution where
 
we maintain deposits
 
in excess of
 
the FDIC-
insured amount, we may lose such excess deposits. 
The
 
loss
 
of
 
any
 
registered
 
trademark
 
or
 
other
 
intellectual
 
property
 
could
 
enable
 
other
 
companies
 
to
 
compete
 
more 
effectively with us. 
We
 
utilize intellectual
 
property in
 
our business. For
 
example, we
 
own the
 
trademarks 
Farmhouse Eggs®
, 
4Grain®, Sunups®
, 
and 
Sunny Meadow®
. We
 
produce and market 
Egg-Land’s
 
Best®
 
and 
Land O’ Lakes
® under license agreements
 
with EB. We 








21 
have invested a
 
significant amount of
 
money in establishing
 
and promoting our
 
trademarked brands. The loss
 
or expiration of
 
any 
intellectual property
 
could enable
 
our competitors
 
to compete
 
more effectively
 
with us
 
by allowing
 
them to
 
make and
 
sell products 
substantially
 
similar
 
to
 
those
 
we
 
offer. This
 
could
 
negatively
 
impact
 
our
 
ability
 
to
 
produce
 
and
 
sell
 
those
 
products,
 
thereby 
adversely affecting our operations. 
Impairment in the
 
carrying value of
 
goodwill or other
 
assets could negatively
 
affect our results of
 
operations or net
 
worth. 
Goodwill
 
represents
 
the
 
excess
 
of
 
the
 
cost
 
of
 
business
 
acquisitions
 
over
 
the
 
fair
 
value
 
of
 
the
 
identifiable
 
net
 
assets 
acquired. Goodwill
 
is
 
reviewed
 
at
 
least
 
annually
 
for
 
impairment
 
by
 
assessing
 
qualitative
 
factors
 
to
 
determine
 
whether
 
the 
existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is
 
more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit 
is less than
 
its carrying amount. As
 
of May 31,
 
2025, we had
 
$46.8 million of goodwill. While
 
we believe the
 
current carrying 
value of this goodwill is
 
not impaired, future goodwill impairment
 
charges could adversely affect our results of
 
operations in any 
particular period and our net worth. 
Events beyond our control such as extreme weather and natural disasters could negatively impact our business.
 
Fire, bioterrorism,
 
pandemics, extreme
 
weather or
 
natural disasters,
 
including droughts,
 
floods, excessive
 
cold or
 
heat, water 
rights restrictions, hurricanes or other
 
storms, could impair the health
 
or growth of our flocks, decrease
 
production or availability 
of feed ingredients,
 
or interfere with
 
our operations due
 
to power outages,
 
fuel shortages, discharges
 
from overtopped or
 
breached 
wastewater treatment lagoons, damage to our production
 
and processing facilities, labor shortages or disruption
 
of transportation 
channels, among other things. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. 
RISK FACTORS RELATING
 
TO OUR COMMON STOCK 
Provisions of our certificate
 
of incorporation, bylaws,
 
and Delaware law may
 
make an acquisition
 
of us or a
 
change in our 
management more difficult.
Certain provisions of
 
our certificate of incorporation
 
and bylaws could
 
discourage, delay or
 
prevent a merger, acquisition or
 
other 
change in control that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which an investor might otherwise receive 
a premium for its shares. These
 
provisions also could limit the price
 
that investors might be willing
 
to pay in the future for
 
shares 
of our Common Stock, thereby depressing the
 
market price of our Common Stock. Stockholders
 
who wish to participate in these 
transactions may
 
not have
 
the opportunity
 
to do
 
so. Furthermore,
 
these provisions
 
could prevent
 
or frustrate
 
attempts by
 
our 
stockholders to replace or remove our management. These provisions: 
●
provide for the
 
division of the
 
Board into three
 
classes as nearly
 
equal in size as
 
practicable with staggered three-year 
terms and limit the removal of directors and the filling of vacancies; 
●
authorize our Board to set the
 
terms of and issue preferred stock, without
 
stockholder approval, that could be issued to 
persons friendly to management
 
or could operate as
 
a “poison pill” to
 
dilute the stock ownership
 
of a potential hostile 
acquirer to prevent an acquisition that is not approved by our Board; 
●
prohibit stockholder action by written consent; 
●
prohibit stockholders from calling special meetings of stockholders; 
●
establish advance notice requirements
 
for stockholder nominations
 
to our Board or
 
for stockholder proposals that
 
can be 
acted on at stockholder meetings; and 
●
require the approval of the
 
holders of at least 66-2/3%
 
of the voting power of all
 
then outstanding shares of capital
 
stock 
of the Company entitled
 
to vote generally in
 
the election of directors,
 
voting together as a
 
single class, in order
 
to amend 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws. 
In addition,
 
we are
 
governed by
 
the provisions
 
of Section
 
203 of
 
the Delaware
 
General Corporation
 
Law,
 
which may,
 
unless 
certain criteria are
 
met, prohibit large stockholders,
 
in particular those
 
owning 15% or
 
more of our
 
outstanding voting stock,
 
from 
merging or combining with us for a prescribed period of time. 
The loss of controlled company status could disrupt our business.
Until April 14,
 
2025, our Company
 
was controlled
 
by members of
 
the family
 
of our founder,
 
Fred R. Adams,
 
Jr. since its founding 
and since it became a public company.
 
As described in Part II. Item 8. Notes
 
to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 11 
– Equity,
 
on April
 
14, 2025,
 
the Company
 
ceased to
 
be a
 
“controlled company”
 
under the
 
rules of
 
The Nasdaq
 
Stock Market 
when all
 
of the
 
outstanding shares
 
of Class
 
A Common
 
Stock, all
 
of which
 
were controlled
 
by the
 
family,
 
were converted
 
to 
Common Stock.
 
Immediately prior thereto,
 
members of
 
the family-controlled shares
 
of Class
 
A Common
 
Stock and
 
Common 
Stock that
 
resulted in
 
voting power
 
of 53.2%.
 
After the
 
conversion of
 
the Class
 
A Common
 
Stock and
 
the subsequent
 
sale by 
family members in a registered
 
public offering of 2,978,740
 
shares of Common Stock on
 
April 17, 2025, and as
 
reported on an 








 


22 
amendment to Schedule 13D, the
 
family beneficially owned approximately 6.1% of
 
our outstanding Common Stock. Adolphus 
B. Baker,
 
Board Chair and a
 
family member, has
 
indicated that he is
 
willing to serve as
 
executive Board Chair at
 
least through 
our 2027 annual meeting
 
of stockholders. The effect of
 
the loss of controlled
 
company status on the
 
trading price of our
 
Common 
Stock and
 
on our
 
business is
 
uncertain, including
 
our ability
 
to retain
 
and hire
 
key personnel
 
and maintain
 
relationships with 
customers and suppliers,
 
and on our
 
operating results. In
 
addition, our business
 
may be more
 
likely to be
 
disrupted by persons 
seeking to influence or
 
effect a change
 
of control, change
 
of management or
 
change in governance of
 
our Company.
 
Any such 
disruptions to our business could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results. 
The price of
 
our Common Stock
 
may be affected
 
by the availability
 
of shares
 
for sale in
 
the market, and
 
investors may 
experience significant dilution
 
as a result of
 
future issuances of our
 
securities, which could
 
materially and adversely
 
affect 
the market price of our Common Stock.
The sale or availability for
 
sale of substantial amounts of
 
our Common Stock could adversely
 
impact the price of our
 
Common 
Stock. Our Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation authorizes
 
us to issue 120,000,000 shares of our Common 
Stock
 
and
 
10,000,000
 
shares
 
of
 
preferred
 
stock.
 
As
 
of
 
July
 
22,
 
2025,
 
there
 
were
 
48,497,477
 
shares
 
of
 
our
 
Common
 
Stock 
outstanding and
 
no shares
 
of preferred
 
stock outstanding.
 
Accordingly,
 
a substantial
 
number of
 
shares of
 
our Common
 
Stock 
remain authorized for issuance and could become available for sale in the market. Our Fourth
 
Amended and Restated Certificate 
of Incorporation authorizes our
 
Board to set the
 
terms of and issue
 
preferred stock, without stockholder
 
approval, and such shares 
if
 
issued
 
could
 
dilute
 
the
 
voting
 
and
 
economic
 
interests
 
of
 
holders
 
of
 
Common
 
Stock.
 
In
 
addition,
 
2,791,854
 
shares
 
of
 
our 
Common
 
Stock
 
held
 
by
 
the
 
family
 
of
 
our
 
late
 
founder
 
remain
 
subject
 
to
 
the
 
registration
 
rights
 
provided
 
by
 
the
 
Agreement 
Regarding Conversion, dated February 25, 2025, by and among the Company, DLNL, LLC and such family members. Also, we 
may be obligated to
 
issue additional shares of
 
our Common Stock in
 
connection with employee benefit
 
plans (including equity 
incentive plans or under our KSOP). 
In
 
the
 
future,
 
we
 
may
 
decide
 
to
 
raise
 
capital
 
through
 
offerings
 
of
 
our
 
Common
 
Stock,
 
preferred
 
stock,
 
additional
 
securities 
convertible into or exchangeable for our Common Stock of preferred stock, or rights
 
to acquire those securities or our Common 
Stock or
 
preferred stock.
 
We
 
may also
 
issue such
 
securities as
 
consideration in
 
an acquisition. The
 
issuance of
 
such securities 
could result in dilution of existing stockholders’
 
equity interests in us. Issuances of
 
substantial amounts of our Common Stock
 
or 
preferred stock, or
 
the perception that
 
such issuances could
 
occur, may adversely affect prevailing
 
market prices for
 
our Common 
Stock. 
The price of our Common Stock may fluctuate significantly. 
The market price of our Common Stock
 
has fluctuated significantly and may continue to
 
do so for various reasons including, but 
not limited to, the following, many of which are beyond our control: 
●
our quarterly or annual earnings or those of other companies in our industry; 
●
the public’s reaction to our press releases, our other public announcements and our filings with the SEC; 
●
changes in recommendations by research analysts who track our Common Stock or the stock of other companies in our 
industry, or a decision by such an analyst to reduce or cease coverage regarding our Common Stock; 
●
changes in
 
general conditions
 
in the
 
U.S. and
 
global economy, financial
 
markets or
 
our industry, including
 
those resulting 
from changes in trade and tariff
 
policies, changes in fuel prices
 
or fuel shortages, war, incidents of terrorism,
 
pandemics 
or responses to such events; 
●
changes
 
in
 
the
 
competitive
 
landscape
 
for
 
our
 
business,
 
including
 
any
 
changes
 
resulting
 
from
 
industry
 
consolidation 
whether or not involving us; 
●
our liquidity position; 
●
future sales of our Common Stock; 
●
any changes in our dividend policy or share repurchase program; and 
●
the other risks described in this Risk Factors section. 
The
 
actual
 
timing,
 
number
 
and
 
value
 
of
 
shares
 
repurchased
 
under
 
our
 
share
 
repurchase
 
program
 
will
 
be
 
determined
 
by 
management in
 
its discretion
 
and will
 
depend on
 
a number
 
of factors,
 
including but
 
not limited
 
to, the
 
market price
 
of our
 
Common 
Stock and general market and economic conditions. The share repurchase program may be suspended, modified or discontinued 
at any time without prior notice.

ITEM 1C.
 
CYBERSECURITY 
 
Risk Management and Strategy 
We
 
understand the importance of
 
cybersecurity and its role
 
in the success of
 
our Company.
 
Our business operations depend on 
the effective use of our information systems in order
 
to properly serve our customers, manage our business and track and report 
our financial results. Our technology
 
operations consider risks from cybersecurity
 
threats in the implementation and
 
execution of 
our business processes. We consider and assess the risks
 
from cybersecurity threats as part
 
of our overall risk assessment 
process
using the National Institute of Standards and Technology (“NIST”) Cybersecurity Framework.
 
In order to
 
identify, assess and
 
manage material
 
risks arising
 
from cybersecurity threats,
 
we maintain internal
 
resources to monitor 
and quickly respond to such threats. We
 
perform vulnerability scans and penetration testing designed to test the effectiveness of 
our
 
security
 
practices.
 
We 
engage
third
-party
 
service
 
providers
 
to
 
assist
 
in
 
the
 
evaluation
 
of
 
our
 
internal
 
controls
 
over
 
our 
information systems through
 
audit and
 
consulting services to
 
test the design
 
and operational effectiveness
 
of security controls. 
We continually monitor our systems to
 
detect and identify cybersecurity
 
threats. Prior to contracting
 
with third-party vendors, we 
perform risk assessments of the vendors
 
and require the vendors to manage
 
cybersecurity risks to our business operations
 
as well 
as
 
notify us
 
of
 
any
 
potential or
 
known
 
cybersecurity risks.
 
We
 
also require
 
our
 
employees
 
to
 
complete training
 
programs to 
increase their
 
awareness of
 
and sensitivity
 
to cybersecurity
 
threats. These
 
training programs
 
include the
 
identification of
 
such 
threats and the proper responses to a potential cybersecurity beach that aligns with our adopted processes.
The Company has implemented
 
a response process in
 
the event of a
 
cybersecurity incident through its crisis
 
management plan. 
The
 
process
 
includes
 
the
 
cooperation
 
of
 
the
 
information
 
technology
 
team
 
and
 
our
 
management
 
team
 
to
 
properly
 
detect
 
and 
respond to these
 
incidents. These responses
 
include determination of
 
the potential impact
 
and materiality of
 
the incident, potential 
disclosure
 
and
 
litigation
 
matters,
 
and
 
mitigation
 
of
 
actual
 
or
 
potential
 
damage
 
to
 
our
 
systems
 
or
 
reputation
 
arising
 
from
 
the 
incident. An action plan is implemented to
 
respond to any potential cybersecurity breach in
 
order to continue to effectively serve 
our customers and conduct our operations with as little interruption as practicable. The information technology team
 
reviews the 
response process on
 
a regular basis
 
to ensure that
 
it is designed
 
to be effective
 
and to encompass
 
current or new
 
cybersecurity 
threats. 
 


As of July
 
22, 2025,
 
we are 
no
t aware
 
of any
 
risks from
 
cybersecurity threats,
 
including as
 
a result
 
of prior
 
cybersecurity incidents, 
that have
 
materially affected
 
or that
 
we believe
 
are reasonably likely
 
to materially affect
 
the Company,
 
including our business 
strategy,
 
results
 
of
 
operations
 
or
 
financial
 
condition.
 
See 
Item
 
1A.
 
Risk
 
Factors
 
for
 
further
 
discussion
 
about
 
risks
 
from 
cybersecurity threats.
Governance 
The Board is responsible for the oversight of management’s
 
process for identifying and mitigating risks related to cybersecurity 
threats.
On a quarterly
 
basis, the Director
 
of Information Technology provides
 
a report to
 
the Audit Committee
 
regarding ongoing 
processes to improve and update
 
our current cybersecurity protocols, new
 
cybersecurity threats, results of internal
 
assessments, 
and any recent cybersecurity incidents.
The 
Audit
 
Committee will make the Board aware of any information it deems necessary 
or appropriate in order for the Board to effectively oversee the Company’s cybersecurity risk management and strategy.
The Director
 
of
 
Information Technology
 
and the
 
team he
 
manages
 
are responsible
 
for the
 
operation and
 
maintenance of
 
our 
information systems, including the assessment, identification and management of risks from cybersecurity threats.
Together,
 
the 
Director of Information Technology
 
and his team have over 150 years of experience
 
in the information technology and security 
environment.
 
Our 
Chief Financial Officer
, to
 
whom the
 
Director of
 
Information Technology reports,
 
has served
 
as Chief
 
Financial 
Officer and a Board member since 2018 and has over 40 years of risk management experience.

Common Stock
 
and Class
 
A Common
 
Stock. During
 
fiscal year

Dividends
 
Cal-Maine has
 
a variable
 
dividend policy
 
adopted by
 
the Board. Pursuant
 
to the
 
policy, Cal-Maine pays
 
a dividend
 
to stockholders 
of its Common Stock (and, when it was outstanding, Class A Common Stock) on a
 
quarterly basis for each quarter for which the 
Company reports net income attributable to Cal-Maine Foods,
 
Inc. computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles
 
(“GAAP”)
 
in
 
the
 
U.S.,
 
in
 
an
 
amount
 
equal
 
to
 
one-third
 
(1/3)
 
of
 
such
 
quarterly
 
net
 
income. Dividends
 
are
 
paid
 
to 
stockholders of record as of
 
the 60th day following
 
the last day of such
 
quarter, except for the fourth fiscal
 
quarter. For the fourth 
quarter, the
 
Company pays dividends to
 
stockholders of record on
 
the 65th day after
 
the quarter end. Dividends
 
are payable on 
the 15th
 
day following
 
the record
 
date. Following
 
a quarter
 
for which
 
the Company
 
does not
 
report net
 
income attributable
 
to 
Cal-Maine Foods, Inc., the Company will not pay a dividend for a subsequent profitable quarter until the
 
Company is profitable 
on a
 
cumulative basis
 
computed from
 
the date
 
of the
 
last quarter
 
for which
 
a dividend
 
was paid. Under
 
the Company's
 
Credit 
Facility, dividends are restricted to the amount permitted under the Company’s current dividend policy,
 
and may not be paid if a 
default exists or will
 
arise after giving effect
 
to the dividend or
 
if the sum of
 
cash and cash equivalents of
 
the Company and its 
subsidiaries plus availability under the Credit Facility equals less than $50 million.

COMPANY OVERVIEW 
Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. is primarily
 
engaged in the production, grading,
 
packaging, marketing and distribution
 
of fresh shell eggs, 
including
 
conventional,
 
cage-free,
 
organic,
 
brown,
 
free-range,
 
pasture-raised
 
and
 
nutritionally-enhanced eggs,
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
egg 
products and a variety of prepared
 
foods. Our fiscal year end is
 
the Saturday closest to May 31. The fiscal
 
years 2025 and 2024 
included 52 weeks and fiscal year 2023 included 53 weeks. The
 
Company, which is headquartered in
 
Ridgeland, Mississippi, is 
the
 
largest
 
producer
 
and
 
distributor
 
of
 
fresh
 
shell
 
eggs
 
in
 
the
 
United
 
States
 
(“U.S”).
 
In
 
fiscal
 
2025,
 
we
 
sold
 
approximately 
1.3 billion dozen shell
 
eggs, which we
 
believe represented approximately
 
24% of domestic
 
shell egg consumption.
 
Our total flock 
as of May 31, 2025 of
 
approximately 48.3 million layers and 11.5
 
million pullets and breeders is the
 
largest in the U.S. We
 
sell 
most of
 
our shell
 
eggs to
 
a diverse
 
group of
 
customers, including
 
national and
 
regional grocery
 
store chains,
 
club stores,
 
companies 
servicing independent supermarkets in the U.S., food service distributors,
 
and egg product consumers throughout the majority of 
the U.S. 
The Company has one operating and one
 
reportable segment, which is the production, packaging, marketing and
 
distribution of 
shell eggs, egg products
 
and prepared foods. Many of
 
our customers rely on
 
us to provide most
 
of their shell egg
 
needs, including 
specialty and
 
conventional eggs. We
 
have recently
 
expanded our
 
prepared foods
 
product offerings,
 
as described
 
in this
 
report. 
For further description of our business, refer to 
Part I. Item I. Business
.
ACQUISITIONS 
During the
 
first quarter
 
of fiscal
 
2025, we
 
acquired substantially
 
all the
 
commercial shell
 
egg production,
 
processing and
 
egg 
products breaking assets of ISE America, Inc. and certain of its
 
affiliates (“ISE”). The assets acquired included commercial shell 
egg
 
production
 
and
 
processing
 
facilities
 
with
 
a
 
capacity
 
at
 
the
 
time
 
of
 
acquisition of
 
approximately 4.7
 
million
 
laying
 
hens, 
including 1.0
 
million cage-free,
 
and 1.2
 
million pullets,
 
feed mills,
 
approximately 4,000
 
acres of
 
land, inventories
 
and an
 
egg 
products breaking facility. The acquired assets also include an extensive customer distribution network across the Northeast and 
Mid-Atlantic states, and production operations in Maryland, New Jersey, Delaware and South Carolina. These production assets 
are our first in Maryland, New Jersey and Delaware. We believe this acquisition provides us with an opportunity to significantly 
enhance our market reach in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states.
 
During the second
 
quarter of fiscal
 
2025, we completed
 
a strategic investment
 
with Crepini LLC,
 
establishing a new
 
egg products 
and prepared foods venture. Crepini LLC, founded in 2007, grew its brand throughout
 
the U.S. and Mexico featuring egg wraps, 
protein pancakes, crepes,
 
and wrap-ups, which
 
are sold online
 
and in over
 
3,500 retail stores.
 
The new entity, located in
 
Hopewell 
Junction, New
 
York,
 
operates as
 
Crepini Foods
 
LLC (“Crepini”).
 
We
 
capitalized Crepini with
 
approximately $6.75
 
million in 
cash
 
to
 
purchase
 
additional
 
equipment
 
and
 
other
 
assets
 
and
 
fund
 
working
 
capital
 
in
 
exchange
 
for
 
a
 
51%
 
interest
 
in
 
the
 
new 
venture. Crepini LLC contributed its existing assets and business in exchange for a 49% interest in the new venture. 
In fiscal 2022,
 
we announced a
 
strategic investment in
 
a new entity, MeadowCreek Food,
 
LLC (“MeadowCreek”), which
 
became 
a majority-owned subsidiary of
 
the Company.
 
During the fourth quarter
 
of fiscal 2023,
 
MeadowCreek began operations with
 
a 
focus on
 
being a
 
leading provider
 
of hard-cooked
 
eggs. During
 
the second
 
quarter of
 
fiscal 2025,
 
we acquired
 
the remaining 
ownership interests in MeadowCreek and it became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. 
During the
 
third quarter
 
of fiscal
 
2025, we
 
acquired certain
 
assets of
 
Deal-Rite Foods,
 
Inc. and
 
certain of
 
its affiliates
 
(“Deal-
Rite”). The assets acquired included two feed mills, storage facilities, usable
 
grain, vehicles, related equipment and a retail feed 
sales business located
 
in North
 
Carolina. The acquired
 
assets will produce
 
and deliver feed
 
to our nearby
 
shell egg production 
operations. 








28 
In the second quarter of
 
fiscal 2024, we acquired the
 
assets of Fassio Egg Farms,
 
Inc. (“Fassio”) related to its
 
commercial shell 
egg production and
 
processing business. Fassio
 
owned and operated
 
commercial shell egg
 
production and processing
 
facilities 
with a
 
capacity at
 
the time
 
of acquisition
 
of approximately
 
1.2 million
 
laying hens,
 
primarily cage-free,
 
a feed
 
mill, pullets,
 
a 
fertilizer production and composting operation and land located in Erda, Utah, outside Salt Lake City. This acquisition provided 
us with an opportunity to expand our market presence in Utah and the western U.S., particularly for cage-free eggs.
 
In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, we acquired a broiler processing
 
plant, hatchery and feed mill in Dexter, Missouri, which we 
repurposed for use in shell egg production. 
For additional discussion of our
 
acquisitions during fiscal 2024 and 2025,
 
see 
Note 2 – Acquisitions
 
in Part II. Item 8.
 
Notes to 
Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
In addition, subsequent to our fiscal 2025, the Company acquired Echo Lake Foods, LLC (formerly Echo Lake Foods, Inc.) and 
certain related companies (collectively “Echo Lake Foods”). Echo Lake
 
Foods is based in Burlington, Wisconsin
 
and produces, 
packages,
 
markets
 
and
 
distributes
 
prepared
 
foods,
 
including
 
waffles,
 
pancakes,
 
scrambled
 
eggs,
 
frozen
 
cooked
 
omelets,
 
egg 
patties, toast and diced
 
eggs. The purchase price
 
was approximately $258 million
 
and was funded with
 
available cash on hand. 
Refer to 
Part II. Item 8. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 17 – Subsequent Events
.
HPAI 
Outbreaks of HPAI
 
have continued
 
to occur
 
in U.S. poultry
 
flocks. Since the
 
HPAI
 
outbreaks in 2015,
 
there were no
 
reported 
significant
 
outbreaks
 
of
 
HPAI
 
in
 
the
 
commercial
 
table
 
egg
 
layer
 
flocks
 
until
 
the
 
February
 
–
 
December
 
2022
 
time
 
period. 
Thereafter,
 
there were
 
no HPAI
 
cases affecting
 
commercial layers
 
until November
 
2023. In
 
calendar year
 
2024, 40.2
 
million 
commercial
 
layer
 
hens
 
and
 
pullets
 
were
 
depopulated
 
due
 
to
 
HPAI,
 
and
 
in
 
calendar
 
year
 
2025,
 
an
 
additional
 
39.0
 
million 
commercial layer hens
 
and pullets
 
were depopulated
 
through May
 
due to
 
HPAI.
 
The United
 
States Department of
 
Agriculture 
(the “USDA”) reported that the
 
estimated table-egg layer flock as of
 
June 1, 2025 was approximately
 
285.5 million, compared to 
304.3 million, 321.6 million, 311.5 million and 330.5 million as of June 1, 2024, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
 
HPAI is currently widespread in the wild bird population
 
worldwide. We remain dedicated to robust biosecurity programs
 
across 
our locations and have invested more than $75 million in biosecurity
 
technology, equipment, procedures, and training across our 
locations since the
 
last major HPAI
 
outbreak in 2015.
 
However, no
 
farm is immune
 
from HPAI.
 
For example, during
 
the third 
and fourth quarters of fiscal 2024, we experienced
 
HPAI
 
outbreaks within our facilities located in Kansas and
 
Texas, which are 
now fully operational. According
 
to the U.S. Centers
 
for Disease Control and
 
Prevention (“CDC”), as of
 
June 5, 2025, there
 
were 
outbreaks in
 
1,073 herds
 
of dairy
 
cows in
 
17 states,
 
and 70
 
human cases
 
in the
 
U.S., almost
 
entirely among
 
poultry and
 
dairy 
workers. In
 
2024, one
 
of the
 
human cases
 
resulted in
 
severe illness
 
after the
 
patient was
 
exposed to
 
sick and
 
dead birds
 
in backyard 
flocks. The patient, who
 
was reported to have
 
underlying health conditions, died in
 
January 2025. There have been
 
no reported 
cases
 
of
 
person-to-person
 
spread.
 
According
 
to
 
the
 
CDC,
 
the
 
human
 
health
 
risk
 
to
 
the
 
U.S.
 
public
 
from
 
the
 
HPAI
 
virus
 
is 
considered to be low. The rate of depopulations slowed during our fourth quarter fiscal 2025 compared to our
 
third quarter fiscal 
2025 and there
 
were no reported
 
significant depopulations in
 
June and through
 
July 22, 2025.
 
However, the
 
extent of possible 
future outbreaks among U.S.
 
commercial egg layer
 
flocks, with heightened risk
 
during migration seasons, cannot
 
be predicted. 
According to the USDA, HPAI
 
cannot be transmitted through safely handled and properly cooked eggs. There is no known risk 
related to HPAI associated with eggs that are currently in the market and no eggs
 
have been recalled. For additional information, 
refer to 
Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors
.
We
 
have taken proactive
 
steps to help
 
mitigate the tight
 
egg supply situation
 
across the country.
 
Our efforts
 
resulted in a
 
18% 
increase in
 
the average
 
number of
 
layer hens
 
(reflecting re-start
 
of prior
 
year facility
 
outages and
 
both organic
 
and inorganic 
expansion) and a 56% increase
 
in total chicks hatched during
 
the fourth quarter of
 
fiscal 2025 compared to
 
the prior-year quarter. 
Our breeder flocks increased 48% as of the end of
 
fiscal 2025 compared to the end of fiscal 2024. We
 
also continue to invest in 
expansion projects
 
within our
 
current operations
 
that are
 
expected to
 
add approximately
 
1.1 million
 
cage-free layer
 
hens and 
250,000 pullets by
 
the end of
 
calendar 2025, and
 
added production support
 
through the integration
 
of recently acquired
 
assets, 
including the processing facilities from ISE and feed mills from Deal-Rite.

compared to fiscal 2023
 
were primarily a result
 
of a decrease in
 
average egg selling prices.
 
The average UB southeastern
 
large 
index price for fiscal 2024
 
decreased 34% compared to fiscal
 
2023. The decrease is
 
due in large part
 
to the recovery of
 
the egg 
supply
 
following
 
the
 
HPAI
 
outbreaks
 
during
 
most
 
of
 
calendar
 
year
 
2022.
 
However,
 
the
 
resurgence
 
of
 
HPAI
 
beginning
 
in 
November 2023 resulted
 
in the UB
 
southeastern large index
 
price being 9.1%
 
higher in the
 
fourth quarter of
 
fiscal 2024 compared 
to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023.
 
Our dozens sold for fiscal 2024
 
remained relatively flat compared to fiscal
 
2023. We had an increase in production capacity with 
the acquisition
 
of the
 
commercial shell
 
egg production
 
and processing
 
business of
 
Fassio Egg
 
Farms, Inc.
 
during fiscal
 
2024, 
which was offset by the temporary decrease in production due to the HPAI outbreaks at our facilities.
 
For fiscal 2025, we recognized net sales of $4.3 billion and net income of $1.2 billion. We recorded a gross profit of $1.9 billion 
compared to $541.6
 
million for
 
fiscal 2024, primarily
 
driven by an
 
increase in the
 
net average selling
 
price of shell
 
eggs, primarily 
conventional egg prices, as well
 
as an increase in total
 
dozens sold. Our results were
 
also positively impacted by lower
 
feed costs 
and our
 
recent acquisitions
 
discussed above,
 
and were
 
partially offset
 
by an
 
increase in
 
the volume
 
and price
 
of outside
 
egg 
purchases. 
Our net average selling price
 
per dozen for fiscal 2025
 
was $3.134 compared to $1.932
 
in fiscal 2024. Conventional egg
 
prices 
per dozen were
 
$3.490 compared to
 
$1.730 for the
 
prior year, and specialty
 
egg prices per
 
dozen were $2.519
 
compared to $2.309 
for the
 
prior year.
 
Egg prices
 
in fiscal
 
2025 were
 
elevated compared
 
to fiscal
 
2024, primarily
 
due to
 
the resurgence
 
of HPAI 
outbreaks, which decreased supply during
 
the higher seasonal demand
 
cycle. According to the
 
USDA, the size of
 
the layer hen 
flock was 285.5 million hens
 
at June 1, 2025, compared
 
to the five-year average of
 
313.1 million hens. The daily average
 
price 
for the Urner Barry southeast large index for fiscal 2025 increased 118.3%
 
from fiscal 2024.
 
Our dozens sold
 
for fiscal 2025
 
increased 11.8%
 
compared to fiscal
 
2024. We
 
had an
 
increase in production
 
capacity with the 
acquisitions of
 
the commercial
 
shell egg
 
production and
 
processing business
 
of ISE
 
during the
 
first quarter
 
of fiscal
 
2025. In 
addition, sales increased in part due to increased volumes of outside egg purchases to provide shell
 
eggs to our customers during 
the peak of HPAI outbreaks during the second and third quarters of fiscal 2025. 
Our feed costs per dozen
 
produced decreased to $0.490 in
 
fiscal 2025, compared to $0.550
 
in fiscal 2024. For fiscal
 
year 2025, 
the average Chicago Board
 
of Trade
 
(“CBOT”) daily market price
 
was $4.38 per bushel
 
for corn and $311
 
per ton for soybean 
meal, representing decreases of 8.1% and 20.1%, respectively,
 
compared to the daily average CBOT prices for
 
fiscal 2024. Our 
egg purchases and other cost of sales increased $439.4 million compared to fiscal 2024,
 
primarily due to higher shell egg prices 
as well
 
as an
 
increase in
 
dozens purchased
 
to supply
 
eggs for
 
our customers,
 
including those
 
acquired in
 
our ISE
 
acquisition, 
during the higher seasonal demand cycle while the nation experienced lower supply due to HPAI.

Shell egg sales 
-
For
 
fiscal
 
2025,
 
shell
 
egg
 
sales
 
increased
 
$1.8
 
billion
 
compared
 
to
 
fiscal
 
2024,
 
primarily
 
due
 
to
 
the
 
increase
 
in
 
net 
average selling prices for conventional eggs, and to a lesser extent the increase in dozens sold. 
-
For fiscal 2025, conventional egg sales increased $1.5 billion, or 119.5%, compared to fiscal 2024, primarily due to the 
increase
 
in
 
conventional
 
egg
 
prices.
 
Changes in
 
price resulted
 
in
 
a $1.4
 
billion
 
increase in
 
net
 
sales and
 
changes
 
in 
volume resulted
 
in a
 
$114
 
million increase
 
in net
 
sales. Conventional
 
egg prices
 
increased significantly
 
during fiscal 
2025 due to a resurgence of HPAI outbreaks, which decreased the supply.
 
-
Specialty egg
 
sales increased
 
$258.8 million,
 
or 28.0%,
 
for fiscal
 
2025 compared
 
to fiscal
 
2024, primarily
 
due to a
 
17.3% 
increase in
 
the volume
 
of specialty
 
dozens sold,
 
and to
 
a lesser
 
extent a
 
9.1% increase
 
in price.
 
Changes in
 
volume 
resulted in a $159.9 million increase in net sales and changes in price resulted in a $98.7 million increase in net sales.
 
-
Our dozens sold
 
for fiscal 2025
 
increased 11.8%
 
compared to fiscal
 
2024. We
 
had an
 
increase in production
 
capacity 
with the acquisition
 
of the commercial
 
shell egg production
 
and processing business
 
of ISE during
 
the first quarter
 
of 
fiscal 2025 as well as the resumption of full operations at our facilities in Chase, KS, and Farwell, TX, which were shut 
down in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2024 due to HPAI outbreaks. 
Egg products and prepared foods sales 
-
Egg products and prepared foods sales increased $109.8 million, or 123.4% compared to fiscal 2024, primarily due to a 
138.7% increase in sales of liquid eggs, which had a $54.9
 
million positive impact on net sales, and a 41.4% increase in 
volume of liquid egg products sold.
 
The increase in volume, which had a
 
$23.3 million positive impact on net
 
sales, is 
primarily related to the acquisition of ISE, which included a breaking facility. 
-
Our egg products net average selling price increased in fiscal 2025, compared to fiscal 2024 as the supply of shell eggs 
used to produce egg products decreased due to the resurgence of HPAI outbreaks. 
-
Sales from hard-cooked eggs increased
 
$22.7 million or 137.3% to 39.1
 
million in fiscal 2025, compared to
 
fiscal 2024, 
as more processing capabilities came online throughout fiscal 2025 from our investments in MeadowCreek. 
Other 
-
Other sales increased compared to
 
the prior year period primarily
 
due to higher feed sales
 
related to our ISE acquisition.

COST OF SALES 
Cost of
 
sales consists
 
of costs
 
directly related
 
to producing,
 
processing and
 
packing shell
 
eggs, purchases
 
of shell
 
eggs from 
outside sources, processing and packing of egg products and other non-egg costs. Farm production costs are those costs
 
incurred 
at the egg production facility, including feed, facility
 
(including labor), hen amortization and
 
other related farm production costs.

Farm Production 
-
Feed costs
 
per dozen
 
produced decreased
 
10.9% in
 
fiscal 2025
 
compared to
 
fiscal 2024,
 
primarily due
 
to lower
 
feed 
ingredient prices. The decrease in feed cost per dozen
 
resulted in a decrease in cost of sales of
 
$68.2 million compared 
to the prior year. 
-
For fiscal 2025, the average daily CBOT market price was $4.38 per bushel for corn and $311 per ton of soybean meal, 
representing decreases of 8.1% and 20.1%, respectively, as compared to the average daily CBOT prices for fiscal 2024. 
-
Other farm production costs per dozen produced decreased primarily due to lower flock amortization. Feed costs 
reached their peak in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and have since trended downward. Lower costs resulted in 
lower capitalized values of the flocks during the grow out phase, which reduced amortization cost over time.
 
Current indications for corn
 
and soybean project
 
a neutral stocks-to-use ratio
 
in the near term
 
compared with the levels
 
prevailing 
today; however,
 
as long
 
as outside
 
factors remain
 
uncertain (including
 
weather patterns
 
and global
 
supply chain
 
disruptions), 
volatility could remain.
 
Processing, packaging, and warehouse 
-
Processing, packaging, and
 
warehouse costs increased
 
primarily due to
 
an 11.7%
 
increase in the
 
volume of processed 
dozens as well as an increase in costs of packaging materials. 
Egg purchases and other cost of sales 
-
Costs in
 
this category
 
increased primarily due
 
to higher
 
shell egg
 
prices as
 
the average
 
cost per
 
dozen of
 
outside egg 
purchases increased 69.9%
 
compared to fiscal
 
2024, as well
 
as due to an
 
increase of 27.6%
 
in dozens purchased.
 
Dozens 
purchased increased due
 
to purchasing more
 
eggs to supply
 
our customers while
 
the nation experienced
 
lower supply 
due to HPAI.

GROSS PROFIT 
Gross
 
profit,
 
as
 
a
 
percentage
 
of
 
net
 
sales,
 
was
 
43.4%
 
for
 
fiscal
 
2025,
 
compared
 
to
 
23.3%
 
for
 
fiscal
 
2024.
 
The
 
increase
 
was 
primarily due to higher net average selling
 
prices, particularly for conventional eggs, and higher volumes,
 
as well as lower feed 
ingredient prices, partially offset by the increase in volume and price of outside egg purchases. 
SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES 
Selling, general, and administrative (“SGA”)
 
expenses include costs of delivery, marketing, and
 
other general and administrative 
expenses. Delivery expense includes contract trucking expense
 
and all costs to maintain and operate
 
our fleet of trucks to deliver 
products to
 
customers including
 
the related
 
payroll expenses.
 
Marketing expense
 
includes franchise
 
fees that
 
are submitted
 
to 
Eggland’s Best, Inc. (“EB”) to
 
support the EB
 
brand, brokerage and
 
commission fees, and
 
other general marketing
 
expenses such 
as
 
payroll expenses
 
for our

N.M. - Not Meaningful 
Delivery expense 
-
The increased delivery expense is primarily due to an increase
 
in our sales volumes of egg and egg products
 
compared 
to fiscal 2024.
 
Contract trucking
 
expenses increased
 
in connection
 
with our
 
acquisition of
 
ISE and our
 
facilities in
 
Chase, 
KS and Farwell, TX being fully operational in fiscal year 2025. 
Marketing expense 
-
Marketing expense increased
 
slightly in fiscal
 
2025 compared to
 
fiscal 2024 primarily
 
due to an
 
increase in franchise 
fees as specialty sales increased. 
Litigation loss contingency accrual 
-
In the second quarter of fiscal 2024, we accrued a $19.6 million loss contingency relating to a jury decision returned in 
pending anti-trust
 
litigation. See
 
further discussion
 
in 
Note 16
 
– Commitments
 
and Contingencies
 
of Part
 
II. Item
 
8. 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Other general and administrative expenses 
-
The increase
 
in other
 
general and
 
administrative expense
 
is primarily
 
due both
 
to an
 
increase in
 
the accrual
 
for anticipated 
employee bonuses
 
and to
 
a $15
 
million increased
 
adjustment to
 
the fair
 
value of
 
contingent consideration
 
associated 
with the
 
Fassio acquisition.

(GAIN) LOSS ON INVOLUNTARY
 
CONVERSIONS 
For fiscal 2025
 
and 2024, we
 
recorded a loss
 
of $156 thousand
 
and gain of
 
$23.5 million, respectively. The gain
 
recorded in fiscal 
2024 was due
 
to recoveries
 
under indemnity
 
and insurance
 
programs that exceeded
 
the amortized
 
book value
 
of the covered
 
assets 
and our direct costs, primarily related to the HPAI outbreaks
 
at our Kansas and Texas facilities. 








 


34 
OPERATING
 
INCOME 
As a result of the above, our operating income was $1.5 billion for fiscal 2025, compared to $312.5 million for fiscal 2024. 
OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE) 
Total
 
other
 
income
 
(expense)
 
consists
 
of
 
items
 
not
 
directly
 
charged
 
to,
 
or
 
related
 
to, operations
 
such
 
as
 
interest
 
income
 
and 
expense, equity in
 
income or loss
 
of unconsolidated entities,
 
and patronage dividends, among
 
other items. Patronage dividends 
are paid to us from our membership in the EB cooperative. 
The Company recorded interest income of $48.7 million
 
in fiscal 2025, compared to $32.3 million in
 
fiscal 2024, primarily due 
to significantly higher
 
cash and cash
 
equivalents and investment
 
securities available-for-sale balances
 
and yields. We
 
recorded 
interest expense of $612
 
thousand and $549 thousand
 
in fiscal 2025 and
 
2024, respectively, primarily related to commitment
 
fees 
on our Credit Facility described below. 
INCOME TAXES 
For the fiscal year ended
 
May 31, 2025, our pre-tax
 
income was $1.6 billion, compared
 
to $360.0 million for fiscal
 
2024. Income 
tax expense
 
of $384.9
 
million was

expense was $83.7 million with an effective tax rate of 23.2%.
 
Items causing
 
our effective
 
tax rate
 
to differ
 
from the
 
federal statutory
 
income tax
 
rate of
 
21% are
 
state income
 
taxes, certain 
federal tax credits
 
and certain items included
 
in income or
 
loss for financial reporting
 
purposes that are
 
not included in taxable 
income or loss
 
for income tax
 
purposes, including tax exempt
 
interest income, certain nondeductible
 
expenses, and net
 
income 
or loss attributable to noncontrolling interest. 
NET LOSS ATTRIBUTABLE
 
TO NONCONTROLLING INTEREST 
Net loss attributable
 
to noncontrolling interest
 
was $1.8 million
 
for fiscal 2025
 
compared to a
 
$1.6 million net
 
loss for fiscal
 
2024. 
NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE
 
TO CAL-MAINE FOODS, INC. 
As a result
 
of the above,
 
net income attributable
 
to Cal-Maine Foods,
 
Inc. for fiscal
 
2025 was $1.2
 
billion, or $25.04
 
per basic 
and $24.95 per diluted share, compared to $277.9 million, or $5.70 per basic and $5.69 per diluted share for fiscal 2024. 
Fiscal Year
 
Ended June 1, 2024 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended June 3, 2023 
The discussion of our results of operations for the fiscal year ended June 1, 2024 compared to the fiscal year ended June 3, 2023 
can be found in Part II.

Company’s fiscal 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
We aim to maintain
 
a strong balance
 
sheet and liquidity, particularly
 
given the cyclical
 
nature of our
 
business. We believe a
 
strong 
balance sheet supports our growth opportunities and stockholder returns. Our priorities for the use of cash in
 
recent periods have 
included the payment of
 
dividends pursuant to our
 
variable dividend policy, inorganic growth through acquisitions
 
of businesses, 
organic
 
growth
 
including
 
construction
 
and
 
conversion
 
of
 
cage-free
 
facilities
 
and
 
investment
 
in
 
value-added
 
products,
 
and 
maintenance capital expenditures. 
Working Capital and Current Ratio 
Our working
 
capital at
 
May 31,
 
2025 was
 
$1.7 billion, compared
 
to $1.0
 
billion at
 
June 1,
 
2024. The
 
calculation of
 
working 
capital is defined as
 
current assets less current
 
liabilities. Our current ratio was
 
6.4 at May 31,
 
2025 compared to 5.5
 
at June 1, 
2024. The current ratio is calculated by dividing
 
current assets by current liabilities. The increase
 
in our current ratio is primarily 
due to the increase in total current assets, which increased by $726.3 million to $2.0 billion at May 31, 2025, due to increases in 
cash
 
and
 
cash
 
equivalents
 
and
 
investment
 
securities
 
available-for-sale.
 
Due
 
to
 
seasonal
 
factors
 
described
 
in 
Part
 
I.
 
Item
 
I. 
Business – Seasonality
, we generally
 
expect our
 
need for working
 
capital to be
 
highest in
 
the fourth and
 
first fiscal
 
quarters ending 
in May/June and August/September, respectively.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
Net cash
 
provided by
 
operating activities
 
was $1.2
 
billion for
 
fiscal 2025,
 
compared to
 
$451.4 million for
 
fiscal 2024.
 
The increase 
in
 
cash
 
flow
 
from
 
operating
 
activities
 
resulted
 
primarily
 
from
 
higher
 
net
 
average
 
selling
 
prices
 
per
 
dozen,
 
particularly
 
for 
conventional eggs, increased volume of sales and
 
a decrease in feed ingredient costs compared
 
to the prior year,
 
partially offset 
by the increase in volume and price of outside egg purchases. 
Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
For fiscal 2025, $575.5 million was
 
used in investing activities, primarily due
 
to purchases of investment securities,
 
purchases of 
property, plant and equipment
 
and the acquisition
 
of assets of
 
ISE compared to
 
$412.6 million used
 
in investing activities
 
in fiscal 
2024, primarily due to purchases
 
of investment securities, purchases of
 
property, plant and equipment and the Fassio acquisition. 
Purchases of investment
 
securities were $1.2
 
billion in fiscal
 
2025 compared to
 
$573.6 million in
 
fiscal 2024. Sales
 
and maturities 
of investment securities were
 
$907.6 million in fiscal
 
2025, compared to $358.9 million
 
for fiscal 2024. The increase
 
in sales and 
maturities of investment securities is primarily due to the maturities of
 
short-term investments during fiscal 2025. Cash paid for 
business acquisitions was $116.2 million in
 
fiscal 2025, primarily related to
 
the ISE acquisition, and
 
$53.7 million in fiscal 2024, 
related to
 
the Fassio
 
acquisition. Purchases
 
of property,
 
plant and
 
equipment were
 
$161.3 million
 
and $147.1
 
million in
 
fiscal 
2025 and 2024, respectively, primarily reflecting progress on our construction projects. 
Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
We
 
paid
 
dividends
 
totaling
 
$330.3
 
million
 
and
 
$91.9
 
million
 
in
 
fiscal
 
2025
 
and
 
2024,
 
respectively.
 
During
 
fiscal
 
2025,
 
we 
repurchased $54.0 million
 
in shares of
 
Common Stock, primarily
 
under our share
 
repurchase program. See
 
“Share Repurchase 
Program,” below. 
Increase (decrease) in Cash and Cash Equivalents 
As of May 31, 2025, cash increased $261.5 million since June 1, 2024, compared to a $54.9 million decrease
 
during fiscal 2024. 
The increase is primarily due to the increase in net sales during fiscal 2025. 
Acquisition of Echo Lake Foods 
Subsequent to our fiscal 2025 year-end, we acquired Echo Lake Foods. The purchase price was approximately $258 million and 
was funded with available cash on hand. For additional information, refer to Part II. Item 8. Notes to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements, 
Note 17 – Subsequent Events
.
Credit Facility 
On November 15,
 
2021, we entered
 
into an Amended
 
and Restated Credit
 
Agreement (as amended,
 
the “Credit Agreement”)
 
with 
a five-year term. The Credit Agreement provides
 
for a senior secured revolving credit facility
 
(the “Credit Facility”), in an initial 
aggregate principal amount of up to $250 million. As of May 31, 2025, no amounts were borrowed under the Credit Facility. As 
of May 31, 2025, we
 
had $4.7 million in outstanding
 
standby letters of credit, which
 
were issued under our Credit
 
Facility for the 
benefit of
 
certain insurance
 
companies. On
 
March 25,
 
2025, we
 
entered into
 
the Second
 
Amendment to
 
the Credit
 
Facility to 
amend the definition
 
of Change of
 
Control to exclude
 
the conversion of
 
all outstanding shares
 
of Class A
 
Common Stock into 
Common Stock.

Share Repurchase Program 
On
 
February
 
25,
 
2025,
 
the
 
Board
 
approved
 
a
 
new
 
$500
 
million
 
share
 
repurchase
 
program.
 
The
 
share
 
repurchase
 
program 
authorizes the Company, in management’s discretion, to repurchase Common Stock from time to time for
 
an aggregate purchase 
price up
 
to $500
 
million (exclusive
 
of any
 
fees, taxes,
 
commissions or
 
other expenses
 
related to
 
such repurchases),
 
subject to 
market
 
conditions
 
and
 
other
 
factors.
 
The
 
actual
 
timing,
 
number
 
and
 
value
 
of
 
shares
 
repurchased
 
under
 
the
 
program
 
will
 
be 
determined by
 
management in
 
its discretion
 
and will
 
depend on
 
a number
 
of factors,
 
including, but
 
not limited
 
to, the
 
market 
price of the Common Stock and general market and economic conditions. 








 


 


 


 


 


 


 


 


 


 


 


 


 


 


 


 


 


 


 


 


 


 


 


 


 


 


 


 


36 
The Company expects to strategically and opportunistically repurchase shares from time to time through solicited or unsolicited 
transactions in the
 
open market, in
 
privately negotiated transactions
 
or by other
 
means in accordance
 
with securities laws.
 
The 
Company expects that share repurchases under the program will be
 
funded from one or a combination of existing cash balances 
and future free
 
cash flow.
 
The share repurchase
 
program does not
 
obligate the Company
 
to repurchase any
 
specific amount of 
shares, does
 
not have an
 
expiration date, and
 
may be suspended,
 
modified or
 
discontinued at
 
any time without
 
prior notice. During 
fiscal
 
2025,
 
the
 
Company
 
repurchased
 
approximately
 
$50
 
million
 
in
 
shares
 
under
 
the
 
program.

for further information. 
Dividends 
In
 
accordance
 
with
 
our
 
variable
 
dividend
 
policy,
 
we
 
will
 
pay
 
a
 
cash
 
dividend
 
totaling
 
approximately
 
$114.2
 
million,
 
or 
approximately $2.362 per share, to holders
 
of our Common Stock with respect
 
to our fourth quarter of fiscal
 
2025. The amount 
paid per
 
share will vary
 
based on
 
the number of
 
outstanding shares on
 
the record date.
 
The dividend is
 
payable on August
 
19, 
2025 to holders of record on August 4, 2025. 
Material Cash Requirements 
Material cash
 
requirements for operating
 
activities primarily consist
 
of feed
 
ingredients, processing, packaging
 
and warehouse 
costs, employee related costs, and
 
other general operating expenses, which
 
we expect to be paid
 
from our cash from operations 
and cash and investment
 
securities on hand for
 
at least the next
 
12 months. While volatile
 
egg prices and feed
 
ingredient costs, 
among
 
other
 
things, make
 
long-term predictions
 
difficult,
 
we
 
have
 
substantial liquid
 
assets and
 
availability under
 
our
 
Credit 
Facility to fund future operating requirements. 
Our material cash requirements for capital expenditures consist primarily of our projects to increase our cage-free production 
capacity. We
 
continue to monitor the increasing demand for cage-free eggs and to engage with our customers in efforts to help 
them achieve their announced timelines for cage-free egg sales. The following table presents material construction
 
projects 
approved as of May 31, 2025 (in thousands):

had $75.5 million
 
of purchase obligations
 
outstanding, all of
 
which is due
 
within one year.
 
Purchase 
obligations primarily
 
include contractual
 
agreements to
 
purchase feed ingredients
 
and commitments
 
to make
 
capital expenditures. 
Timing
 
of payments
 
and actual
 
amounts paid
 
may be
 
different depending
 
on the
 
timing of
 
the receipt
 
of goods
 
or services
 
or 
changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations.
 
We
 
believe our
 
current cash
 
balances, investments,
 
projected cash
 
flows from
 
operations, and
 
available borrowings
 
under our 
Credit Facility will
 
be sufficient
 
to fund our
 
capital needs for
 
at least the
 
next 12 months
 
and to fund
 
our capital commitments 
currently in place thereafter. 
IMPACT OF RECENTLY
 
ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS 
For information on changes in accounting principles and new accounting principles, see “
New Accounting Pronouncements and 
Policies
” in Part II. Item 8. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, 
Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
The preparation of financial statements
 
in accordance with U.S. GAAP
 
requires management to make estimates
 
and assumptions 
that affect the
 
reported amounts
 
of assets
 
and liabilities
 
at the
 
date of
 
the financial
 
statements and
 
the reported
 
amounts of
 
revenues 
and expenses
 
during the
 
reporting period. Actual
 
results could
 
differ materially
 
from these
 
estimates. Critical
 
accounting estimates 
are those estimates made in accordance with GAAP that involve a significant level
 
of estimation uncertainty and have had or are 
reasonably likely to have a
 
material impact on the financial condition
 
or results of operations. Our
 
critical accounting estimates 
are described below. 








37 
BUSINESS COMBINATIONS 
The Company applies the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that once control is obtained, all
 
the assets acquired 
and liabilities assumed, including amounts
 
attributable to noncontrolling interests, are
 
recorded at their respective fair
 
values at 
the
 
date
 
of acquisition.
 
The
 
excess
 
of
 
the
 
purchase
 
price
 
over
 
fair
 
values
 
of
 
identifiable
 
assets
 
and
 
liabilities
 
is
 
recorded
 
as 
goodwill. 
We
 
typically use
 
the income
 
method approach
 
for intangible
 
assets acquired
 
in a
 
business combination.
 
Significant judgment 
exists in valuing certain
 
intangible assets and the
 
most significant assumptions
 
requiring judgment involve estimating
 
the amount 
and timing of future
 
cash flows, growth rates,
 
discount rates selected to
 
measure the risks inherent
 
in the future cash
 
flows and 
the asset’s expected useful lives.
 
The
 
fair
 
values of
 
identifiable assets
 
and
 
liabilities are
 
generally
 
determined internally
 
and
 
requires estimates
 
and
 
the
 
use
 
of 
various valuation
 
techniques. When
 
a market
 
value is
 
not readily
 
available, our
 
internal valuation
 
methodology considers
 
the 
remaining estimated life
 
of the assets
 
acquired and significant
 
judgment is required
 
as management determines
 
the fair market 
value for those assets.
 
Due
 
to
 
inherent
 
industry
 
uncertainties
 
including
 
volatile
 
egg
 
prices
 
and
 
feed
 
costs,
 
unanticipated
 
market
 
changes, events,
 
or 
circumstances may occur that could affect the estimates and assumptions used, which could result in subsequent impairments.
 
INVENTORIES
 
Inventories of eggs, feed, supplies and flocks
 
are valued principally at the lower of
 
cost or net realizable value. If market
 
prices 
for eggs
 
and feed
 
grains move
 
substantially lower,
 
we record
 
adjustments to
 
write down
 
the carrying
 
values of
 
eggs and
 
feed 
inventories to fair market value. The cost associated
 
with flock inventories, consisting principally of chick
 
purchases or hatching 
costs,
 
feed,
 
labor,
 
contractor
 
payments
 
and
 
overhead
 
costs,
 
are
 
accumulated
 
during
 
the
 
hatching
 
and
 
growing
 
periods
 
of 
approximately
 
22
 
weeks. Capitalized
 
flock
 
costs
 
are
 
then
 
amortized
 
over
 
the
 
flock’s
 
productive
 
life,
 
generally
 
one
 
to
 
two 
years. Judgment exists in determining the flock’s
 
productive life including factors such as laying
 
rate and egg size, molt cycles, 
and customer demand. Furthermore, other factors such as hen type
 
or weather conditions could affect the productive life.
 
These 
factors could make
 
our estimates of
 
productive life differ
 
materially from actual
 
results. Flock mortality
 
is charged to cost
 
of sales 
as
 
incurred. High
 
mortality
 
from
 
disease
 
or
 
extreme
 
temperatures
 
will
 
result
 
in
 
abnormal
 
write-downs
 
to
 
flock 
inventories. Management
 
continually
 
monitors
 
each
 
flock
 
and
 
attempts
 
to
 
take
 
appropriate
 
actions
 
to
 
minimize
 
the
 
risk
 
of 
mortality loss. 
GOODWILL 
As a result of acquiring businesses,
 
the Company had $46.8 million of goodwill
 
as of May 31, 2025, representing
 
1.5% of total 
assets
 
and
 
1.8%
 
of
 
stockholders’
 
equity.
 
Goodwill
 
is
 
evaluated
 
for
 
impairment
 
annually
 
(or
 
more
 
frequently
 
if
 
impairment 
indicators arise) by first
 
performing a qualitative assessment
 
to determine whether a
 
quantitative goodwill test is
 
necessary. After 
assessing the totality of events or
 
circumstances, if we determine it is
 
more likely than not that the
 
fair value of a reporting
 
unit 
is less
 
than its
 
carrying amount,
 
then we
 
perform additional
 
quantitative tests
 
to determine
 
the magnitude
 
of any
 
impairment. 
During
 
our
 
annual
 
impairment
 
test,
 
which
 
was
 
the
 
first
 
day
 
of
 
the
 
fourth
 
quarter,
 
we
 
determined
 
that
 
goodwill
 
passed
 
the 
qualitative assessment and therefore no quantitative analysis of goodwill impairment was necessary in fiscal 2025. 
The
 
Company
 
has
 
determined
 
that
 
all
 
of
 
our
 
locations
 
share
 
similar
 
economic
 
characteristics
 
and
 
support
 
each
 
other
 
in
 
the 
production of eggs and customer support.
 
Therefore, we aggregate all our locations
 
as a single reporting unit for
 
testing goodwill 
for
 
impairment.
 
When
 
the
 
Company
 
acquires
 
a
 
new
 
location,
 
we
 
determine
 
whether
 
it
 
should
 
be
 
integrated
 
into
 
our
 
single 
reporting unit
 
or treated
 
as a separate
 
reporting unit.
 
Historically, we have concluded
 
that acquired
 
operations should
 
be integrated 
into our single reporting unit due to the
 
operational changes, redistribution of customers, and significant
 
changes in management 
that occur when we acquire businesses, which result in the acquired operations sharing similar economic characteristics with the 
rest of our locations. Once goodwill associated with acquired operations becomes
 
part of goodwill of our single reporting unit, it 
no longer represents the particular acquired operations that gave rise to the goodwill. We
 
may conclude that a business acquired 
in the future should be treated as a separate reporting unit, in which case it would be tested separately for goodwill impairment. 
Judgment exists in management’s evaluation of the qualitative factors which include macroeconomic conditions, the current egg 
industry environment, cost
 
inputs such as
 
feed ingredients and
 
overall financial performance.
 
Furthermore, judgment exists
 
in the 
evaluation of
 
the threshold
 
of whether
 
it is
 
more likely
 
than not
 
that the
 
fair value
 
of a
 
reporting unit
 
is less
 
than its
 
carrying 
amount. Uncertainty exists due to uncontrollable events that could occur that could negatively affect our operating conditions.
 








38 
REVENUE RECOGNITION 
Revenue
 
recognition
 
is
 
completed upon
 
satisfaction of
 
the
 
performance obligation
 
which
 
generally
 
occurs
 
upon
 
shipment
 
or 
delivery to a customer based on terms of the sale. 
Revenues are
 
recognized in
 
an amount
 
that reflects
 
the net
 
consideration we
 
expect to
 
receive in
 
exchange for
 
delivery of
 
the 
products. The Company periodically
 
offers sales incentives or other
 
programs such as rebates,
 
discounts, coupons, volume-based 
incentives, guaranteed sales
 
and other programs.
 
The Company records
 
an estimated allowance
 
for costs associated
 
with these 
programs, which is recorded
 
as a reduction in
 
revenue at the time
 
of sale using historical
 
trends and projected redemption
 
rates 
of
 
each program.
 
The Company
 
regularly reviews
 
these estimates
 
and
 
any difference
 
between the
 
estimated costs
 
and actual 
realization of these programs would be recognized in the subsequent period. 
As the estimates
 
noted above are
 
based on historical
 
information, we do
 
not believe that
 
there will be
 
a material change
 
in the 
estimates and assumptions used to recognize revenue. However, if actual results varied significantly from our estimates, it could 
expose us to material gains or losses.
 
LOSS CONTINGENCIES 
The Company evaluates whether a loss contingency exists,
 
and if the assessment of a
 
contingency indicates it is probable that a 
material loss has been
 
incurred and the amount
 
of the loss can
 
be reasonably estimated, the
 
estimated loss would be
 
accrued in 
the Company’s financial statements. The Company expenses the costs of litigation as they are incurred. 
Except for
 
the $19.6
 
million litigation loss
 
contingency accrual in
 
fiscal 2024,
 
there were no
 
loss contingency accruals
 
for the 
past three fiscal years. Our evaluation of whether loss contingencies exist primarily relates to litigation matters. The
 
outcome of 
litigation is
 
uncertain due
 
to, among
 
other things,
 
uncertainties regarding
 
the facts
 
will be
 
established during
 
the proceedings, 
uncertainties regarding
 
how the
 
law will
 
be applied
 
to the
 
facts established,
 
and uncertainties
 
regarding the
 
calculation of
 
any 
potential damages or
 
the costs of
 
any potential injunctive
 
relief. If the
 
facts discovered or
 
the Company’s
 
assumptions change, 
future
 
accruals
 
for
 
loss
 
contingencies
 
may
 
be
 
required.
 
Results
 
of
 
operations
 
may
 
be
 
materially
 
affected
 
by
 
losses
 
or
 
a
 
loss 
contingency accrual resulting from adverse legal proceedings. 
INCOME TAXES 
We
 
determine our effective tax
 
rate by estimating our
 
permanent differences resulting from
 
differing treatment of
 
items for tax 
and accounting purposes. Judgment and uncertainty
 
exist with management’s application of tax regulations

more-likely-than-not recognition and measurement thresholds. We are periodically audited by taxing authorities. An adverse tax

ITEM 7A.
 
QUANTITATIVE
 
AND QUALITATIVE
 
DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKS 
 
COMMODITY PRICE RISK 
Our primary exposure to
 
market risk arises from
 
changes in the prices
 
of conventional eggs, which
 
are subject to significant
 
price 
fluctuations that are largely beyond our control. We are focused on growing our specialty shell egg business, in part because the 
selling prices of
 
specialty shell eggs
 
are generally not
 
as volatile as
 
conventional shell egg
 
prices. Our exposure to
 
market risk 
also includes changes in the
 
prices of corn and soybean
 
meal, which are commodities subject
 
to significant price fluctuations due 
to market conditions that are largely beyond our control. To ensure continued availability of feed ingredients, we may enter
 
into 
contracts for future purchases of
 
corn and soybean meal, and
 
as part of these contracts,
 
we may lock-in the basis
 
portion of our 
grain purchases several months in advance and commit to purchase organic ingredients to help assure
 
supply. Ordinarily,
 
we do 
not enter long-term
 
contracts beyond a
 
year to purchase
 
corn and soybean
 
meal or hedge
 
against increases in
 
the price of
 
corn 
and soybean meal. The following
 
table outlines the impact of
 
price changes for corn
 
and soybean meal on feed

INTEREST RATE
 
RISK 
We
 
have
 
a
 
$250 million
 
Credit
 
Facility,
 
borrowings
 
under
 
which
 
would
 
bear
 
interest
 
at
 
variable
 
rates.
 
No
 
amounts
 
were 
outstanding under that facility during fiscal
 
2025 or fiscal 2024. Under our current
 
policies, we do not use interest
 
rate derivative 
instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate changes. 
FIXED INCOME SECURITIES RISK 
At May 31, 2025, the effective maturity of our cash equivalents and investment securities available for sale was 8.6 months, and 
the composite credit
 
rating of the
 
holdings are A+
 
/ A1 /
 
A+ (S&P /
 
Moody’s /
 
Fitch). Generally speaking,
 
rising interest rates 
decrease
 
the
 
value
 
of
 
fixed
 
income
 
securities
 
portfolios.
 
As
 
of
 
May
 
31,
 
2025,
 
the
 
estimated
 
fair
 
value
 
of
 
our
 
fixed
 
income 
securities portfolio was
 
approximately $892.7 million
 
and reflected net
 
unrealized losses of
 
approximately $149 thousand.

Statements. 
CONCENTRATION
 
OF CREDIT RISK 
Our financial instruments exposed to concentrations of
 
credit risk consist primarily of trade receivables.
 
Concentrations of credit 
risk with respect
 
to receivables are
 
limited due to
 
our large
 
number of customers
 
and their dispersion
 
across geographic areas, 
except that at
 
May 31, 2025
 
and June 1,
 
2024, 28.1% and
 
26.8%, respectively,
 
of our net
 
accounts receivable balance
 
was due 
from
 
Walmart
 
Inc.
 
(including
 
Sam’s
 
Club).
 
No
 
other
 
single
 
customer
 
or
 
customer
 
group
 
represented
 
10%
 
or
 
greater
 
of
 
net 
accounts receivable at May 31, 2025 and June 1, 2024.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 
AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA 
 
Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
Board of Directors and Stockholders 
Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. and Subsidiaries 
Ridgeland, Mississippi 
Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements 
We
 
have audited the
 
accompanying consolidated balance sheets
 
of Cal-Maine Foods,
 
Inc. and Subsidiaries
 
as of May 
31, 2025 and June 1,
 
2024, the related consolidated statements
 
of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’
 
equity, and cash 
flows for each of the three years in the period ended May 31, 2025, and
 
the related consolidated notes and schedule listed in the 
Index
 
at
 
Items
 
15(a)(1)
 
and
 
15(a)(2)
 
(collectively referred
 
to
 
as
 
the
 
“consolidated financial
 
statements”). In
 
our
 
opinion,
 
the 
consolidated
 
financial
 
statements
 
present
 
fairly,
 
in
 
all
 
material
 
respects,
 
the
 
financial
 
position
 
of
 
Cal-Maine
 
Foods,
 
Inc.
 
and 
Subsidiaries as of
 
May 31, 2025
 
and June 1,
 
2024, and the
 
results of their
 
operations and their
 
cash flows for
 
each of the
 
three 
years in
 
the period
 
ended May
 
31, 2025,
 
in conformity
 
with accounting
 
principles generally
 
accepted in
 
the United
 
States of 
America. 
We
 
also have
 
audited, in
 
accordance with
 
the standards
 
of the
 
Public Company
 
Accounting Oversight
 
Board (United 
States) (“PCAOB”),
 
the Cal-Maine
 
Foods, Inc.
 
and Subsidiaries’ internal
 
control over
 
financial reporting
 
as of
 
May 31,
 
2025, 
based
 
on
 
the
 
criteria
 
established
 
in
 
2013
 
Internal
 
Control
 
–
 
Integrated
 
Framework
 
issued
 
by
 
the
 
Committee
 
of
 
Sponsoring 
Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated July 22, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion. 
Basis for Opinion 
These
 
consolidated
 
financial
 
statements
 
are
 
the
 
responsibility
 
of
 
the
 
entities’
 
management.
 
Our
 
responsibility
 
is
 
to 
express an
 
opinion on
 
these consolidated
 
financial statements
 
based on
 
our audits.
 
We
 
are a
 
public accounting
 
firm registered 
with the PCAOB
 
and are required to be independent with respect
 
to Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. and Subsidiaries in accordance
 
with 
the U.S.
 
federal securities
 
laws and
 
the applicable
 
rules and
 
regulations of
 
the Securities
 
and Exchange
 
Commission and
 
the 
PCAOB. 
We
 
conducted our
 
audits in
 
accordance with
 
the standards
 
of the
 
PCAOB. Those
 
standards require
 
that we
 
plan and 
perform
 
the
 
audit
 
to
 
obtain
 
reasonable
 
assurance
 
about
 
whether
 
the
 
consolidated
 
financial
 
statements
 
are
 
free
 
of
 
material 
misstatement,
 
whether
 
due
 
to
 
error
 
or
 
fraud.
 
Our
 
audits
 
included
 
performing
 
procedures
 
to
 
assess
 
the
 
risks
 
of
 
material 
misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due
 
to error or fraud, and performing procedures
 
that respond to 
those
 
risks.
 
Such
 
procedures
 
included
 
examining,
 
on
 
a
 
test
 
basis,
 
evidence
 
regarding
 
the
 
amounts
 
and
 
disclosures
 
in
 
the 
consolidated financial
 
statements. Our
 
audits also
 
included evaluating
 
the accounting
 
principles used
 
and significant
 
estimates 
made by
 
management, as
 
well as
 
evaluating the
 
overall presentation
 
of the
 
consolidated financial
 
statements. We
 
believe our 
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
Critical Audit Matter
The
 
critical
 
audit
 
matter
 
communicated
 
below
 
is
 
a
 
matter
 
arising
 
from
 
the
 
current
 
period
 
audit
 
of
 
the
 
consolidated 
financial statements
 
that were
 
communicated or
 
required to
 
be
 
communicated to
 
the Audit
 
Committee and
 
that: (1)
 
relate to 
accounts or
 
disclosures that
 
are material
 
to the
 
consolidated financial
 
statements and
 
(2) involved
 
our especially
 
challenging, 
subjective, or complex
 
judgments. The communication of
 
the critical audit matter
 
does not alter
 
in any way our
 
opinion on the 
consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing 
a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
Contingent Liabilities – Litigation and Claims – Refer to Note 16 in the Consolidated Financial Statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. and Subsidiaries record liabilities for legal proceedings and
 
claims in those instances where they 
can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss and when the liability is probable. Where the reasonable estimate of the probable 
loss is a range, Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. and Subsidiaries record the most likely estimate of the
 
loss, or the low end of the range if 
there is no one
 
best estimate. Cal-Maine Foods,
 
Inc. and Subsidiaries either
 
disclose the amount
 
of a possible loss
 
or range of loss 








41 
in
 
excess
 
of
 
established
 
accruals
 
if
 
estimable,
 
or
 
states
 
that
 
such
 
an
 
estimate
 
cannot
 
be
 
made.
 
Cal-Maine
 
Foods,
 
Inc.
 
and 
Subsidiaries disclose significant legal proceedings
 
and claims even where liability
 
is not probable or
 
the amount of the liability 
is not
 
estimable, or
 
both, if
 
Cal-Maine Foods, Inc.
 
and Subsidiaries believe
 
there is
 
at least
 
a reasonable
 
possibility that
 
a loss 
may be incurred. 
We identified litigation and claims
 
as a critical
 
audit matter because
 
of the challenges
 
auditing management’s judgments 
applied
 
in
 
determining
 
the
 
likelihood
 
of
 
loss
 
related
 
to
 
the
 
resolution
 
of
 
such
 
claims.
 
Specifically,
 
auditing
 
management’s 
determination of whether
 
any contingent loss
 
arising from the
 
related litigation and
 
claims is probable,
 
reasonably possible, or 
remote, and the related disclosures, is subjective and requires significant judgment due to the sensitivity of the issue. 
How the Critical Audit Matter was addressed during the Audit 
Addressing the
 
matter involved
 
performing procedures
 
and evaluating
 
audit evidence
 
in connection
 
with forming
 
our 
overall
 
opinion
 
on
 
the
 
consolidated
 
financial
 
statements.
 
These
 
procedures
 
included
 
testing
 
the
 
effectiveness
 
of
 
the
 
controls 
relating to
 
the Cal-Maine
 
Foods, Inc.
 
and Subsidiaries’
 
evaluation of
 
the liability
 
related to
 
legal proceedings
 
and claims,
 
including 
controls over determining
 
the likelihood of
 
a loss and
 
whether the amount
 
of loss can
 
be reasonably estimated,
 
as well as
 
financial 
statement disclosures over the legal proceedings and claims. These procedures also included obtaining and evaluating the letters 
of audit inquiry
 
with external legal
 
counsel, evaluating the
 
reasonableness of Cal-Maine
 
Foods, Inc. and
 
Subsidiaries’ assessment 
regarding
 
whether
 
an
 
unfavorable
 
outcome
 
is
 
reasonably
 
possible
 
or
 
probable,
 
and
 
reasonably
 
estimable,
 
evaluating
 
the 
sufficiency of
 
Cal-Maine Foods,
 
Inc. and
 
Subsidiaries’ disclosures
 
related to
 
legal proceedings
 
and claims
 
and evaluating
 
the 
completeness and accuracy of Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. and Subsidiaries’ legal contingencies.

Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. and Subsidiaries 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
Nature of Operations 
Cal-Maine
 
Foods,
 
Inc.
 
(“we,”
 
“us,”
 
“our,”
 
or
 
the
 
“Company”)
 
is
 
primarily
 
engaged
 
in
 
the
 
production,
 
grading,
 
packaging, 
marketing and distribution of fresh shell eggs, including
 
conventional, cage-free, organic, brown, free-range, pasture-raised and 
nutritionally-enhanced eggs, as well
 
as egg products
 
and a variety of
 
prepared foods. The Company,
 
which is headquartered in 
Ridgeland, Mississippi, is the largest
 
producer and distributor of
 
fresh shell eggs in
 
the United States and
 
sells most of its
 
shell 
eggs throughout the majority of the United States.
Principles of Consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all wholly-owned subsidiaries and of majority-owned subsidiaries 
over which we exercise control. All significant intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated in consolidation.
Fiscal Year 
The Company’s fiscal year-end is on the Saturday closest to May 31. The fiscal years ending on May 31, 2025 and June 1, 2024 
included 
52
 
weeks and the fiscal year ended June 3, 2023 included 
53
 
weeks.
Use of Estimates 
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) 
in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the 
consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
 
Cash and Cash Equivalents 
The
 
Company
 
considers
 
all
 
highly
 
liquid
 
investments
 
with
 
a
 
maturity
 
of
 
three
 
months
 
or
 
less
 
when
 
purchased
 
to
 
be
 
cash 
equivalents.
 
We
 
maintain
 
bank
 
accounts
 
that
 
are
 
insured
 
by
 
the
 
Federal
 
Deposit
 
Insurance
 
Corporation
 
up
 
to
 
$
250,000
. The 
Company
 
routinely
 
maintains
 
cash
 
balances
 
with
 
certain
 
financial
 
institutions
 
in
 
excess
 
of
 
federally
 
insured
 
amounts.
 
The 
Company has not experienced any loss in such
 
accounts. The Company manages this risk through maintaining
 
cash deposits and 
other highly liquid investments in high quality financial institutions.
Investment Securities Available-for-Sale 
The Company has determined that its debt
 
securities are available-for-sale investments and are
 
classified as current because the 
amounts
 
invested
 
are
 
available for
 
current
 
operations.
 
Available-for-sale
 
securities
 
are
 
carried
 
at
 
fair
 
value,
 
based
 
on
 
quoted 
market
 
prices
 
as
 
of
 
the
 
balance
 
sheet
 
date,
 
with
 
unrealized
 
gains
 
and
 
losses
 
recorded
 
in
 
other
 
comprehensive
 
income.
 
The 
amortized cost of debt securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity and is recorded 
in interest income. The Company regularly evaluates changes to the rating of its debt securities
 
by credit agencies and economic 
conditions to
 
assess and
 
record any
 
expected credit
 
losses through
 
allowance for
 
credit losses,
 
limited to
 
the amount
 
that fair 
value was less than the amortized cost basis.
 
The cost basis
 
for realized gains
 
and losses on
 
available-for-sale securities is
 
determined by the
 
specific identification method. 
Gains and losses are
 
recognized in other income
 
(expense) as “Other, net” in
 
the Company’s Consolidated Statements of
 
Income. 
Interest
 
and
 
dividends
 
on
 
securities
 
classified
 
as
 
available-for-sale
 
are
 
recorded
 
in
 
“Interest
 
income”
 
in
 
the
 
Company’s 
Consolidated Statements of Income.
Trade Receivables
 
Trade receivables are stated at their
 
carrying values, which include a
 
reserve for credit losses. At
 
May 31, 2025 and June
 
1, 2024, 
reserves for credit losses were $
745
 
thousand and $
490
 
thousand, respectively. The Company extends credit to customers based 
on an
 
evaluation of
 
each customer’s
 
financial condition
 
and credit
 
history.
 
Collateral is
 
generally not
 
required. The
 
Company 
minimizes exposure to counter party credit
 
risk through credit analysis and
 
approvals, credit limits, and monitoring procedures. 
In determining
 
our reserve
 
for credit
 
losses, receivables
 
are assigned
 
an expected
 
loss based
 
on historical
 
loss information
 
adjusted 








48 
as
 
needed
 
for
 
economic
 
and
 
other
 
forward-looking
 
factors.
 
At
 
May
 
31,
 
2025
 
and
 
June
 
1,
 
2024, 
one
 
customer
 
accounted
 
for 
approximately 
28.1
% and 
26.8
% of the Company’s trade accounts receivable, respectively.
Inventories 
Inventories
 
of
 
eggs,
 
feed,
 
supplies
 
and flocks
 
are valued
 
principally
 
at
 
the
 
lower of
 
cost
 
or
 
net
 
realizable value.
 
The
 
cost
 
of 
inventories is determined by either the first-in, first-out method or the weighted-average method. 
The
 
cost
 
associated
 
with
 
flocks,
 
consisting
 
principally
 
of
 
chicks,
 
feed,
 
labor,
 
contractor
 
payments
 
and
 
overhead
 
costs,
 
are 
accumulated during a growing period of approximately 
22
 
weeks. Flock costs are amortized to cost of sales over
 
the productive 
lives of the flocks, generally 
one
 
to 
two years
. As the amortization period of the flocks is relatively short, disclosure of the gross 
cost and accumulated amortization is omitted. Flock mortality is charged to cost of sales as incurred.
Property, Plant and Equipment 
Property, plant
 
and equipment are stated
 
at cost. Depreciation is
 
provided by the straight-line
 
method over the estimated
 
useful 
lives, which
 
are 
15
 
to 
25
 
years for
 
buildings and
 
improvements and 
3
 
to 
12
 
years for
 
machinery and
 
equipment. Expenditures 
that significantly
 
extend the
 
useful life
 
of the
 
related assets
 
are capitalized.
 
Normal repairs
 
and maintenance
 
are expensed
 
as 
incurred. When property, plant, and equipment
 
are retired, sold, or
 
otherwise disposed of, the
 
asset’s carrying amount and related 
accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and
 
any gain or loss is included in
 
operations. When certain events or 
changes
 
in
 
operating
 
conditions
 
occur,
 
asset
 
lives
 
may
 
be
 
adjusted
 
and
 
an
 
impairment assessment
 
may
 
be
 
performed
 
on
 
the 
recoverability of the carrying amounts.
Investments in Unconsolidated Entities 
The equity method of accounting is
 
used when the Company can exert
 
significant influence over an entity,
 
but does not control 
its financial
 
and operating
 
decisions. Under
 
the equity
 
method, original
 
investments are
 
recorded at
 
cost and
 
adjusted by
 
the 
Company’s share of
 
undistributed earnings
 
or losses
 
of these
 
entities. Equity
 
investments without
 
readily determinable
 
fair values, 
when
 
the
 
Company
 
does
 
not
 
have
 
the
 
ability
 
to
 
exercise
 
significant
 
influence
 
over
 
the
 
investee,
 
are
 
recorded
 
at
 
cost,
 
less 
impairment, plus or minus observable price changes.
Goodwill 
Goodwill
 
represents
 
the
 
excess
 
of
 
the
 
purchase
 
price
 
over
 
the
 
fair
 
value
 
of
 
the
 
identifiable
 
net
 
assets
 
acquired.
 
Goodwill
 
is 
evaluated for
 
impairment at
 
least annually
 
or more
 
frequently if
 
impairment indicators
 
arise by
 
first performing
 
a qualitative 
assessment to determine whether a
 
quantitative goodwill test is necessary. After assessing
 
the totality of events
 
or circumstances, 
if we determine it is more likely than
 
not that the fair value of a
 
reporting unit is less than its carrying amount,
 
then we perform 
additional quantitative tests to determine the magnitude of any impairment.
 
Intangible Assets 
Intangible assets
 
are initially
 
recorded at
 
fair value
 
in business
 
acquisitions, which
 
include franchise
 
rights, customer
 
relationships, 
non-compete agreements, trademarks and right of
 
use intangibles. They are amortized over their
 
estimated useful lives of 
5
 
to 
15
years. The
 
gross
 
cost
 
and
 
accumulated
 
amortization
 
of
 
intangible
 
assets
 
are
 
removed
 
when
 
the
 
recorded
 
amounts
 
are
 
fully 
amortized and the
 
asset is no
 
longer in use
 
or the contract
 
has expired. When
 
certain events or
 
changes in operating
 
conditions 
occur, asset lives may
 
be adjusted and
 
an impairment assessment
 
may be performed
 
on the recoverability
 
of the carrying
 
amounts. 
Indefinite life assets are recorded at fair value in business acquisitions and represent water rights. They are not amortized, but 
are reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise.
Insurance Liabilities and Restricted Cash 
The
 
Company
 
uses
 
a
 
combination
 
of
 
insurance
 
and
 
self-insurance
 
programs,
 
including
 
a
 
wholly-owned
 
captive
 
insurance 
subsidiary (the “Captive”) to
 
provide coverage for the
 
potential liabilities for workers’
 
compensation, auto liability and general 
liability risks. Liabilities
 
associated with
 
these risks
 
that are retained
 
by the
 
Company are not
 
discounted and are
 
estimated, in 
part, by considering historical claims experience, severity
 
factors and other actuarial assumptions. These liabilities
 
are recorded 
within “Accrued
 
expenses and
 
other current
 
liabilities” in
 
the Company’s
 
Consolidated Balance
 
Sheets and
 
were $
8.0
 
million 
and $
4.9
 
million at May 31, 2025 and June 1, 2024, respectively. 








49 
The Captive maintains certain levels
 
of cash and cash
 
equivalents which are restricted in
 
use to secure the
 
insurer’s obligations 
for workers’ compensation, auto
 
liability and general liability
 
programs.
 
As of May
 
31, 2025, restricted cash
 
was $
1.0
 
million 
and is recorded within “Prepaid expenses and other current assets” in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
The Company also
 
maintains a medical plan
 
covering substantially all full-time
 
employees. Under the plan,
 
the Company self-
insures its
 
portion of
 
medical claims
 
and uses
 
stop-loss insurance
 
to limit
 
its portion
 
of medical
 
claims to
 
$
275,000
 
per occurrence. 
Liabilities
 
associated
 
with
 
these
 
risks
 
are
 
estimated
 
in
 
part
 
by
 
considering
 
historical
 
claims
 
experience,
 
medical
 
cost
 
trends, 
demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions.
 
The Company’s expenses including
 
accruals for incurred 
but not reported claims were
 
approximately $
22.8
 
million, $
23.0
 
million, and $
21.9
 
million in fiscal years 2025,
 
2024, and 2023, 
respectively. The
 
liability recorded for
 
incurred but not
 
reported claims was
 
$
3.0
 
million and $
2.8
 
million as of
 
May 31, 2025, 
and
 
June
 
1,
 
2024,
 
respectively
 
and
 
are
 
classified
 
within
 
“Accrued
 
expenses
 
and
 
other
 
current
 
liabilities”
 
in
 
the
 
Company’s 
Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Dividend Payable 
Dividends are accrued at the end of each quarter
 
according to the Company’s dividend
 
policy adopted by its Board of Directors 
(“Board”). The Company pays
 
a dividend to stockholders
 
of its Common Stock
 
on a quarterly basis
 
for each quarter for
 
which 
the Company reports net income attributable
 
to Cal-Maine Foods, Inc., computed in accordance
 
with GAAP, in an amount equal 
to 
one-third
 
(1/3) of such quarterly net income. Dividends are paid to stockholders
 
of record as of the 60th day following the last 
day of such
 
quarter, except
 
for the fourth
 
fiscal quarter.
 
For the fourth quarter,
 
the Company pays dividends
 
to stockholders of 
record on the 65th
 
day after the quarter
 
end. Dividends are
 
payable on the 15th
 
day following the
 
record date. Following a
 
quarter 
for which the Company does
 
not report net income attributable
 
to Cal-Maine Foods, Inc., the
 
Company will not pay a dividend 
for a
 
subsequent profitable
 
quarter until
 
the Company
 
is profitable
 
on a
 
cumulative basis
 
computed from
 
the date
 
of the
 
most 
recent quarter for which a dividend was paid. The dividend policy is subject to periodic review by the Board.
Revenue Recognition 
The Company
 
recognizes revenue
 
through sale
 
of its
 
products to
 
customers through
 
retail, foodservice
 
and other
 
distribution 
channels.
 
The
 
majority
 
of
 
the
 
Company’s
 
revenue
 
is
 
derived
 
from
 
agreements
 
or
 
contracts
 
with
 
customers
 
based
 
upon
 
the 
customer
 
ordering
 
its
 
products
 
with
 
a
 
single
 
performance
 
obligation
 
of
 
delivering
 
the
 
product.
 
The
 
Company
 
believes
 
the 
performance
 
obligation
 
is
 
met
 
upon
 
delivery
 
and
 
acceptance
 
of
 
the
 
product
 
by
 
our
 
customers,
 
which
 
generally
 
occurs
 
upon 
shipment or delivery
 
to a customer
 
based on terms of
 
the sale. Costs
 
paid to third
 
party brokers to
 
obtain agreements are
 
expensed 
as the Company’s agreements are generally less than one year. 
Revenues are
 
recognized in
 
an amount
 
that reflects
 
the net
 
consideration we
 
expect to
 
receive in
 
exchange for
 
delivery of
 
the 
products. The Company periodically
 
offers sales incentives or other
 
programs such as rebates,
 
discounts, coupons, volume-based 
incentives, guaranteed sales
 
and other programs.
 
The Company records
 
an estimated allowance
 
for costs associated
 
with these 
programs, which is recorded
 
as a reduction in
 
revenue at the time
 
of sale using historical
 
trends and projected redemption
 
rates 
of
 
each program.
 
The Company
 
regularly reviews
 
these estimates
 
and
 
any difference
 
between the
 
estimated costs
 
and actual 
realization of these programs would be recognized the subsequent period.
Shipping and Distribution 
Costs
 
to
 
deliver
 
product
 
to
 
customers
 
are
 
included
 
in
 
selling,
 
general
 
and
 
administrative
 
expenses
 
in
 
the
 
accompanying 
Consolidated Statements of
 
Income and totaled
 
$
93.5
 
million, $
72.7
 
million, and $
77.5
 
million in fiscal
 
years 2025, 2024,
 
and 
2023, respectively.
Income Taxes 
Income
 
taxes
 
are
 
accounted
 
for
 
using
 
the
 
liability
 
method.
 
Deferred
 
income
 
taxes
 
reflect
 
the
 
net
 
tax
 
effects
 
of
 
temporary 
differences
 
between
 
the
 
carrying
 
amounts
 
of
 
assets
 
and
 
liabilities
 
for
 
financial
 
reporting
 
purposes
 
and
 
the
 
amounts
 
used
 
for 
income tax
 
purposes. The Company’s policy
 
with respect
 
to evaluating
 
uncertain tax
 
positions is
 
based upon
 
whether management 
believes it
 
is more
 
likely than
 
not the
 
uncertain tax
 
positions will
 
be sustained
 
upon review
 
by the
 
taxing authorities. The
 
tax 
positions must meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold with consideration given to the amounts and probabilities of 
the outcomes
 
that could
 
be realized
 
upon settlement
 
using the
 
facts, circumstances
 
and information
 
at the
 
reporting date. The 
Company will
 
reflect only
 
the portion
 
of the
 
tax benefit
 
that will
 
be sustained
 
upon resolution
 
of the
 
position and
 
applicable 
interest on the portion of the tax benefit not recognized. The Company
 
initially and subsequently measures the largest amount of 
tax benefit
 
that is
 
greater than
 
50% likely
 
to be
 
realized upon
 
settlement with a
 
taxing authority that
 
has full
 
knowledge of
 
all 
relevant
 
information. The
 
Company
 
records
 
interest
 
and
 
penalties on
 
uncertain
 
tax
 
positions
 
as
 
a
 
component
 
of
 
income
 
tax 








50 
expense. Based upon
 
management’s assessment,
 
there are no
 
uncertain tax positions
 
expected to have
 
a material impact on
 
the 
Company’s consolidated financial statements.
Business Combinations 
The Company applies the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that once control is obtained, all
 
the assets acquired 
and liabilities assumed, including amounts
 
attributable to noncontrolling interests, are
 
recorded at their respective fair
 
values at 
the date of acquisition. We determine the fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities internally,
 
which requires estimates and 
the
 
use
 
of
 
various
 
valuation
 
techniques.
 
When
 
a
 
market
 
value
 
is
 
not
 
readily
 
available,
 
our
 
internal
 
valuation
 
methodology 
considers the remaining estimated life of the assets acquired and what management believes is the market value for those assets.
 
We
 
typically use the income method approach for intangible assets
 
acquired in a business combination. Significant estimates in 
valuing certain intangible
 
assets include, but
 
are not limited
 
to, the amount
 
and timing of
 
future cash flows,
 
growth rates, discount 
rates and
 
useful lives.
 
The excess
 
of the purchase
 
price over
 
fair values
 
of identifiable
 
assets and
 
liabilities is
 
recorded as
 
goodwill.
 
Gain (Loss) on Involuntary Conversions
 
The Company
 
maintains insurance
 
for both
 
property damage
 
and business
 
interruption relating
 
to catastrophic
 
events, such
 
as 
fires, hurricanes,
 
tornadoes and
 
other acts
 
of God,
 
and is
 
eligible to
 
participate in
 
U.S. Department
 
of Agriculture
 
(“USDA”) 
indemnity
 
and
 
compensation programs
 
for certain
 
losses due
 
to disease
 
outbreaks
 
such
 
as highly
 
pathogenic avian
 
influenza 
(“HPAI”). Specifically,
 
the Animal Health Protection Act authorizes the USDA to provide indemnity payments to producers for 
birds and eggs that
 
must be destroyed during
 
a disease response. Payments received under
 
these programs are based on
 
the fair 
market value of
 
the poultry and/or
 
eggs at the
 
time that HPAI
 
virus is detected
 
in the flock.
 
Other covered costs
 
include feed, 
depopulation and disposal
 
costs, and virus
 
elimination costs. The
 
USDA does not
 
provide indemnity for
 
income or production 
losses
 
suffered
 
due
 
to
 
downtime
 
or
 
other
 
business
 
disruptions
 
nor
 
for
 
indirect
 
continuing
 
expenses.
 
Recoveries
 
received
 
for 
property damage,
 
business interruption
 
and disease
 
outbreaks in
 
excess of
 
or less
 
than the
 
net book
 
value of
 
damaged assets, 
including poultry, clean-up and
 
demolition costs,
 
and other
 
direct post-event
 
costs are recorded
 
within “Gain (loss)
 
on involuntary 
conversions” in the period received or committed when all contingencies associated with the recoveries are resolved.
 
Loss Contingencies 
Certain conditions
 
may exist
 
as of
 
the date
 
the consolidated
 
financial statements
 
are issued
 
that may
 
result in
 
a loss
 
to the
 
Company 
but which will only be resolved
 
when one or more future events
 
occur or fail to occur. The Company’s management and its legal 
counsel assess
 
such contingent
 
liabilities, and
 
such assessment
 
inherently involves
 
an exercise
 
of judgment.
 
In assessing
 
loss 
contingencies related
 
to legal
 
proceedings that
 
are pending
 
against the
 
Company or
 
unasserted claims
 
that may
 
result in
 
such 
proceedings, the Company’s
 
legal counsel evaluates the
 
perceived merits of any
 
legal proceedings or unasserted claims
 
as well 
as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought therein. 
If the assessment
 
of a contingency
 
indicates it is
 
probable that a
 
material loss has
 
been incurred and
 
the amount of
 
the liability 
can be estimated, the estimated liability would be accrued in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. If the assessment 
indicates a
 
potentially material
 
loss contingency
 
is not
 
probable, but
 
is reasonably
 
possible, or
 
is probable
 
but cannot
 
be estimated, 
then the
 
nature of
 
the contingent
 
liability,
 
together with
 
an estimate of
 
the range of
 
possible loss
 
if determinable
 
and material, 
would be disclosed. Loss
 
contingencies considered remote are generally
 
not disclosed unless they
 
involve guarantees, in which 
case the nature of the guarantee would be disclosed.
 
The Company expenses the costs of litigation as they are incurred.
 


New Accounting Pronouncements and Policies 
In November 2023,
 
the Financial Accounting Standards

Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures
. This ASU requires enhanced disclosures 
about significant
 
segment expenses
 
regularly provided
 
to the
 
chief operating
 
decision maker
 
that are
 
included within
 
each reported 
measure of segment profit or
 
loss, and requires all
 
annual disclosures currently required by
 
Topic 280
 
to be included in
 
interim 
periods. The Company adopted ASU 2023-07 effective
 
fiscal year 2025. The pronouncement was adopted retrospectively
 
to all 
prior periods presented. For additional information, refer to 
Note 15 - Segment Reporting

Intangible
 
assets
 
consisted
 
primarily
 
of
 
water
 
rights
 
within
 
the
 
property
 
acquired.
 
Water
 
rights
 
were

three-year
 
period, commencing
 
on
 
the date
 
of
 
the 








 


 


 


 


 


 


 


 


 


53 
acquisition. The initial
 
fair value of the
 
contingent consideration was
 
estimated using a
 
discounted cash flow model.
 
This liability 
is recorded within “Other liabilities” in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
Goodwill represents the excess of the
 
purchase price of the acquired
 
business over the acquisition date fair
 
value of the net assets 
acquired. Goodwill
 
recorded in
 
connection with
 
the Fassio
 
acquisition is
 
primarily attributable
 
to improved
 
efficiencies from 
integrating the assets
 
of Fassio with
 
the operations of
 
the Company. The Company
 
recognized goodwill of
 
$
1.8
 
million as a
 
result 
of the acquisition.

Note 4 - Fair Value Measures 
 
The Company
 
is required
 
to categorize
 
both financial
 
and nonfinancial
 
assets and
 
liabilities based
 
on the
 
following fair
 
value 
hierarchy. The
 
fair value
 
of an
 
asset is
 
the price
 
at which
 
the asset
 
could be
 
sold in
 
an orderly
 
transaction between
 
unrelated, 
knowledgeable, and willing parties able to engage in the
 
transaction. A liability’s fair value
 
is defined as the amount that would 
be paid to transfer the liability to a new obligor in a transaction between such parties, not the amount
 
that would be paid to settle 
the liability with the creditor. 








 


 


 


 


 


 


 


 


54 
 


●
Level 1
 
- Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
●
Level 2
 
- Inputs
 
other than
 
quoted prices
 
included in
 
Level 1
 
that are
 
observable for
 
the asset
 
or liability,
 
either 
directly or indirectly, including: 
o
Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets 
o
Quoted prices for identical or similar assets in non-active markets 
o
Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability 
o
Inputs derived principally from or corroborated by other observable market data 
●
Level 3
 
- Unobservable inputs for
 
the asset or liability
 
supported by little or
 
no market activity and
 
are significant 
to the fair value of the assets or liabilities 
 
The disclosure of fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities recorded at cost are as follows: 
Cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable:
 
The carrying amount approximates fair value due to the 
short maturity of these instruments.
Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value
 
on a Recurring Basis 
In accordance with the fair value hierarchy
 
described above, the following table shows the
 
fair value of our financial assets and 
liabilities that are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of May 31, 2025 and June 1, 2024 (in thousands):

Contingent
 
consideration
 
classified
 
as
 
Level
 
3
 
consists
 
of
 
the
 
potential
 
obligation
 
to
 
pay
 
an
 
earnout
 
to
 
the
 
sellers
 
of
 
Fassio 
contingent on the acquired business meeting
 
certain return on profitability milestones over
 
a 
three-year
 
period, commencing on 
the date of the acquisition. The
 
fair value of the contingent consideration
 
is estimated using a discounted cash
 
flow model. Key 
assumptions and
 
unobservable inputs
 
that require
 
significant judgement
 
used in
 
the estimate
 
include weighted
 
average cost
 
of 
capital, egg prices, projected revenue
 
and expenses over the period
 
for which the contingent consideration
 
is measured, and the 
probability assessments with respect to the likelihood of achieving the
 
forecasted projections. See further discussion in 
Note 2 -
Acquisition
.
The following table shows the beginning and ending balances in fair value of the contingent consideration:

Note 9 - Employee Benefit Plans 
KSOP 
The Company
 
has a
 
KSOP plan
 
that covers
 
substantially all
 
of the
 
Company’s
 
employees (the
 
“Plan”). The Company
 
makes 
contributions
 
to the
 
Plan at
 
a
 
rate
 
of 
3
% of
 
participants’ eligible
 
compensation, plus
 
an additional
 
amount determined
 
at
 
the 
discretion
 
of
 
the
 
Board. Contributions
 
can
 
be
 
made
 
in
 
cash
 
or
 
the
 
Company’s
 
Common
 
Stock,
 
and
 
vest
 
immediately. The 
Company’s cash contributions to the Plan were $
5.5
 
million, $
4.3
 
million, and $
4.3
 
million in fiscal years 2025, 2024 and 2023, 
respectively.
 
The Company did 
no
t make direct
 
contributions of the
 
Company’s
 
Common Stock in
 
fiscal years 2025,
 
2024, or 
2023. Dividends
 
on the
 
Company’s
 
Common Stock
 
are paid
 
to the
 
Plan in
 
cash. The Plan
 
acquires the
 
Company’s
 
Common 
Stock, which
 
is listed
 
on the
 
Nasdaq Global
 
Select Market,
 
by using
 
the dividends
 
and the
 
Company’s
 
cash contributions
 
to 
purchase
 
shares
 
in
 
the
 
public
 
markets. The
 
Plan
 
sells
 
Common
 
Stock
 
on
 
the
 
Nasdaq
 
to
 
pay
 
benefits
 
to
 
Plan 
participants. Participants
 
may
 
make
 
contributions
 
to
 
the
 
Plan
 
up
 
to
 
the
 
maximum
 
allowed
 
by
 
Internal
 
Revenue
 
Service 
regulations. The Company does not match participant contributions. 
Deferred Compensation and Other Postretirement Plans 
The Company maintains several deferred compensation and other
 
postretirement plans for certain officers and
 
a select group of 
management and
 
highly compensated
 
employees of
 
the Company.
 
The liability
 
recorded related
 
to these
 
agreements was $
4.1
million and $
3.8
 
million at May
 
31, 2025 and
 
June 1, 2024,
 
respectively and is
 
classified within “Accrued
 
expenses and other 
current liabilities”
 
and “Other
 
liabilities” in
 
the Company’s
 
Consolidated Balance
 
Sheets. The
 
related expense
 
for these
 
plans 
was $
1.5
 
million, $
1.2
 
million and $
752
 
thousand in fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Note 10 - Credit Facility 
 
For
 
fiscal
 
years
 
2025,
 
2024
 
and
 
2023,
 
interest
 
expense
 
was
 
$
612
 
thousand,
 
$
549
 
thousand,
 
and
 
$
583
 
thousand,
 
respectively, 
primarily related to commitment fees on the Credit Facility described below. 








58 
On November 15,
 
2021, we entered
 
into an Amended
 
and Restated Credit
 
Agreement (as amended,
 
the “Credit Agreement”)
 
with 
a five-year
 
term. The
 
Credit Agreement
 
provides for
 
a senior
 
secured revolving
 
credit facility
 
(the “Credit
 
Facility” or
 
“Revolver”) 
in an initial aggregate principal amount of up to $
250
 
million, which includes a $
15
 
million sublimit for the issuance of standby 
letters of credit and a $
15
 
million sublimit for swingline loans. The Credit Facility also includes an accordion feature permitting, 
with the consent of BMO Harris
 
Bank N.A. (the “Administrative Agent”), an increase
 
in the Credit Facility in the
 
aggregate up 
to $
200
 
million by
 
adding one
 
or more
 
incremental senior
 
secured term
 
loans or
 
increasing one
 
or more
 
times the
 
revolving 
commitments under the Revolver. 
No
 
amounts were borrowed under
 
the Credit Facility as
 
of May 31, 2025
 
or June 1,
 
2024 or 
during fiscal 2025 or fiscal 2024. The Company had $
4.7
 
million of outstanding standby letters of credit issued under the Credit 
Facility at May 31, 2025. 
On May 26, 2023, we
 
entered into the First Amendment
 
(the “First Amendment”) to the
 
Credit Agreement, which replaced the 
London Interbank Offered Rate interest rate benchmark with the secured overnight financing rate as administered
 
by the Federal 
Reserve Bank of New
 
York
 
or a successor
 
administrator of the secured
 
overnight financing rate
 
(“SOFR”). The interest rate
 
in 
connection with
 
loans made under
 
the Credit
 
Facility is
 
based on,
 
at the
 
Company’s
 
election, either
 
the Adjusted
 
Term
 
SOFR 
Rate plus the Applicable Margin or the
 
Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin. The
 
“Adjusted Term SOFR”
 
means with respect 
to any tenor, the per annum rate equal to the sum of (i) Term SOFR as defined in the Credit Agreement plus (ii) 
0.10
% (10 basis 
points); provided, if Adjusted
 
Term
 
SOFR determined as provided
 
above shall ever be
 
less than the Floor,
 
then Adjusted Term 
SOFR shall be deemed to
 
be the Floor. The “Floor” means the
 
rate per annum of interest
 
equal to 
0.00
%. The “Base Rate” means 
a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the highest of (a) the federal
 
funds rate plus 
0.50
% per annum, (b) the prime rate of interest 
established by the Administrative Agent,
 
and (c) the Adjusted Term
 
SOFR for a 
one
-month tenor plus 
1.00
%. The “Applicable 
Margin” means 
0.00
% to 
0.75
% per annum for Base Rate Loans
 
and 
1.00
% to 
1.75
% per annum for SOFR Loans,
 
in each case 
depending upon the Total Funded Debt to Capitalization Ratio for the Company at the quarterly pricing date. The Company will 
pay a commitment
 
fee on
 
the unused
 
portion of
 
the Credit
 
Facility payable
 
quarterly from 
0.15
% to 
0.25
%, in
 
each case
 
depending 
upon the Total Funded Debt to Capitalization Ratio for the Company at the quarterly pricing date.
 
The Credit
 
Facility is
 
guaranteed by
 
substantially all
 
the current
 
and future
 
wholly-owned direct
 
and indirect
 
domestic subsidiaries 
of
 
the
 
Company
 
(the
 
“Guarantors”),
 
and
 
is
 
secured
 
by
 
a
 
first-priority
 
perfected
 
security
 
interest
 
in
 
substantially
 
all
 
of
 
the 
Company’s and the
 
Guarantors’ accounts,
 
payment intangibles,
 
instruments (including
 
promissory notes),
 
chattel paper, inventory 
(including farm products) and deposit accounts maintained with the Administrative Agent. 
The Credit Agreement
 
contains customary covenants,
 
including restrictions on
 
the incurrence of
 
liens, incurrence of
 
additional 
debt, sales of
 
assets and other
 
fundamental corporate changes
 
and investments. The
 
Credit Agreement requires maintenance
 
of 
two financial covenants: (i) a maximum Total
 
Funded Debt to Capitalization Ratio tested quarterly
 
of no greater than 
50
%; and 
(ii) a requirement to maintain Minimum Tangible Net Worth
 
at all times of $
700
 
Million plus 
50
% of net income (if net income 
is positive) less permitted restricted payments for each fiscal quarter after November 27, 2021.
 
On March
 
25, 2025,
 
the Company
 
entered into
 
the Second
 
Amendment (the
 
“Second Amendment”)
 
to the
 
Credit Agreement. 
Under the
 
Credit Agreement,
 
a Change
 
of Control
 
is an
 
event of
 
default. The
 
Second Amendment
 
amended the
 
definition of 
Change of
 
Control to
 
exclude from
 
that definition
 
the conversion
 
(the “Class
 
A Conversion”)
 
of all
 
outstanding shares
 
of the 
Company’s Class A Common Stock into Common Stock which occurred on April 14, 2025. 
The Second
 
Amendment states
 
that after
 
the Class
 
A Conversion,
 
Change of
 
Control will
 
mean any
 
of the
 
following: (i)
 
the 
acquisition by
 
any “person”
 
or “group”
 
(as such
 
terms are
 
used in
 
sections 13(d)
 
and 14(d)
 
of the
 
Securities Exchange
 
Act of 
1934, as amended) at any
 
time of beneficial ownership
 
of 30.0% or more of
 
the outstanding capital stock
 
or other equity interests 
of the Company on a fully-diluted
 
basis, (ii) the failure of individuals
 
who are members of the
 
Board (or similar governing body) 
of the Company on
 
the effective date
 
of the Second
 
Amendment (together with any
 
new or replacement directors
 
whose initial 
nomination for election was approved
 
by a majority of the
 
directors who were either directors
 
on the effective date of the Second 
Amendment or previously so
 
approved) to constitute a
 
majority of the Board
 
(or similar governing body)
 
of the Company, or (iii) 
any “Change
 
of Control”
 
(or words
 
of like
 
import), as
 
defined in
 
any agreement
 
or indenture
 
relating to
 
any issue
 
of Material 
Indebtedness of any Loan Party or any Subsidiary of a Loan Party (each as defined in the Credit Agreement), shall occur. 
Further, under
 
the terms of
 
the Credit Agreement,
 
payment of dividends
 
under the Company’s
 
current dividend policy
 
of one-
third of the Company’s net income, computed in accordance
 
with GAAP,
 
and payment of other dividends or repurchases by the 
Company of its
 
capital stock is
 
allowed, as long
 
as after giving
 
effect to such
 
dividend payments or repurchases
 
no default has 
occurred and is continuing and the sum of cash and cash equivalents of the Company and its
 
subsidiaries plus availability under 
the Credit Facility equals at least $
50
 
million. 








59 
The Credit
 
Agreement also
 
includes customary
 
events of
 
default and
 
customary remedies
 
upon the
 
occurrence of
 
an event
 
of 
default, including acceleration of the amounts
 
due under the Credit Facility and
 
foreclosure of the collateral securing the
 
Credit 
Facility. 
At May 31, 2025, we were in compliance with the covenant requirements of the Credit Agreement.
Note 11 - Equity 
 
As of May 31, 2025, the Company’s authorized shares of capital stock consisted of 
120
 
million shares of Common Stock and 
10
million shares of preferred stock, par value $
0.01
 
per share. As of May 31, 2025, 
no
 
shares of preferred stock were outstanding. 
Prior to the conversion of all of the Company’s outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock into Common
 
Stock (the “Class A 
Conversion”), which
 
occurred on
 
April 14,
 
2025, the
 
Company had 
two
 
classes of
 
capital stock,
 
Common Stock
 
and Class
 
A 
Common Stock,
 
which were
 
similar in
 
most respects
 
except that
 
the Common
 
Stock had 
one
 
vote per
 
share and
 
the Class
 
A 
Common Stock
 
had 
10
 
votes per
 
share. In
 
addition, each
 
share of
 
Class A
 
Common Stock
 
was convertible
 
into 
one
 
share of 
Common Stock
 
at the
 
option of
 
the holder
 
at any
 
time, and,
 
generally,
 
would automatically
 
convert into
 
Common Stock upon 
transfer outside of the control of the family of Fred R.
 
Adams Jr., the Company’s
 
late founder. Prior to the
 
Class A Conversion, 
Mr. Adams’ family controlled all of the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock, all of which were held by
 
DLNL, LLC, a 
Delaware limited liability company
 
(“Daughters’ LLC”), and thereby
 
controlled a majority of
 
the Company’s total voting power; 
as a result, the Company was a “controlled company” under the rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market. 
On February 25, 2025, the Company
 
entered an Agreement Regarding Conversion
 
(the “Conversion Agreement”) by and among 
the Company, Daughters’ LLC
 
and its members,
 
namely Fred R. Adams
 
Jr.’s four daughters and Adolphus
 
B. Baker, Board
 
Chair 
and
 
Mr. Adams’
 
son-in-law (the
 
“Members” and
 
together with
 
Daughters’ LLC,
 
the
 
“Stockholder Parties”).
 
The
 
Company’s 
entry into the Conversion Agreement was
 
a result of the Members
 
informing the Company that they were
 
potentially interested 
in diversifying
 
their respective
 
financial portfolios,
 
including through
 
the potential
 
sale of
 
all or
 
a portion
 
of the
 
shares of
 
the 
Company’s
 
Common
 
Stock
 
underlying
 
the
 
Class
 
A
 
Common
 
Stock,
 
as
 
most
 
of
 
them
 
have
 
become
 
more
 
focused
 
on
 
their 
individual estate planning efforts and philanthropic endeavors.
 
The Conversion Agreement provided for the following: 
●
The approval by
 
the Board, and
 
approval by Daughters’
 
LLC by majority
 
written consent, of
 
the Third Amended
 
and 
Restated Certificate of
 
Incorporation of the
 
Company (“Third Amended
 
and Restated Charter”),
 
which became effective 
upon filing with the Delaware Secretary of State on March 27, 2025.
 
●
The approval
 
by the
 
Board of
 
the Amended
 
and Restated
 
Bylaws of
 
the Company,
 
which became
 
effective when
 
the 
Third Amended and Restated Charter became effective. 
●
The agreement by the Stockholder Parties not to convert any shares of Class A Common Stock into shares of Common 
Stock prior to the later of (i) the effective date of the Third Amended and Restated Charter or (ii) the date the
 
Company 
obtained an amendment to its Credit Agreement such that the Class A Conversion, defined below, would not result in a 
“Change of Control” within the meaning of the Credit Agreement. Both conditions were met on March 27, 2025. 
●
The agreement by the Stockholder Parties that if Daughters’ LLC converted any Class
 
A Common Stock into Common 
Stock,
 
it
 
would
 
simultaneously
 
convert
 
all
 
(but
 
not
 
less
 
than
 
all)
 
Class
 
A
 
Common
 
Stock
 
into
 
Common
 
Stock
 
(the 
“Class A Conversion”). 
●
After
 
the
 
effective
 
date
 
of
 
the
 
Class
 
A
 
Conversion
 
(the
 
“Class
 
A
 
Conversion
 
Date”),
 
and
 
ending
 
on
 
the
 
12-month 
anniversary
 
of
 
the
 
Class
 
A
 
Conversion
 
Date
 
(or,
 
if
 
earlier,
 
December 31, 2026),
 
certain
 
registration
 
rights
 
of
 
the 
Members to offer or sell Common
 
Stock in a registered offering under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. 
●
The adoption by the
 
Stockholder Parties of an
 
amended and restated limited
 
liability company operating agreement of 
Daughters’ LLC, which provided
 
for certain changes to
 
permit Daughters’ LLC to
 
take the actions provided
 
for in the 
Conversion Agreement. 
The Conversion Agreement, including the documents contemplated by that agreement, did
 
not require any Stockholder Party to 
convert Class A Common Stock into Common Stock or to sell any Common Stock. 
Also on
 
February 25, 2025,
 
the Board approved
 
a new $
500
 
million share repurchase
 
program. The share
 
repurchase program 
authorizes the Company, in management’s discretion, to repurchase Common Stock from time to time for
 
an aggregate purchase 
price up
 
to $
500
 
million (exclusive
 
of any
 
fees, taxes,
 
commissions or
 
other expenses
 
related to
 
such repurchases),
 
subject to 
market
 
conditions
 
and
 
other
 
factors.
 
The
 
actual
 
timing,
 
number
 
and
 
value
 
of
 
shares
 
repurchased
 
under
 
the
 
program
 
will
 
be 
determined by
 
management in
 
its discretion
 
and will
 
depend on
 
a number
 
of factors,
 
including, but
 
not limited
 
to, the
 
market 
price of the Common Stock and general market and economic conditions. 








 


 


 


60 
The Class A Conversion occurred on April 14, 2025, at which time the Company was no longer a controlled company under the 
rules of The
 
Nasdaq Stock Market.
 
On April 15,
 
2025, the Company
 
filed a Certificate
 
of Retirement with
 
the Delaware Secretary 
of
 
State,
 
retiring
 
the
 
Class
 
A
 
Common
 
Stock.
 
Promptly
 
thereafter,
 
the
 
Company
 
filed
 
the
 
Fourth
 
Amended
 
and
 
Restated 
Certificate of Incorporation with
 
the Delaware Secretary of
 
State, which became effective
 
upon filing, reflecting the
 
retirement 
of the Class A Common Stock. 
On April 15, 2025,
 
in connection with the
 
offer and sale (the “Offering”)
 
of 
2,978,740
 
shares of Common Stock
 
by the Members, 
the Company entered into
 
a stock repurchase agreement
 
with the Members, pursuant
 
to which the Company
 
agreed to repurchase 
551,876
 
shares
 
of
 
Common
 
Stock
 
(the
 
“Repurchased
 
Shares”),
 
which
 
were
 
not
 
included
 
in
 
the
 
Offering,
 
contingent
 
upon 
completion of the
 
Offering, at the
 
per share price
 
paid by the
 
underwriter in the
 
Offering, resulting in
 
a total purchase
 
price of 
approximately $
50
 
million. The
 
Offering and
 
the Company’s purchase
 
of the
 
Repurchased Shares
 
pursuant to
 
the stock
 
repurchase 
agreement were completed on 
April 17, 2025
. The Company incurred expenses of $
1.7
 
million in connection with the Offering. 
Pursuant to the Conversion Agreement, the Selling Stockholders will reimburse the Company $
826
 
thousand. 
As of May 31, 2025, no shares other than the Repurchased Shares had
 
been repurchased under the Company’s share repurchase 
program, leaving $
450
 
million available under the program.
 
Note 12 - Net Income per Common Share 
Basic net income per share attributable
 
to Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. is based on
 
the weighted average Common Stock and Class
 
A 
Common Stock
 
outstanding. All
 
shares of
 
Class A
 
Common Stock
 
were converted
 
into Common
 
Stock on
 
April 14,
 
2025. Diluted 
net income per share attributable to Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. is based on weighted-average Common Stock outstanding during the 
relevant period adjusted for the dilutive effect of share-based awards.
 
The following table provides
 
a reconciliation of the
 
numerators and denominators
 
used to determine basic

Note 13 – Stock-Based Compensation 
The Company’s
 
stock-based compensation plan,
 
the Amended and
 
Restated Cal-Maine Foods,
 
Inc. 2012 Omnibus
 
Long-Term 
Incentive Plan (the
 
“LTIP
 
Plan”), provides for
 
the granting of
 
equity-based awards such
 
as restricted stock,
 
performance stock 
units and stock options. Awards may be granted under the LTIP
 
Plan to any employee, any non-employee member of the Board, 
and any
 
consultant who
 
is a
 
natural person
 
and provides
 
services to
 
us or
 
one of
 
our subsidiaries
 
(except for
 
incentive stock 
options, which may be granted only to our employees). The maximum number of shares of Common Stock available for awards 
under the
 
LTIP
 
Plan is 
2,000,000
 
of which 
813,298
 
shares remained
 
available for
 
issuance as
 
of May
 
31, 2025,
 
and may
 
be 
authorized but unissued shares or treasury shares. Common Stock issued from treasury shares under the plan was 
47,700
 
shares, 
86,803
 
shares and 
84,969
 
shares for fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
 








 


 


 


 


 


61 
 


Restricted Stock 
Restricted stock
 
outstanding under
 
the LTIP
 
Plan vests
 
three years
 
from the
 
grant date,
 
or upon
 
death or
 
disability,
 
change in 
control, or retirement (subject to certain requirements). The restricted stock contains
 
no other service or performance conditions. 
Restricted stock is awarded in
 
the name of the recipient
 
and, except for the right
 
of disposal, constitutes issued and
 
outstanding 
shares of the Company’s Common Stock for all corporate purposes during the period of restriction including the right to receive 
dividends. Compensation expense is
 
a fixed amount based
 
on the grant date
 
closing price and is
 
amortized on a straight-line
 
basis 
over the vesting period. Forfeitures are recognized as they occur. 
Total
 
stock-based
 
compensation
 
expense
 
was
 
$
4.5
 
million,
 
$
4.4
 
million,
 
and
 
$
4.2
 
million
 
in
 
fiscal
 
2025,
 
2024,
 
and
 
2023, 
respectively. 
Our unrecognized compensation expense as
 
a result of non-vested
 
shares was $
8.0
 
million at May 31,
 
2025 and $
7.5
 
million at 
June 1,
 
2024. The unrecognized
 
compensation expense
 
will be
 
amortized to
 
stock compensation
 
expense over
 
a period
 
of 2.1 
years. 
A summary of our equity award activity and related information for our restricted stock is as follows:

Note 15 – Segment Reporting 
 
The
 
Company
 
has 
one
 
operating
 
and 
one
 
reportable
 
segment,
 
which
 
is
 
the
 
production,
 
grading,
 
packaging,
 
marketing
 
and 
distribution of shell eggs and egg products. The Company is managed on a consolidated basis.
 
The Company’s
 
operating segment
 
is determined
 
on the
 
basis of
 
our organizational
 
structure and
 
information that
 
is regularly 
reviewed by our
 
Chief Operating Decision Maker
 
(“CODM”). The Company’s
 
CODM is Sherman Miller,
 
President and Chief 
Executive Officer.
 
The CODM reviews
 
net income, which
 
is reported on
 
the Consolidated Statements of
 
Income, to assess
 
the 
performance
 
and
 
make
 
decisions
 
on
 
how
 
to
 
allocate
 
resources
 
to
 
the
 
segment.
 
The
 
CODM
 
utilizes
 
consolidated
 
expense 
information regularly provided in the CODM
 
package in order to assist with assessing
 
performance and deciding how to allocate 
resources,
 
which
 
align
 
with
 
the
 
consolidated
 
expense
 
categories
 
as
 
disclosed
 
on
 
the
 
face
 
of
 
the
 
Consolidated
 
Statements
 
of 
Income. The measure of segment assets is reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as Total assets.
 
Revenue primarily derives from the sales of shell eggs and egg products throughout the Unites States. The Company’s shell egg 
product offerings
 
include specialty
 
and
 
conventional shell
 
eggs.
 
Specialty shell
 
eggs include
 
cage-free, organic,
 
brown, free-
range, pasture-raised and nutritionally enhanced
 
eggs. Conventional shell eggs
 
sales represent all other shell
 
egg sales not sold as 
specialty
 
shell
 
eggs.
 
The
 
Company’s
 
egg
 
products
 
offerings
 
include
 
liquid
 
and
 
frozen
 
egg
 
products,
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
ready-to-eat 
products
 
such
 
as
 
hard-cooked
 
eggs,
 
egg
 
wraps,
 
protein
 
pancakes,
 
crepes
 
and
 
wrap-ups.
 
Other
 
sales
 
represent
 
feed
 
sales, 
miscellaneous byproducts and resale products.

State of Texas v.
 
Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. d/b/a Wharton; and Wharton County Foods, LLC
 
On April 23, 2020, the Company
 
and its subsidiary Wharton County Foods,
 
LLC (“WCF”) were named as defendants
 
in State of 
Texas v.
 
Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. d/b/a Wharton; and Wharton
 
County Foods, LLC, Cause No. 2020-25427, in
 
the District Court 
of Harris County, Texas.
 
The State of Texas (the “State”) asserted claims based on the Company’s
 
and WCF’s alleged violation 
of the
 
Texas
 
Deceptive Trade
 
Practices—Consumer Protection
 
Act, Tex.
 
Bus. &
 
Com. Code
 
§§ 17.41-17.63
 
(“DTPA”).
 
The 
State claimed
 
that the
 
Company and
 
WCF offered
 
shell eggs
 
at excessive
 
or exorbitant
 
prices during
 
the COVID-19
 
state of 
emergency and made
 
misleading statements
 
about shell
 
egg prices.
 
The State
 
sought temporary
 
and permanent
 
injunctions against 
the Company and WCF to prevent further alleged violations of the DTPA, along with over $
100,000
 
in damages. On August 13, 
2020, the
 
court granted the
 
defendants’ motion to
 
dismiss the State’s
 
original petition with
 
prejudice. On September
 
11, 2020, 
the State filed a notice
 
of appeal, which was assigned
 
to the Texas
 
Court of Appeals for the
 
First District. On August 16,
 
2022, 
the
 
appeals
 
court
 
reversed
 
and
 
remanded
 
the
 
case
 
back
 
to
 
the
 
trial
 
court
 
for
 
further
 
proceedings.
 
On
 
October
 
31,
 
2022,
 
the 
Company and
 
WCF appealed
 
the First
 
District Court’s
 
decision to
 
the Supreme
 
Court of
 
Texas.
 
On September
 
29, 2023,
 
the 
Supreme Court of Texas denied the Company’s
 
Petition for Review and remanded to the trial court for further proceedings. The 
district court entered an order scheduling pre-trial proceedings and a
 
pre-trial conference for August 11, 2025. On November 30, 
2024, the State filed an amended petition, primarily to address
 
a procedural deficiency that required the State to generally plead 
it
 
was
 
seeking
 
monetary
 
relief
 
over
 
$
1.0
 
million
 
including
 
restitution,
 
civil
 
penalties,
 
attorney’s
 
fees
 
and
 
costs.
 
Pre-trial 
proceedings are progressing
 
in accordance with
 
the court’s schedule. Management believes
 
the risk of
 
material loss related
 
to this 
matter to be remote. 
Kraft Foods Global, Inc. et al. v. United Egg Producers, Inc. et al.
 
On September 25,
 
2008, the Company
 
was named as
 
one of
 
several defendants in
 
numerous antitrust cases
 
involving the U.S. 
shell
 
egg
 
industry.
 
The Company
 
settled all
 
of
 
these cases,
 
except for
 
the claims
 
of
 
certain plaintiffs
 
who sought
 
substantial 
damages allegedly arising
 
from the purchase
 
of egg products
 
(as opposed to
 
shell eggs). These
 
remaining plaintiffs are
 
Kraft Food 
Global, Inc.,
 
General Mills,
 
Inc., and
 
Nestle USA,
 
Inc. (the
 
“Egg Products
 
Plaintiffs”) and,
 
until a
 
subsequent settlement
 
was 
reached as described below, The Kellogg Company. 
On September 13, 2019, the
 
case with the Egg Products
 
Plaintiffs was remanded from a multi-district
 
litigation proceeding in the 
United States District
 
Court for the
 
Eastern District of

Plaintiffs alleged that
 
the Company
 
and other
 
defendants 
violated Section 1 of the
 
Sherman Act, 15. U.S.C. §
 
1, by agreeing to limit
 
the production of eggs and
 
thereby illegally to raise 
the prices that plaintiffs paid for
 
processed egg products. In particular, the Egg
 
Products Plaintiffs attacked certain features
 
of the 
United Egg Producers animal-welfare guidelines and program used by the Company and many other egg producers.
 
On October 24, 2019, the Company entered into a
 
confidential settlement agreement with The Kellogg Company dismissing all 
claims against the Company
 
for an amount that
 
did not have
 
a material impact on
 
the Company’s
 
financial condition or results 
of operations.
 
On November
 
11,
 
2019, a
 
stipulation for
 
dismissal was
 
filed with
 
the court,
 
and on
 
March 28,
 
2022, the
 
court 
dismissed the Company with prejudice. 
The trial of this case began on October 17, 2023. On December 1, 2023, the jury returned a decision awarding the
 
Egg Products 
Plaintiffs $
17.8
 
million in damages. On
 
November 6, 2024, the
 
court entered a final
 
judgement against the Company and
 
other 
defendants, jointly
 
and severally, totaling
 
$
43.6
 
million after
 
trebling. On
 
December 4,
 
2024, the
 
Company filed
 
a renewed
 
motion 
for judgment as a
 
matter of law or
 
for a new trial,
 
and a motion to alter
 
or amend the judgment.
 
On December 13, 2024,
 
the court 
granted defendants’ November 20,
 
2024 motion to stay
 
enforcement of the judgment
 
and entered an agreed
 
order requiring the 
defendants to post security during post-judgment
 
proceedings and appeal, and stayed proceedings
 
to enforce the judgment until 
the disposition of
 
the post-judgment motions
 
and ultimate appeals.
 
On December 17,
 
2024, the Company
 
posted a bond
 
in the 
approximate amount of
 
$
23.9
 
million, representing
 
a portion
 
of the
 
total bond
 
required to
 
preserve the
 
right to
 
appeal the
 
trial 
court’s
 
decision. Another
 
defendant posted
 
a bond
 
for the
 
remaining amount.
 
The Company
 
intends to
 
continue to
 
vigorously 
defend the claims asserted by the Egg Products Plaintiffs. 








65 
 


 


If the
 
jury’s
 
decision is
 
ultimately upheld,
 
the Company
 
would be
 
jointly and
 
severally liable
 
with other
 
defendants for
 
treble 
damages,
 
or
 
$
43.6
 
million,
 
subject
 
to
 
credit
 
for
 
certain
 
settlements
 
with
 
previous
 
settling
 
defendants,
 
plus
 
the
 
Egg
 
Product 
Plaintiffs’ reasonable attorneys’ fees. During our
 
second fiscal quarter of 2024,
 
we recorded an accrued expense
 
of $
19.6
 
million 
in selling, general and administrative expenses
 
in the Company’s
 
Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and classified 
as other noncurrent liabilities in the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Although less than the
 
bond posted by 
the
 
Company,
 
the
 
accrual
 
represents
 
our
 
estimate
 
of
 
the
 
Company’s
 
proportional
 
share
 
of
 
the
 
reasonably
 
possible
 
ultimate 
damages award, excluding
 
the Egg Product
 
Plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees
 
that we believe
 
would be approximately
 
offset by the
 
credits 
noted above. We have entered into a judgment allocation and joint defense agreement
 
with the other defendants remaining in the 
case. Our accrual may change in the future to the extent we are successful in further proceedings in the litigation.
 
State of Oklahoma Watershed Pollution Litigation 
On June
 
18, 2005, the
 
State of Oklahoma
 
filed suit, in
 
the United States
 
District Court for
 
the Northern District
 
of Oklahoma, 
against Cal-Maine Foods, Inc.
 
and Tyson Foods, Inc., Cobb-Vantress, Inc., Cargill, Inc., George’s, Inc., Peterson Farms, Inc. and 
Simmons Foods, Inc., and certain of their affiliates. The State of Oklahoma claims that through the disposal of chicken litter the 
defendants polluted
 
the Illinois
 
River Watershed.
 
This watershed
 
provides water
 
to eastern
 
Oklahoma. The
 
complaint sought 
injunctive relief and monetary damages, but the claim for monetary damages was dismissed by the court. Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. 
discontinued operations in the watershed
 
in or around 2005. Since
 
the litigation began, Cal-Maine Foods,
 
Inc. purchased 
100
% 
of the
 
membership interests
 
of Benton
 
County Foods,
 
LLC, which
 
is an
 
ongoing commercial
 
shell egg
 
operation within
 
the Illinois 
River
 
Watershed.
 
Benton
 
County
 
Foods,
 
LLC
 
is
 
not
 
a
 
defendant
 
in
 
the
 
litigation.
 
We
 
also
 
have
 
a
 
number
 
of
 
small
 
contract 
producers that operate in the area. 
The non-jury trial in the case began in September 2009 and concluded in February 2010. On January 18, 2023, the court entered 
findings of fact
 
and conclusions of
 
law in favor
 
of the State
 
of Oklahoma, but
 
no penalties were
 
assessed. The court
 
found the 
defendants liable for state
 
law nuisance, federal
 
common law nuisance, and
 
state law trespass. The
 
court also found the
 
producers 
vicariously liable for
 
the actions of
 
their contract producers.
 
On June
 
12, 2023,
 
the court ordered
 
the parties to
 
mediate before 
retired Tenth Circuit Chief Judge Deanell Reece Tacha, but the mediation was unsuccessful. On June 26, 2024, the district court 
denied defendants’
 
motion to
 
dismiss the
 
case. On
 
September 13,
 
2024, a
 
status hearing
 
was held
 
and the
 
court scheduled
 
an 
evidentiary hearing
 
for December
 
3, 2024,
 
to determine
 
whether any
 
legal remedy
 
is available
 
based on
 
the now
 
14 year
 
old 
record and changed circumstances of the Illinois River watershed.
 
On June 17, 2025, the court entered an opinion and
 
order that 
found that the State satisfied its burden to show that conditions in the Illinois River watershed have not materially changed since 
the original
 
trial and
 
the case
 
in not
 
moot. The
 
court instructed
 
the parties
 
to submit
 
proposed forms
 
of final
 
judgment. While 
management believes there
 
is a
 
reasonable possibility of
 
a material loss
 
from the
 
case, at
 
the present
 
time, it
 
is not
 
possible to 
estimate the
 
amount of
 
monetary exposure,
 
if any,
 
to the
 
Company due
 
to a
 
range of
 
factors, including
 
the following,
 
among 
others: uncertainties inherent in any
 
assessment of potential costs associated
 
with injunctive relief or
 
other penalties based on
 
a 
decision in a case tried
 
over 14 years ago based
 
on environmental conditions that existed at
 
the time, the lack of
 
guidance from 
the court as to
 
what might be
 
considered appropriate remedies,
 
the ongoing litigation
 
with the State
 
of Oklahoma, and
 
uncertainty 
regarding
 
what
 
our
 
proportionate
 
share
 
of
 
any
 
remedy
 
would
 
be,
 
although
 
we
 
believe
 
that
 
our
 
share
 
compared
 
to
 
the
 
other 
defendants is small. 
Other Matters 
In addition to the above,
 
the Company is involved in
 
various other claims and litigation
 
incidental to its business. Although
 
the 
outcome of these matters
 
cannot be determined with
 
certainty, management, upon the advice of
 
counsel, is of the
 
opinion that the 
final outcome should not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations or financial position.
Note 17 – Subsequent Events 
Effective June 2, 2025, the Company completed its previously announced acquisition of Echo Lake Foods, LLC (formerly Echo 
Lake Foods,
 
Inc.) and
 
certain related
 
companies (collectively
 
“Echo Lake
 
Foods”). Echo
 
Lake Foods
 
is based
 
in Burlington, 
Wisconsin and produces, packages, markets and distributes prepared foods, including waffles, pancakes, scrambled eggs, frozen 
cooked omelets, egg patties,
 
toast and diced eggs.
 
The purchase price was
 
approximately $
258
 
million, excluding expected tax 
assets resulting from the transaction, and was funded with available cash on hand. 
The Company has not included
 
certain disclosures due to
 
the timing of the
 
transaction relative to the
 
date of the report containing 
these Financial Statements and because the initial accounting for the business combination is incomplete.

Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
(a)
 
Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
The following sets
 
forth, in accordance
 
with Section 404(a)
 
of the Sarbanes-Oxley
 
Act of 2002
 
and Item 308
 
of the Securities 
and Exchange Commission’s Regulation S-K, the report of management on our internal control over financial reporting. 
1.
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
 
control over financial reporting. 
“Internal control over
 
financial reporting” is
 
a process designed
 
by, or under the supervision
 
of, our Chief
 
Executive 
Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
 
together with other financial officers, and effected by the Board, management 
and
 
other
 
personnel,
 
to
 
provide
 
reasonable
 
assurance
 
regarding
 
the
 
reliability
 
of
 
financial
 
reporting
 
and
 
the 
preparation
 
of
 
financial
 
statements
 
for
 
external
 
purposes
 
in
 
accordance
 
with
 
generally
 
accepted
 
accounting 
principles and includes those policies and procedures that: 
●
Pertain to the maintenance of records that
 
in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect
 
the transactions 
and dispositions of our assets; 
●
Provide reasonable assurance that transactions
 
are recorded as necessary to
 
permit preparation of financial 
statements
 
in
 
accordance
 
with
 
generally
 
accepted
 
accounting
 
principles,
 
and
 
that
 
our
 
receipts
 
and 
expenditures are being made
 
only in accordance with
 
authorizations of our management
 
and directors; and 
●
Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or 
disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
2.
 
Our management,
 
in accordance
 
with Rule
 
13a-15(c) under
 
the Exchange
 
Act
 
and with
 
the participation
 
of our 
Chief
 
Executive
 
Officer
 
and
 
Chief
 
Financial
 
Officer,
 
together
 
with
 
other
 
financial
 
officers,
 
evaluated
 
the 
effectiveness
 
of
 
our
 
internal
 
control
 
over
 
financial
 
reporting
 
as
 
of
 
May
 
31,
 
2025. The
 
framework
 
on
 
which 
management’s
 
evaluation
 
of
 
our
 
internal
 
control
 
over
 
financial
 
reporting
 
is
 
based
 
is
 
the
 
“Internal
 
Control
 
– 
Integrated
 
Framework”
published
 
in
 
2013
 
by
 
the
 
Committee
 
of
 
Sponsoring
 
Organizations
 
(“COSO”)
 
of
 
the 
Treadway Commission. 
3.
 
Management has determined that our internal control over financial reporting as of May
 
31, 2025 is effective. It is 
noted
 
that
 
internal
 
control
 
over
 
financial
 
reporting
 
cannot
 
provide
 
absolute
 
assurance
 
of
 
achieving
 
financial 
reporting objectives, but rather reasonable assurance of achieving such objectives.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
Board of Directors and Stockholders 
Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. and Subsidiaries 
Ridgeland, Mississippi 
Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
We have
 
audited Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. and Subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of
 
May 31, 2025, 
based
 
on
 
criteria
 
established
 
in 
2013
 
Internal
 
Control
 
–
 
Integrated
 
Framework
 
issued
 
by
 
the
 
Committee
 
of
 
Sponsoring 
Organizations of the Treadway
 
Commission (“COSO”).
 
In our opinion, Cal-Maine Foods, Inc.
 
and Subsidiaries maintained, in 
all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2025, based on criteria established in 
2013 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework
 
issued by the COSO. 
We
 
also have
 
audited, in
 
accordance with
 
the standards
 
of the
 
Public Company
 
Accounting Oversight
 
Board (United 
States) (“PCAOB”), the consolidated balance sheets and the related
 
consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, 
stockholders’ equity, and cash flows of Cal-Maine Foods, Inc.
 
and Subsidiaries and our report dated July 22, 2025 expressed an 
unqualified opinion. 
Basis for Opinion 
Cal-Maine
 
Foods,
 
Inc.
 
and
 
Subsidiaries’
 
management
 
is
 
responsible
 
for
 
maintaining
 
effective
 
internal
 
control
 
over 
financial
 
reporting,
 
and
 
for
 
their
 
assessment
 
of
 
the
 
effectiveness
 
of
 
internal
 
control
 
over
 
financial
 
reporting,
 
included
 
in
 
the 
accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting in Item 9A.
 
Our responsibility is to express 
an opinion on
 
the entities’ internal
 
control over financial
 
reporting based on
 
our audit.
 
We are a public accounting firm
 
registered 
with the PCAOB and are required to be
 
independent with respect to Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. and
 
Subsidiaries in accordance with 
the U.S.
 
federal securities
 
laws and
 
the applicable
 
rules and
 
regulations of
 
the Securities
 
and Exchange
 
Commission and
 
the 
PCAOB. 
We
 
conducted our
 
audit in
 
accordance with
 
the standards
 
of
 
the PCOAB.
 
Those standards
 
require that
 
we plan
 
and 
perform the audit to
 
obtain reasonable assurance about
 
whether effective internal control
 
over financial reporting was
 
maintained 
in all
 
material respects.
 
Our audit
 
of internal
 
control over
 
financial reporting
 
included obtaining
 
an understanding
 
of internal 
control over
 
financial reporting,
 
assessing the
 
risk that
 
a material
 
weakness exists,
 
and testing
 
and evaluating
 
the design
 
and 
operating effectiveness of internal control based on
 
the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing
 
such other procedures 
as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
An entities’ internal control over
 
financial reporting is a process
 
designed to provide reasonable assurance
 
regarding the 
reliability of financial reporting
 
and the preparation of
 
consolidated financial statements for
 
external purposes in accordance
 
with 
accounting principles generally
 
accepted in the
 
United States of
 
America. An
 
entities’ internal control
 
over financial reporting 
includes those
 
policies and
 
procedures that
 
(1) pertain
 
to the
 
maintenance of
 
records that,
 
in reasonable
 
detail, accurately
 
and 
fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of
 
the assets of the entities; (2) provide
 
reasonable assurance that transactions are 
recorded
 
as
 
necessary
 
to
 
permit
 
preparation
 
of
 
consolidated
 
financial
 
statements
 
in
 
accordance
 
with
 
accounting
 
principles 
generally accepted
 
in the
 
United States
 
of America,
 
and that
 
receipts and
 
expenditures of
 
the entities
 
are being
 
made only
 
in 
accordance
 
with
 
authorizations
 
of
 
management
 
and
 
directors
 
of
 
the
 
entities;
 
and
 
(3)
 
provide
 
reasonable
 
assurance
 
regarding 
prevention or
 
timely detection of
 
unauthorized acquisition, use,
 
or disposition
 
of the
 
entities’ assets
 
that could
 
have a
 
material 
effect on the consolidated financial statements. 
 
Because of
 
its inherent
 
limitations, internal
 
control over
 
financial reporting
 
may not
 
prevent or
 
detect misstatements. 
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate 
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
