Narrative Description of Business
The Origins of 1-800-FLOWERS.COM
The Company’s operations began in 1976 when James F. McCann, the Company’s founder and current Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors, acquired a single retail florist in New York City, which he subsequently expanded to a 14-store chain. Thereafter, the Company modified its business strategy to take advantage of the rapid emergence of toll-free calling. The Company acquired the right to use the toll-free telephone number 1-800-FLOWERS, adopted it as its corporate identity and began to aggressively build a national brand around it.
The Company’s Strategy
The Company’s objective is to be the leading authority on thoughtful gifting, to serve an expanding range of our customers’ celebratory needs, thereby helping our customers express themselves and connect with the important people in their lives. The Company will continue to build on the trusted relationships with our customers by providing them with ease of access, tasteful and appropriate gifts, and superior service. By engaging with our customers, we help to inspire more human expression and connection – sentiments that are more important than ever in the current environment.
The Company believes that 1-800-FLOWERS.COM® is one of the most recognized brands in the floral and gift industries. The strength of its brand has enabled the Company to extend its product offerings beyond the floral category into complementary products, which include gourmet popcorn, cookies and related baked and snack food products, premium chocolate and confections, wine gifts, gourmet gift baskets, fruit arrangements, and gift-quality fruit baskets, dipped berries, steaks, chops, seafood and prepared meals, as well as an extensive selection of personalized products. On January 10, 2023, the Company completed its acquisition of certain assets of the Things Remembered® brand, a complete online gifting and personalization destination renowned for its men’s and women’s jewelry, drinkware, home décor, business gifts and awards, and wedding essentials, which was integrated into the Personalization Mall® brand. On April 3, 2024, the Company completed its acquisition of Card Isle, an e-commerce greeting card company, expanding the Company’s presence in the greeting card category across its brands. On July 1, 2024, the Company acquired Scharffen Berger®, a manufacturer of giftable premium chocolate and specialty treats, expanding the Company's product offerings in the Gourmet Foods & Gift Baskets segment. This extended line of gift offerings helps our customers with their celebratory occasions and will enable the Company to increase the purchase frequency and average order value for existing customers who have come to trust the 1-800-FLOWERS.COM brand, as well as continue to attract new customers. The platform that the Company has built allows it to expand rapidly into new product categories using a “marketplace” concept, providing its customers with a wider selection of solutions to help them express, connect and celebrate for all occasions and recipients – including themselves.

We have a large customer file, including 0.9 million Celebrations Passport members who, along with our multi-brand customers, represent our best customer cohorts in terms of frequency, retention and average spend, and thus customer lifetime value.

A summary of the Company’s significant brands and/or businesses follows:
Although the Company’s family of brands maintain their own sense of identity, the Company has taken a holistic approach towards operating its brand portfolio. A key feature of this approach is that the Company proactively shares best practices across its functional areas, through centralized operational centers of excellence focused on identifying initiatives designed to enhance top and bottom-line growth opportunities.

Technology Infrastructure
The Company believes it has been and continues to be a leader in implementing new technologies to give its customers the best possible shopping experience, whether online or over the telephone. Orders are transmitted directly from the Company’s secure websites, or with the assistance of a gift advisor, into our internally developed transaction processing system, which captures the required customer and recipient information. The system then routes the order to the appropriate distribution center or, for florist fulfilled or drop-shipped items, selects a florist or vendor to fulfill the customer’s order and electronically refers the necessary information using BloomLink, the Company’s proprietary Internet-based system. The Company’s gift advisors have electronic access to this system, enabling them to assist in order fulfillment and subsequently track other customer and/or order information.
Fulfillment and Manufacturing Operations
The Company’s customers primarily place their orders either online or over the telephone. The Company’s hybrid fulfillment system, which enables the Company to offer same-day, next-day and any-day delivery, combines the use of BloomNet (comprised of independent florists operating retail flower shops and franchise florist shops) with Company distribution centers and vendors who ship directly to the Company’s customers. While providing a significant competitive advantage in terms of delivery options, the Company’s fulfillment system also has the added benefit of reducing the Company’s capital investments in inventory and infrastructure. The Company’s products are
 backed by a 100% smile guarantee
, and the Company’s business is not dependent on any single third-party supplier.
Fulfillment and manufacturing of products is as follows:
Flowers, Plants, and Personalized Gifts.
 A majority of the Company’s floral orders are fulfilled by one of the Company’s BloomNet members, allowing the Company to deliver its floral and fruit bouquet products on a same-day or next-day basis to ensure freshness and to meet its customers’ needs for immediate gifting. In addition to these florist-designed products, the Company also offers fresh cut floral arrangements in a wide assortment of combinations, themes and designer bouquets and collections through its direct ship program, including flowers fresh from the farm. Also, the Company offers a broad selection of personalized gifts and keepsakes that are manufactured utilizing same-day/next-day capabilities, and distributed from its Bolingbrook, IL facility.
Gourmet Foods & Gift Baskets.
 The Company offers a wide array of premium brand, signature baked products, chocolate, confections, gift baskets, gourmet popcorn, dipped berries, giftable fruit towers and baskets, and related products through its Gourmet Foods & Gift Baskets brands. The Company’s Cheryl’s cookies and baked gifts are manufactured primarily in its baking facility in Westerville, Ohio, while The Popcorn Factory and Moose Munch premium snack products are popped in Medford, Oregon and Lake Forest, Illinois. Harry & David products are grown and manufactured primarily from its facilities in Medford, Oregon, supplemented by specialty products that are sourced across the U.S. and the world. Scharffen Berger products are primarily manufactured in Ashland, Oregon. Gift basket confection and fulfillment for both wholesale and 1-800-Baskets.com is handled by our DesignPac facility, located in Melrose Park, Illinois. Our products are distributed from a combination of Company-owned and leased distribution facilities across the country, which are shared by our brands in order to reduce both transit time to the customer and overall logistics costs. Dipped berries and other specialty treats for our Shari’s Berries brand are manufactured and fulfilled through our network of drop ship vendors.
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
The Company’s raw materials consist of ingredients for manufactured products (including various commodities such as sugar, flour, cocoa, eggs, fruit and flowers), packaging supplies, and other supplies used in the manufacturing and transportation processes (such as fuel, natural gas and derivative products). Except for certain crops that are grown in our Harry & David orchards, raw materials used by the Company are purchased from third parties, some of whom are single-source suppliers. The prices we pay, and the availability of these materials and other commodities are subject to fluctuation. When prices for these items change, we may or may not pass the change to our customers. We utilize a global supply chain that includes both U.S. and international suppliers. Our suppliers are subject to standards of conduct, including requirements that they comply with local labor laws, local worker safety laws and other applicable laws. Our ability to acquire from our suppliers the assortment and volume we need to meet customer demand, to receive those materials timely through our supply chain and to produce, manufacture and distribute those products determines, in part, our ability to grow the business, and the appeal of our merchandise assortment we offer to our customers.

Seasonality
The Company’s quarterly results may experience seasonal fluctuations. Due to the seasonal nature of the Company’s business, and its continued expansion into non-floral products, the Thanksgiving through Christmas holiday season, which falls within the Company’s second fiscal qu
arter, generates over 40% o
f the Company’s annual revenues, and all of its earnings. Due to the number of major floral gifting occasions, including Mother’s Day, Valentine’s Day, Easter and Administrative Professionals Week, revenues also rise during the Company’s fiscal third and fourth quarters in comparison to its fiscal first quarter. During fiscal 2025, our fiscal second quarter revenues represented approximately 46% of annual revenues, while our first, third and fourth quarters generated 14%, 20%, and 20% of annual revenues, respectively.
In preparation for the Company’s second quarter holiday season, the Company significantly increases its inventories. This seasonal build, which peaks in November, has traditionally been financed by cash flows from operations, supplemented by borrowings under the Company's revolving credit facility. The Company has historically repaid the balance of its revolving credit facility with cash generated from operations prior to the end of the Company’s fiscal second quarter.
Competition
The popularity and convenience of e-commerce shopping has continued to give rise to established businesses on the Internet. In addition to selling their products over the Internet, many of these retailers sell their products through a combination of channels by maintaining a website, a toll-free phone number and physical locations. Additionally, several of these merchants offer an expanding variety of products and some are attracting an increasing number of customers. Certain mass merchants have expanded their offerings to include competing products and may continue to do so in the future. These businesses, as well as other potential competitors, may be able to:
•
undertake more extensive marketing campaigns for their brands and services;
•
adopt more aggressive pricing policies; and
•
make more attractive offers to potential employees, distributors and retailers.
In addition, the Company faces intense competition in each of its individual product categories. In the floral industry, there are various providers of floral products, none of which is dominant in the industry. The Company’s competitors include:
•
retail floral shops, some of which maintain toll-free telephone numbers, websites, and mobile applications;
•
online marketplaces, floral retailers and social media platform retailers, as well as retailers offering substitute gift products;
•
catalog companies that offer floral products;
•
floral telemarketers and wire services; and
•
supermarkets, mass merchants and specialty retailers with floral departments.
Similarly, the plant, gift basket and gourmet foods categories are highly competitive. Each of these categories encompasses a wide range of products, is highly fragmented and is served by a large number of companies, none of which is dominant. Products in these categories may be purchased from a number of outlets, including mass merchants, telemarketers, retail specialty shops, online retailers and mail-order catalogs.
The Company believes the strength of its brands, product selection, customer relationships, technology infrastructure and fulfillment capabilities position it to compete effectively against its current and potential competitors in each of its product categories. However, increased competition could result in:
•
price reductions, decreased revenues and lower profit margins;
•
loss of market share; and
•
increased marketing expenditures.
These and other competitive factors may adversely impact the Company’s business and results of operations.

Government Regulation and Legal Uncertainties
We are subject to a growing number of local, state, and national laws and regulations, including laws applicable to e-commerce, all of which continue to evolve. Compliance is costly and can require changes to our business practices and significant amounts of management time and focus. In addition, laws may be inconsistent across various locations in which we do business, posing significant challenges to our national operations. 
Legislatures are also considering an increasing number of laws and regulations pertaining to the Internet, including laws and regulations addressing:
•
user privacy;
•
pricing;
•
content;
•
connectivity;
•
intellectual property;
•
distribution;
•
taxation and tariffs;
•
liabilities;
•
antitrust; and
•
characteristics and quality of products and services.
Further, the growth and development of the market for online services may prompt more stringent consumer protection laws that may impose additional burdens on those companies conducting business online. This could decrease the demand for the Company’s services and increase its cost of doing business. Moreover, the applicability to the Internet of existing laws regarding issues like property ownership, taxes, libel and personal privacy is uncertain. Any new legislation or regulation that has an adverse impact on the Internet or the application of existing laws and regulations to the Internet could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

Legal, Regulatory, Tax and Other Risks.
Intellectual Property 
The Company regards its service marks, trademarks, trade secrets, domain names and similar intellectual property as critical to its success. The Company has applied for or received trademark and/or service mark registration for, among others, “1-800-FLOWERS.COM”, “1-800-FLOWERS”, “1-800-Baskets.com”, “FruitBouquets.com”, “BloomNet”, "Card Isle", “GreatFood.com”, “The Popcorn Factory”, “Cheryl’s Cookies”, “Mrs. Beasley’s”, “Celebrations Passport”, “Flowerama”, “DesignPac”, “Harry & David”, “Wolferman’s Bakery”, “Moose Munch”, “Cushman’s”, “Simply Chocolate”, “Personalization Universe”, “Personalization Mall”, “Things Remembered”, “Shari’s Berries”, "Scharffen Berger", “SmartGift”, “Vital Choice” and “Alice’s Table”. The Company also has rights to numerous domain names, including: www.1800flowers.com, www.cardisle.com, www.800flowers.com, www.1800baskets.com, www.flowers.com, www.personalizationuniverse.com, www.personalizationmall.com, www.thingsremembered.com, www.plants.com, www.florists.com, www.greatfoods.com, www.cheryls.com, www.celebrations.com, www.flowerama.com, www.designpac.com, www.simplychocolate.com, www.mybloomnet.net, www.napcoimports.com, www.thepopcornfactory.com, www.harryanddavid.com, www.wolfermans.com, www.vitalchoice.com, www.alicestable.com, www.berries.com, www.sharisberries.com, www.scharffenberger.com, and www.smartgift.com. In addition, the Company owns a number of international trademarks and/or service marks. The Company has also developed transaction processing and operating systems as well as marketing data, and customer and recipient information databases.
The Company relies on trademark, unfair competition and copyright law, trade secret protection and contracts such as confidentiality and license agreements with its employees, customers, vendors and others to protect its proprietary rights. Despite the Company’s precautions, it may be possible for competitors to obtain and/or use the Company’s proprietary information without authorization or to develop technologies similar to the Company’s and independently create a similarly functioning infrastructure. Furthermore, the protection of proprietary rights in Internet-related industries is uncertain and still evolving. The laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. The Company’s means of protecting its proprietary rights in the United States or abroad may not be adequate.

Table of Contents
Third parties have in the past infringed or misappropriated the Company’s intellectual property or similar proprietary rights. The Company believes infringements and misappropriations will continue to occur in the future. The Company intends to guard against infringement and misappropriation. However, the Company cannot guarantee it will be able to enforce its rights and enjoin the alleged infringers from their use of confusingly similar trademarks, service marks, telephone numbers and domain names.
In addition, third parties may assert infringement claims against the Company. The Company cannot be certain that its technologies or its products and services do not infringe valid patents, trademarks, copyrights or other proprietary rights held by third parties. The Company may be subject to legal proceedings and claims from time to time relating to its intellectual property and the intellectual property of others in the ordinary course of its business. Intellectual property litigation is expensive and time-consuming and could divert management resources away from running the Company’s business.
Human Capital
Employees
. We focus on attracting, developing and retaining skilled talent, including recruiting from among the universities across the markets in which we compete and are generally able to select top talent. We focus on developing our employees by providing a variety of job experiences, training programs and skill development opportunities. As of June 29, 2025, the Company had approximately 3,900 ful
l and part-time employees,
 all located in the United States. During peak periods, the Company substantially increases the number of customer service, manufacturing, and fulfillment personnel. The Company’s employees are not represented under collective bargaining agreements and the Company considers its relations with its employees to be good. Our employees are a key source of our competitive advantage and their actions, guided by our Code of Ethics, are critical to the long-term success of our business.
Workforce Inclusion and Belonging
. As a company, we are committed to building an inclusive and equitable culture that welcomes everyone and embraces and celebrates all of our associates’ backgrounds and life experiences.
Compensation and Benefits.
 The Company aims to attract and retain a talented workforce by offering competitive compensation and benefits, strong career development and a respectful and inclusive culture that provides equal opportunity for all. We believe our base wages and salaries, which we review annually, are fair and competitive with the external labor markets in which our associates work. We encourage and reward employees based upon the achievement of financial and other key performance metrics, which strengthens the connection between pay and performance. We also grant equity compensation awards that vest over time through our long-term incentive plan to eligible associates to align such associates’ incentives with the Company’s long-term strategic objectives and the interests of our stockholders. We also offer competitive benefit programs, in line with local practices, with flexibility to accommodate the needs of a diverse workforce, including paid vacation and holidays, family leave, disability insurance, life insurance, healthcare, and a 401(k) plan with a company match.
Health, Safety and Wellness.
 From a workplace safety standpoint, we focus on training, awareness, behavioral-based work observation practices, and culture in our continuous effort to reduce workplace injuries and accidents. We are continually focused on the safety of our associates and have a strong emphasis on identifying and addressing the safety risks to and concerns of our associates.

ltem 1A.    Risk Factors
Cautionary Statements Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995
Our disclosures and analysis in this Form 10-K contain some forward-looking statements that set forth anticipated results based on management’s plans and assumptions. From time to time, we also provide forward-looking statements in other statements we release to the public as well as oral forward-looking statements. Such statements give our current expectations or forecasts concerning future events; they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Such statements can generally be identified by words such as “anticipate,” “estimate,” “expect,” “project,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe”, “foresee,” “forecast,” “likely,” “should,” “will,” “target,” or similar words or phrases. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors, many of which are outside of our control, which could cause actual results to differ materially from the results expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to,  statements relating to future actions; our ability to leverage our operating platform and reduce our operating expense ratio; our ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses and assets; our ability to successfully execute our strategic priorities; our ability to cost effectively acquire and retain customers and drive purchase frequency; the outcome of contingencies, including legal proceedings in the normal course of business; our ability to compete against existing and new competitors; our ability to manage expenses associated with sales and marketing and necessary general and administrative and technology investments; our ability to reduce promotional activities and achieve more efficient marketing programs; and general consumer sentiment and industry and economic conditions that may affect levels of discretionary customer purchases of our products.
We cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be realized, although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions. Achievement of future results is subject to risk, uncertainties and potentially inaccurate assumptions. Should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could differ materially from past results and those anticipated, estimated or projected. You should bear this in mind as you consider forward-looking statements.
We undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our 10-Q and 8-K reports to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Also note we provide the following cautionary discussion of risks, uncertainties and possibly inaccurate assumptions relevant to our business. These are factors that, individually or in the aggregate, we think could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results. We note these factors for investors as permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
Macroeconomic Conditions and Related Risk Factors
The financial and credit markets and consumer sentiment have and will experience significant volatility, which may have an adverse effect on our customers’ spending patterns and in turn our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 The Company’s business and operating results are subject to economic conditions and their impact on consumer discretionary spending. Factors that may negatively impact consumer spending include high levels of unemployment, higher consumer debt levels, reductions in net worth, reductions in disposable income levels, declines in asset values, and related market uncertainty; home foreclosures and reductions in home values; fluctuating interest rates and credit availability; fluctuating fuel and other energy costs; fluctuating commodity prices; and general uncertainty regarding the overall future political and economic environment. Consumer spending patterns are difficult to predict and are sensitive to the general economic climate, the consumer’s level of disposable income, consumer debt, and overall consumer confidence. In the recent past, such factors have impacted and may continue to impact our business in a number of ways. Included among these current and potential future negative impacts are reduced demand and lower prices for our products and services. Adverse economic changes could reduce consumer confidence and could thereby affect our operating results. In challenging and uncertain economic environments, including the current geopolitical climate, we cannot predict when macroeconomic conditions uncertainty may arise and whether such circumstances could impact the Company.

We are dependent on international vendors for our supply of flowers, as well as certain components and products, exposing us to significant regulatory, global economic, taxation, political instability and other risks, which could adversely impact our financial results.
The availability and price of flowers, as well as certain components and products that we rely on to manufacture and sell our products could be adversely affected by a number of factors affecting international locations, including:
•
import duties and quotas, such as the tariffs that were imposed on flowers imported from Colombia during fiscal 2025;
•
agricultural limitations and restrictions to manage pests and disease;
•
changes in trading status;
•
economic uncertainties and currency fluctuations;
•
severe weather;
•
work stoppages;
•
foreign government regulations and political unrest; and
•
trade restrictions, including United States retaliation against foreign trade practices.
The U.S. has recently instituted or proposed changes in trade policies that include the negotiation or termination of trade agreements, the imposition of higher tariffs on imports into the U.S., economic sanctions on individuals, corporations or countries, and other government regulations affecting trade between the U.S. and other countries where we conduct business. As a result, there have been, and may continue to be, greater restrictions and economic disincentives on international trade, and considerable uncertainty about future U.S trade policies. These developments have the potential to adversely impact the U.S. economy, our industry and the demand for our products. While we are managing the impact of recent trade policy changes by evaluating sourcing opportunities outside of China, working with existing vendors on concessions, changing componentry, modifying our assortment, and adjusting our pricing, it has been and may continue to be time-consuming and expensive for us to alter our business operations in order to adapt to or comply with shifting trade policies. As a result, such changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Increased shipping costs and supply chain disruptions may adversely affect sales of the Company’s products
. Many of the Company's products are delivered to customers either directly from the manufacturer or from the Company’s fulfillment centers. The Company has established relationships with Federal Express and other common carriers for the delivery of these products. If these carriers increase the prices they charge to ship the Company’s goods, and if the Company is forced to pass these costs on to its customers, or if carrier capacity becomes constrained, due to strikes or otherwise, the Company’s sales could be negatively impacted. In addition, ocean container availability and cost, as well as port and shipping route disruptions could impact the Company’s ability to deliver products on a timely basis to our customers and adversely affect its customer relationships, revenues and earnings.
If the supply of flowers for sale becomes limited, the price of flowers could rise or flowers may be unavailable and the Company’s revenues and gross margins could decline.
 A variety of factors affect the supply of flowers in the United States and the price of the Company’s floral products. If the supply of flowers available for sale is limited due to weather conditions, farm closures, economic conditions, political conditions in supplier locations, or other factors, prices for flowers could rise and as a result customer demand for the Company’s floral products may be reduced, causing revenues and gross margins to decline. Alternatively, the Company may not be able to obtain high quality flowers in an amount sufficient to meet customer demand. Even if available, flowers from alternative sources may be of lesser quality and/or may be more expensive than those currently offered by the Company.
Most of the flowers sold in the United States are grown by farmers located abroad, primarily in Colombia, Ecuador and Holland, and the Company expects that this will continue in the future.
The Company's operating results may suffer due to economic, political and social unrest or disturbances
. Like other American businesses, the Company is unable to predict what long-term effect acts of terrorism, war, or similar unforeseen events may have on its business. The Company’s results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted if such events cause an economic slowdown in the United States, negatively impact the supply chain, increase the cost of key components for our gifts, or have other negative effects that cannot now be anticipated.

Business and Operational Risk Factors
The Company’s operating results may fluctuate, and this fluctuation could cause financial results to be below expectations.
 The Company’s operating results may fluctuate from period to period for a number of reasons. In budgeting the Company’s operating expenses for the foreseeable future, the Company makes assumptions regarding revenue trends; however, some of the Company’s operating expenses are fixed in the short term. Sales of the Company’s products are seasonal, concentrated in the fourth calendar quarter, due to the Thanksgiving and Christmas-time holidays, and the second calendar quarter, due to Mother’s Day and Administrative Professionals’ Week. In anticipation of increased sales activity during these periods, the Company hires a significant number of temporary employees to supplement its permanent staff and the Company increases its inventory levels. If revenues during these periods do not meet the Company’s expectations, it may not generate sufficient revenue to offset these increased costs and its operating results may suffer.
The Company’s quarterly operating results may significantly fluctuate and you should not rely on them as an indication of its future results
. The Company’s future revenues and results of operations may significantly fluctuate due to a combination of factors, many of which are outside of management’s control. The most important of these factors include:
•
seasonality;
•
the retail economy;
•
the timing and effectiveness of marketing programs;
•
the timing of the introduction of new products and services;
•
the Company’s ability to find and maintain reliable sources for certain of its products;
•
the impact of severe weather, natural disasters, or public health conditions such as pandemics, on consumer demand;
•
the timing and effectiveness of capital expenditures;
•
the Company’s ability to enter into or renew online marketing agreements; and
•
competition.
The Company may be unable to reduce operating expenses quickly enough to offset any unexpected revenue shortfall. If the Company has a shortfall in revenue without a corresponding reduction to its expenses, operating results may suffer. The Company’s operating results for any particular quarter may not be indicative of future operating results. You should not rely on quarter-to-quarter comparisons of results of operations as an indication of the Company’s future performance. It is possible that results of operations may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors, which could cause the trading price of the Company’s Class A common stock to fall.
During peak periods, the Company utilizes temporary employees and outsourced staff, who may not be as well-trained or committed to its customers as its permanent employees, and if they fail to provide the Company’s customers with high quality customer service the customers may not return, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
 The Company depends on its customer service department to respond to its customers should they have questions or problems with their orders. During peak periods, the Company relies on its permanent employees, as well as temporary employees and outsourced staff to respond to customer inquiries. These temporary employees and outsourced staff may not have the same level of commitment to the Company’s customers or be as well trained as its permanent employees. If the Company’s customers are dissatisfied with the quality of the customer service they receive, they may not shop with the Company again, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
If the Company fails to develop and maintain its brands, it may not increase or maintain its customer base or its revenues. 
The Company must continue to develop and maintain the its brands to expand its customer base and its revenues. In addition, the Company has introduced and acquired other brands in the past, and may continue to do so in the future. The Company believes that the importance of brand recognition will increase as it expands its product offerings. Many of the Company’s customers may not be aware of the Company’s non-floral products. If the Company fails to advertise and market its products effectively, it may not succeed in establishing its brands and may lose customers leading to a reduction of revenues.
The Company’s success in promoting and enhancing the 1-800-FLOWERS.COM brands will also depend on its success in providing its customers high-quality products and a high level of customer service. If the Company’s customers do not perceive its products and services to be of high quality, the value of the 1-800-FLOWERS.COM brands would be diminished and the Company may lose customers and its revenues may decline.

Marketing programs that generate a significant amount of traffic may be less effective or less cost-efficient than in previous periods, which could limit the volume and growth of the Company’s business. 
Although the Company expects a significant portion of its customers will continue to come directly to its website, mobile applications, and telephone call center, it will also rely on marketing arrangements with third party websites, search engines, display advertising providers, social media platforms, and affiliates with which the Company has strategic relationships for traffic. If these third parties do not attract a significant number of visitors, the Company may not receive a significant number of customers from these relationships and its revenues from these relationships may decrease or remain flat. There continues to be strong competition to establish or maintain relationships with leading Internet companies, and the Company may not successfully enter into additional relationships or renew existing ones beyond their current terms. The Company may also be required to pay significant fees to maintain and expand existing relationships. The Company’s online revenues may suffer if it does not enter into new strategic online and social media relationships or maintain such existing relationships or if these relationships do not result in traffic sufficient to justify their costs. In addition, current or future legislation or changes to third parties’ policies may limit the Company’s ability to effectively reach consumers whose behavior suggests that they might be interested in Company products. Vendors of advertising and analytics products and services have modified and may continue to modify their products and services in ways that could reduce the efficiency of our marketing efforts, such as changes to cookie settings and policies, modifications of organic search and paid listing algorithms, the addition of AI summaries to online search engine results, and the introduction of new AI assistant platforms. While we strive to adjust our marketing strategies in response to these changes, there can be no guarantee that any adjustments will be effective. Any reduction in our ability to make effective use of advertising technologies could harm our ability to personalize the experience of prospective customers, increase our costs, and limit our ability to attract and retain customers on cost-effective terms. As a result, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. 
If local florists and other third-party vendors do not fulfill orders to the Company’s customers’ satisfaction, customers may not shop with the Company again.
 In many cases, floral orders placed by the Company’s customers are fulfilled by local independent florists, a majority of which are members of BloomNet. The Company does not directly control any of these florists. In addition, many of the non-floral products sold by the Company are manufactured and delivered to its customers by independent third-party vendors. If customers are dissatisfied with the performance of the local florist or other third-party vendors, they may not utilize the Company’s services when placing future orders and its revenues may decrease.
If a florist discontinues its relationship with the Company, the Company’s customers may experience delays in service or declines in quality and may not shop with the Company again.
 Many of the Company’s arrangements with local florists for order fulfillment may be terminated by either party with 10 days’ notice. If a florist discontinues its relationship with the Company, the Company will be required to obtain a suitable replacement located in the same geographic area, which may cause delays in delivery or a decline in quality, leading to customer dissatisfaction and loss of customers.
If a significant number of customers are not satisfied with their purchase, the Company will be required to incur substantial costs to issue refunds, credits or replacement products.
 The Company offers its customers a 100% satisfaction guarantee on its products. If customers are not satisfied with the products they receive, the Company will either replace the product for the customer or issue the customer a refund or credit. The Company’s net income would decrease if a significant number of customers request replacement products, refunds or credits and the Company is unable to pass such costs onto the supplier. 
Competition in the floral, plant, gift basket, gourmet food, and specialty gift industries is intense and a failure to respond to competitive pressure could result in lost revenues.
 There are many companies that offer products in these categories.
In the floral category, the Company’s competitors include:
•
retail floral shops, some of which maintain toll-free telephone numbers, websites, and mobile applications;
•
online marketplaces, floral retailers, and social media platform retailers, as well as retailers offering substitute gift products;
•
catalog companies that offer floral products;
•
floral telemarketers and wire services; and
•
supermarkets, mass merchants and specialty gift retailers with floral departments.
Similarly, the plant, gift basket, gourmet food, cookie, candy, fruit and specialty gift categories are each highly competitive. Each of these categories encompasses a wide range of products and is highly fragmented. Products in these categories may be purchased from a number of outlets, including mass merchants, retail shops, online retailers and mail-order catalogs.

Competition is intense and the Company expects it to increase. Increased competition could result in:
•
price reductions, decreased revenue and lower profit margins;
•
loss of market share; and
•
increased marketing expenditures.
These and other competitive factors could materially and adversely affect the Company’s results of operations. 
If the Company does not accurately predict customer demand for its products, it may lose customers or experience increased costs.
 If the Company overestimates customer demand for its products, excess inventory and outdated merchandise could accumulate, tying up working capital and potentially resulting in reduced warehouse capacity and inventory losses due to damage, theft and obsolescence. If the Company underestimates customer demand, it may disappoint customers who may turn to its competitors. Moreover, the strength of our brands could be diminished due to misjudgments in merchandise selection.
Extreme weather conditions, natural disasters, public health conditions such as pandemics, and other catastrophic events, may interrupt our business, or our suppliers’ businesses.
 Some of our facilities and our suppliers’ facilities are located in areas that may be subject to extreme, and occasionally prolonged, weather conditions, including hurricanes, tornadoes, and wildfires. Extreme weather conditions, whether caused by global climate change or otherwise, may interrupt our operations in such areas. In addition, public health conditions or other such unforeseen events could affect our and our suppliers' operations. Any such events would negatively impact various functions, such as production, distribution, and order fulfillment. Furthermore, extreme weather conditions may interrupt our suppliers’ production or shipments, or increase our suppliers’ product costs, all of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
Various diseases, pests and certain weather conditions can affect fruit production.
 Various diseases, pests, fungi, viruses, drought, frosts, hail, wildfires, floods and certain other weather conditions could affect the quality and quantity of our fruit production in our Harry & David orchards, decreasing the supply of our products and negatively impacting profitability. Our producing orchards also require adequate water supplies. A substantial reduction in water supplies could result in material losses of crops, which could lead to a shortage of our product supply.
The ripening of our fruits is subject to seasonal fluctuations that could negatively impact profitability.
 The ripening of our fruits in the Harry & David orchards can happen earlier than predicted due to warmer temperatures during the year. This would result in an oversupply of fruits that we might not be able to sell on a timely basis and could result in significant inventory write-offs. The ripening of the Company’s fruits can also happen later than predicted due to colder temperatures during the year. This can cause a delay in product shipments and not being able to timely meet customer demand during the critical holiday season. Both of these scenarios could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
If the Company is unable to hire and retain qualified employees, including key personnel, its business may suffer.
 The Company’s success is dependent on its ability to hire, retain and motivate highly qualified personnel. Given the competitive labor market, we cannot be assured that we can continue to hire, train and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees at current wage rates. In particular, the Company’s success depends on the continued efforts of its senior management team. The loss of the services of any of the Company’s executive management or key personnel or its inability to attract qualified additional personnel could cause its business to suffer and force it to expend time and resources in locating and training additional personnel.
A failure to integrate our acquisitions may cause the results of the acquired company, as well as the results of the Company to suffer.
 The Company has opportunistically acquired a number of companies over the past several years. Additionally, the Company may look to acquire additional companies in the future. As part of the acquisition process, the Company embarks upon a project management effort to integrate the acquisition onto our information technology systems and management processes. Due diligence undertaken with any acquisition may not reveal all potential problems or inefficiencies involved in integrating the acquired entity into the Company. If we are unsuccessful in integrating our acquisitions, the results of our acquisitions may suffer, management may have to divert valuable resources to oversee and manage the acquisitions, the Company may have to expend additional investments in the acquired company to upgrade personnel and/or information technology systems and the results of the Company may suffer.

A failure to dispose of assets or businesses in a timely manner may cause the results of the Company to suffer.
 The Company continues to evaluate the potential disposition of assets and businesses that may no longer help meet its objectives. When the Company decides to sell assets or a business, it may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner, which could delay the accomplishment of its strategic objectives. Alternatively, the Company may dispose of a business at a price or on terms that are less than it had anticipated. After reaching an agreement with a buyer or seller for the disposition of a business, the Company is subject to satisfaction of pre-closing conditions, which may prevent the Company from completing the transaction. Dispositions may also involve continued financial involvement in the divested business, such as through continuing equity ownership, guarantees, indemnities or other financial obligations. Under these arrangements, performance by the divested businesses or other conditions outside the Company’s control could affect its future financial results.
The terms of our existing credit facilities could limit our operating flexibility
. The credit agreement governing our existing credit facilities contains certain financial and certain affirmative and negative covenants requiring us to maintain certain financial ratios and liquidity levels, limiting the ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, make certain investments, make certain restricted payments, incur certain liens or permit them to exist, hold cash deposits in accounts not maintained with lenders under the existing credit facilities or their affiliates, enter into certain types of transactions with affiliates, merge or consolidate with another company, and transfer, sell or otherwise dispose of assets. These terms may affect our ability to obtain future financing and to pursue attractive business opportunities, and our flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in business conditions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we fail to comply with the provisions of our existing credit facilities and if such failure is not cured or waived, it could result in an event of default that could enable our lenders to declare the outstanding principal of that debt, together with accrued and unpaid interest, to be immediately due and payable. Any such default would also limit our ability to obtain additional financing, which could have an adverse effect on our cash flow and liquidity.
We have incurred impairment charges for our goodwill and other long-lived tangible and intangible assets, and may incur further impairment charges in the future, which would negatively impact our operating results. 
We review goodwill and other long-term assets regularly to assess whether indicators of impairment have arisen, the result of which may require that the Company recognize an impairment charge. Impairments have resulted and may result from, among other things, actual or projected decline in performance, adverse changes in interest rates and other market conditions, adverse changes in applicable laws or regulations, and a variety of other factors. We have in the past recorded, and may in the future be required to record, significant charges in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or intangible assets is determined. For example, during fiscal 2025, fiscal 2024, and fiscal 2023, we recorded aggregate non-cash impairment charges of $143.8 million, $19.8 million, and $64.6 million, respectively, related to goodwill and certain trademarks to reduce their carrying value to their estimated fair value. If we are required to record additional non-cash impairment charges to our goodwill, other intangibles, and/or long-lived assets, any such non-cash charge could have a material adverse effect on our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Balance Sheets in the reporting period in which we record the charge.
Information Technology and Systems 
Failure to protect our website, networks and computer systems against disruption and cyber security threats, or otherwise protect our and our customers’ confidential information, could damage our relationships with our customers, harm our reputation, expose us to litigation and adversely affect our business.
 We rely extensively on our computer systems for the successful operation of our business, including corporate email communications to and from employees, customers and retail operations, the design, manufacture and distribution of our finished goods, digital marketing efforts, collection and retention of customer data, employee information, the processing of credit card transactions, online e-commerce activities and our interaction with the public in the social media space. Our systems are subject to damage or interruption from computer viruses, malicious attacks and other security breaches. The possibility of a cyber-attack on any one or all of these systems is always a serious threat and consumer awareness and sensitivity to privacy breaches and cyber security threats is high. If a cybersecurity incident occurs, or there is a public perception that we have suffered a breach, our reputation and brand could be damaged and we could be required to expend significant capital and other resources to alleviate problems.
As part of our business model, we collect, retain, and transmit confidential information over public networks. In addition to our own databases, we use third party service providers to store, process and transmit this information on our behalf. Although we contractually require these service providers to implement and use reasonable security measures, we cannot control third parties and cannot guarantee that a security breach will not occur in the future either at their location or within their systems. We have reasonable and up-to-date security measures in place to protect both our physical facilities and digital systems from attacks. Despite these efforts, we may be vulnerable to targeted or random security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors, or other similar events.

Table of Contents
Given the robust nature of our e-commerce presence and digital strategy, it is imperative that we and our e-commerce partners maintain uninterrupted operation of our: (i) computer hardware, (ii) software systems, (iii) customer marketing databases, and (iv) ability to contact our current and potential customers in various channels.
In addition, our systems may increasingly incorporate features involving artificial intelligence ("AI"), which is complex, subject to increasing litigation and regulatory scrutiny, and may have errors or inadequacies that are not easily detectable. In some instances, we may make use of third-party artificial intelligence products and services. These features, products, and services may produce unintentional or unexpected outputs that are incorrect, infringe intellectual property or other rights, do not match our business goals, do not comply with our internal policies or applicable legal or contractual requirements, or otherwise are inconsistent with our business goals or brand identities. As a result, our implementation of AI features, products and services could subject us to regulatory action, legal liability, and brand or reputational harm.
If our systems are damaged or fail to function properly or reliably, we may incur substantial interruption, repair or replacement costs, experience data loss or theft and impediments to our ability to conduct our operations. Any material disruptions in our e-commerce presence or information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
An increase in the number of employees working remotely has amplified certain risks to the Company’s business and increased demand on the Company’s information technology resources and systems
. A number of the Company's  employees work remotely, which results in increased risks of phishing and other cybersecurity attacks as cybercriminals try to exploit the vulnerabilities surrounding remote work, and an increase in the number of points of potential attack, such as laptops and mobile devices (both of which are now being used in increased numbers), to be secured. Any failure to effectively manage these risks, including to timely identify and appropriately respond to any cyberattacks, may adversely affect the Company’s business.
If the Company fails to continuously improve its website (on all relevant platforms, including mobile), including successful deployment of new technology, it may not attract or retain customers and may otherwise experience harm to its business.
 If potential or existing customers do not find the Company’s website (on all relevant platforms, including mobile) a convenient place to shop, the Company may not attract or retain customers and its sales may suffer. To encourage the use of the Company’s website, it must continuously improve its accessibility, content and ease of use. If the Company is unable to maintain a compelling web presence, including by successfully responding to new technology trends (such as generative artificial intelligence), competitors' websites may be perceived as easier to use or better able to satisfy customer needs. In addition, our use of generative AI in certain features of our website may present risks and challenges that remain uncertain due to the relative novelty of this technology, and could subject us to competitive harm, regulatory action, legal liability and brand or reputational harm.
The Company’s business could be injured by significant credit card, debit card and gift card fraud.
 Customers typically pay for their online or telephone orders with debit or credit cards as well as a portion of their orders using gift cards. The Company’s revenues and gross margins could decrease if it experienced significant credit card, debit card and gift card fraud. Failure to adequately detect and avoid fraudulent credit card, debit card and gift card transactions could cause the Company to lose its ability to accept credit cards or debit cards as forms of payment and/or result in charge-backs of the fraudulently charged amounts and/or significantly decrease revenues. Furthermore, widespread credit card, debit card and gift card fraud may lessen the Company’s customers’ willingness to purchase products through the Company’s websites or toll-free telephone numbers. For this reason, such failure could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Unexpected system interruptions caused by system failures may result in reduced revenues and harm to the Company’s brand.
 In the past, particularly during peak holiday periods, the Company has experienced significant increases in traffic on its website and in its toll-free customer service centers. The Company’s operations are dependent on its ability to maintain its computer and telecommunications systems in effective working order and to protect its systems against damage from fire, natural disaster, power loss, telecommunications failure, security breaches (including breaches of our transaction processing or other systems that could result in the compromise of confidential customer data), or similar events. The Company’s systems have in the past, and may in the future, experience:
•
system interruptions;
•
long response times; and
•
degradation in service.
16
Table of Contents
In addition, the Company periodically updates or replaces legacy systems with successor systems. Implementation of new systems in prior periods has resulted in business disruptions and associated costs, as previously disclosed. If the Company fails to timely and successfully effect any future system updates, the Company’s order management, fulfillment, or other business processes could experience interruptions, and our results of operations could be negatively affected.
The Company’s business depends on customers making purchases on its systems. Its revenues may decrease and its reputation could be harmed if it experiences frequent or long system delays or interruptions or if a disruption occurs during a peak holiday season.
If the Company’s telecommunications providers do not adequately maintain the Company’s service, the Company may experience system failures and its revenues may decrease
. The Company is dependent on telecommunication providers to provide telephone services and connectivity to its customer service centers and data centers. Although the Company maintains redundant telecommunications systems, if these providers experience system failures or fail to adequately maintain the Company’s systems, the Company may experience interruptions and will be unable to generate revenue. The Company depends upon these third-party relationships because it does not have the resources to maintain its service without these or other third parties. Failure to maintain these relationships or replace them on financially attractive terms may disrupt the Company’s operations or require it to incur significant unanticipated costs.
Legal, Regulatory, Tax and Other Risks
Unauthorized use of the Company’s intellectual property by third parties may damage its brands.
 Unauthorized use of the Company’s intellectual property by third parties may damage its brands and its reputation and may likely result in a loss of customers. It may be possible for third parties to obtain and use the Company’s intellectual property without authorization. Third parties have in the past infringed or misappropriated the Company’s intellectual property or similar proprietary rights. The Company believes infringements and misappropriations will continue to occur in the future. Furthermore, the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property in Internet-related industries is uncertain and still evolving. The Company has been unable to register certain of its intellectual property in some foreign countries and furthermore, the laws of some foreign countries are uncertain or do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. The protection of the Company's intellectual property may require significant time and expense, and we may not be successful in our efforts. 
The Company’s franchisees may damage its brands or increase its costs by failing to comply with its franchise agreements or its operating standards.
 The Company’s franchise business is governed by its Uniform Franchise Disclosure Document, franchise agreements and applicable franchise law. If the Company’s franchisees do not comply with its established operating standards or the terms of the franchise agreements, the 1-800-FLOWERS.COM brands may be damaged. The Company may incur significant additional costs, including time-consuming and expensive litigation, to enforce its rights under the franchise agreements. Additionally, the Company is the primary tenant on certain leases, which the franchisees sublease from the Company. If a franchisee fails to meet its obligations as subtenant, the Company could incur significant costs to avoid default under the primary lease. Furthermore, as a franchisor, the Company has obligations to its franchisees. Franchisees may challenge the performance of the Company’s obligations under the franchise agreements and subject it to costs in defending these claims and, if the claims are successful, costs in connection with their compliance.
If third parties acquire rights to use similar domain names or phone numbers or if the Company loses the right to use its phone numbers, its brands may be damaged and it may lose sales.
 The Company’s Internet domain names are an important aspect of its brand recognition. The Company cannot practically acquire rights to all domain names similar to www.1800flowers.com, or its other brands, whether under existing top level domains or those issued in the future. If third parties obtain rights to similar domain names, these third parties may confuse the Company’s customers and cause its customers to inadvertently place orders with these third parties, which could result in lost sales and could damage its brands.
Likewise, the phone number that spells 1-800-FLOWERS is important to the Company’s brand and its business. While the Company has obtained the right to use the phone numbers 1-800-FLOWERS, 1-888-FLOWERS and 1-877-FLOWERS, as well as common toll-free “FLOWERS” misdials, it may not be able to obtain rights to use the FLOWERS phone number as new toll-free prefixes are issued, or the rights to all similar and potentially confusing numbers. If third parties obtain the phone number that spells “FLOWERS" with a different prefix or a toll-free number similar to FLOWERS, these parties may also confuse the Company’s customers and cause lost sales and potential damage to its brands. In addition, under applicable FCC rules, ownership rights to phone numbers cannot be acquired. Accordingly, the FCC may rescind the Company’s right to use any of its phone numbers, including 1-800-FLOWERS (1-800-356-9377).

Defending against intellectual property infringement claims could be expensive and, if the Company is not successful, could disrupt its ability to conduct business.
 The Company has been unable to register certain of its intellectual properties in some foreign countries, including, “1-800-Flowers.com”, “1-800-Flowers” and “800-Flowers”. The Company cannot be certain that the products it sells, or services it offers, do not or will not infringe valid patents, trademarks, copyrights or other intellectual property rights held by third parties. The Company may be a party to legal proceedings and claims relating to the intellectual property of others from time to time in the ordinary course of its business. The Company may incur substantial expense in defending against these third-party infringement claims, regardless of their merit. Successful infringement claims against the Company may result in substantial monetary liability or may materially disrupt its ability to conduct business.
Product liability claims may subject the Company to increased costs.
 Several of the products the Company sells, including perishable food and alcoholic beverage products, may expose it to product liability claims in the event that the use or consumption of these products results in personal injury or property damage. Although the Company has not experienced any material losses due to product liability claims to date, it may be a party to product liability claims in the future and incur significant costs in their defense. Product liability claims often create negative publicity, which could materially damage the Company’s reputation and its brands. Although the Company maintains insurance against product liability claims, its coverage may be inadequate to cover any liabilities it may incur.
Future litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
 Lawsuits and other administrative or legal proceedings that may arise in the course of our operations can involve substantial costs, including the costs associated with investigation, litigation and possible settlement, judgment, penalty or fine. In addition, lawsuits and other legal proceedings may be time consuming and may require a commitment of management and personnel resources that will be diverted from our normal business operations. Although we generally maintain insurance to mitigate certain costs, there can be no assurance that costs associated with lawsuits or other legal proceedings will not exceed the limits of insurance policies. Moreover, we may be unable to continue to maintain our existing insurance at a reasonable cost, if at all, or to secure additional coverage, which may result in costs associated with lawsuits and other legal proceedings being uninsured. Our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected if a judgment, penalty or fine is not fully covered by insurance.
A privacy or data security breach could expose us to costly government enforcement actions and private litigation and adversely affect our business.
 An important component of our business involves the receipt, processing, transmittal, and storage of 
personal 
and confidential information about our customers. We have programs in place to detect, contain and respond to data security incidents. However, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures. In addition, hardware, software, or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security. Unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities, or those of third parties with whom we do business, through fraud, trickery, or other forms of deceiving our team members, contractors, vendors, and temporary staff. In addition, security breaches can also occur as a result of intentional or inadvertent breaches by our employees or by persons with whom we have commercial relationships. Any actual or suspected security breach or other compromise of our security measures or those of our third party vendors, whether as a result of banking efforts, denial-of-service attacks, viruses, malicious software, break-ins, phishing attacks, social engineering or otherwise, could harm our reputation and business, damage our brand and make it harder to retain existing customers or acquire new ones, require us to expend significant capital and other resources to address the breach, and result in a violation of applicable laws, regulations or other legal obligations. Moreover, any insurance coverage we may carry may be inadequate to cover the expenses and other potential financial exposure we could face as a result of a privacy or data breach.

Our business is subject to government regulation in various areas, and the increasing costs of compliance efforts, as well as any potential non-compliance, could adversely impact our business.
 We are subject to laws and regulations affecting our operations in a number of areas, including consumer protection, labor and employment, data privacy, product safety, and environmental. Compliance with these and similar laws and regulations may require significant effort and expense, and variances and inconsistencies in requirements among jurisdictions may exacerbate this effort and expense. Because the Company’s products and services are available over the Internet anywhere in the world, multiple jurisdictions may claim that the Company is required to do business as a foreign corporation in one or more of those jurisdictions. Failure to qualify as a foreign corporation in a jurisdiction where the Company is required to do so could subject it to taxes and penalties. States or foreign governments may charge the Company with violations of local laws. The time and expense of compliance with existing and future regulations could, in the aggregate, adversely affect our results of operations, limit our product and service offerings in one or more regions, constrain our marketing efforts, or otherwise cause us to change or limit our business practices.
We have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance that our customers, employees, contractors, vendors, franchisees, or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or our policies and procedures. If we are held responsible for any such violations, we could incur substantial aggregate expense from monetary penalties, resolution of customer claims, higher insurance premiums, and the time and expense of addressing any such violation, which could be material to us. Additionally, we could experience reputational harm as a result of any such violations.
Failure to comply with federal, state and international laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection and consumer protection, or the expansion of current or the enactment of new laws or regulations relating to privacy, data protection and consumer protection, could adversely affect our business and our financial condition. 
A variety of federal, state and international laws and regulations govern the collection, use, retention, sharing, export and security of personal information. These include laws and regulations that are intended to protect the privacy of children online, including the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, a U.S. federal law that requires websites and online services to obtain parental consent before collecting personal information from children under 13, as well as regulations adopted by the Federal Trade Commission, and a growing array of state laws. We also may choose to comply with, or may be required to comply with, self-regulatory obligations or other industry standards. Laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection and consumer protection are evolving and subject to potentially differing interpretations, and laws providing for new privacy and security rights and requirements may overlap with each other, and may be enacted or come into effect in different jurisdictions. These requirements may be enacted, interpreted or applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another or in a manner that conflicts with other rules or our practices. As a result, some of our practices may be in conflict, or may not comply in the future with all such evolving laws, regulations, requirements and obligations. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with any federal, state or international privacy or consumer protection-related laws, regulations, regulatory guidance, orders to which we may be subject or other legal obligations relating to privacy or consumer protection could adversely affect our reputation, brand and business, and may result in claims, proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others, including claims for statutory damages asserted on behalf of purported classes of affected persons or other liabilities or require us to change our business practices, including changing, limiting or ceasing altogether the collection, use, sharing, or transfer of data relating to customers, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.

Many governmental regulations may impact the Internet, which could affect the Company’s ability to conduct business. 
Any new law or regulation, or the application or interpretation of existing laws, may adversely impact the growth in the use of the Internet or the Company’s websites. The Company expects there will be an increasing number of laws and regulations pertaining to the Internet in the United States and throughout the world. These laws or regulations may relate to liability for information received from or transmitted over the Internet, online content regulation, user privacy, age-appropriate design, taxation and quality of products and services sold over the Internet. Moreover, the applicability to the Internet of existing laws governing intellectual property ownership and infringement, copyright, trademark, trade secret, obscenity, libel, employment, personal privacy and other issues is uncertain and developing. This could decrease the demand for the Company’s products, increase its costs or otherwise adversely affect its business.
Our business is subject to evolving corporate governance and public disclosure regulations and expectations.
 We are subject to evolving rules and regulations promulgated by a number of federal, state, and local governmental and self-regulatory organizations, including the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), the Nasdaq Stock Exchange and the Financial Accounting Standards Board. These rules and regulations continue to increase in scope and complexity, making compliance more difficult, expensive and uncertain. In addition, public companies are encountering increased scrutiny on ESG matters and related disclosures. These changing rules, regulations and stakeholder expectations have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and increased management time and attention spent complying with or meeting such regulations and expectations. For example, developing and acting on initiatives within the scope of ESG, and collecting, measuring and reporting ESG-related information and metrics can be costly, difficult and time consuming and is subject to evolving reporting standards. We could be criticized, fined or suffer other adverse consequences based on the inaccuracy, inadequacy or incompleteness of our reporting. If our ESG-related data, processes and reporting are incomplete or inaccurate, or if we otherwise fail to comply with ESG-related regulations, our reputation, business, financial performance and growth could be adversely affected.
The price at which the Company’s Class A common stock will trade may be highly volatile and may fluctuate substantially. 
The stock market has from time to time experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices of securities, particularly securities of companies with Internet operations. As a result, investors may experience a material decline in the market price of the Company’s Class A common stock, regardless of the Company’s operating performance. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company. The Company may become involved in this type of litigation in the future. Litigation of this type is often expensive and diverts management’s attention and resources and could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business and its results of operations.
Item 1B.    Unresolved Staff Comments
We have received no written comments regarding our current or periodic reports from the staff of the SEC that were issued 180 days or more preceding the end of our fiscal year ended June 29, 2025 that remain unresolved.
Item 1C. Cybersecurity
Risk Management and Strategy
In the ordinary course of our business, we utilize technology systems to collect, use, store, and transmit information. The confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the information in our systems is important to our operations, business strategy, and maintaining the trust of our customers, employees and partners. 
As 
part of our enterprise risk management program
, we have processes in place to identify, assess, and manage material risks associated with cybersecurity threats, as such term is defined in Item 106(a) of Regulation S-K.
Our cybersecurity team engages with applicable personnel across the enterprise and utilizes software tools to identify, categorize, and quantify material cybersecurity threat risks. The team meets regularly to consider new, known, and evolving risks and evaluate the measures in place to mitigate these risks.
Our strategy for managing cybersecurity risk is multifaceted and includes, without limitation: (i) robust security policies and procedures, designed in part to comply with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS), (ii) an incident response plan backed with industry-leading incident response support services, (iii) comprehensive system security vulnerability scanning, and oversight by a 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year Securities Operation Center; (iv) periodic cybersecurity awareness training and testing for employees and certain contractors; (v) 
risk management of our third-party suppliers, vendors, and other partners
, which includes risk-based diligence and contractual provisions that generally allow for periodic auditing, and (vi) security assessments of any businesses that we acquire.

 The Committee comprises Board members with particular expertise in technology and management, equipping them to oversee cybersecurity risks effectively.
The Committee is responsible for the oversight of the Company’s policies and procedures intended to provide security, confidentiality, availability, and integrity of the Company’s information, including with respect to data privacy and the Company’s compliance with applicable data privacy and cybersecurity laws and regulations. The Committee also oversees the quality and effectiveness of the Company’s policies and procedures with respect to its information technology systems and provides oversight on the Company’s policies and procedures in maintaining preparedness for responding to any material incidents. The Committee also periodically coordinates with the Company’s Audit Committee, which reviews risks related to the Company’s information technology systems, including privacy, network security and data security.
The Company’s program to identify, assess, and manage cybersecurity risks is currently led by our 
Senior Vice President, IT Operations
, and leverages the expertise of our Chief Financial Officer and General Counsel.
 
Our Senior Vice President, IT Operations holds a Bachelor of Business Administration in Business Computer Information Systems and has over 20 years of work experience, with more than 5 years in senior executive roles involving managing information systems, including implementing effective information and cybersecurity programs.

This “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” (MD&A) is intended to provide an understanding of our financial condition, change in financial condition, cash flow, liquidity and results of operations. The following MD&A discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to those statements that appear elsewhere in this Form 10-K. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect the Company’s plans, estimates and beliefs. The Company’s actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to any differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed under Item 1A — “Risk Factors.”
Business Overview
The Company is a leading provider of gifts designed to help inspire customers to give more, connect more, and build more and better relationships. See 
Item 1
 in Part I for a detailed description of the Company’s business.
Business Segments
The Company operates in the following three business segments: Consumer Floral & Gifts, Gourmet Foods & Gift Baskets, and BloomNet. The Consumer Floral & Gifts segment includes the operations of the Company’s flagship brand, 1-800-Flowers.com, Personalization Mall, Things Remembered, FruitBouquets.com, Flowerama and Alice’s Table, while the Gourmet Foods & Gift Baskets segment includes the operations of Harry & David, Wolferman’s Bakery, Vital Choice, Moose Munch, Cheryl’s Cookies, Mrs. Beasley’s, The Popcorn Factory, DesignPac, 1-800-Baskets.com, Simply Chocolate, Shari’s Berries, and Scharffen Berger. The BloomNet segment includes the operations of BloomNet, Napco, and Card Isle.
Fiscal 2025 Results
Fiscal 2025 was a challenging year from a top and bottom line perspective. The broader macro-economic conditions have continued to impact our consumers. We have seen consumer confidence and sentiment decline in response to various uncertainties, including potential tariff impacts on inflation, a softening labor market, and shifting economic policies. 
During fiscal 2025, net revenues decreased by $145.8 million, or 8.0%, to $1,685.7 million, compared to fiscal 2024, primarily due to continued slowing demand for everyday gifting occasions as discretionary income remains under pressure and consumers continue to moderate their spending. In addition, the Company experienced a highly promotional consumer environment during the holidays.
Gross margins declined throughout the year, ending at 38.7%; a 140-basis point decrease over fiscal 2024, primarily due to higher cost of merchandise and deleveraging of fixed costs.
Net loss was $200.0 million, compared with a net loss of $6.1 million in fiscal 2024. Adjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2025 was $29.2 million, compared with $93.1 million in fiscal 2024, reflecting a decline in Adjusted EBITDA of $63.9 million, driven by lower sales, reduced gross margin and increased advertising costs (See Reconciliation of net loss to adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) below).
Goodwill and Intangible Asset Impairment
During the quarter ended March 30, 2025, the Company evaluated whether events or circumstances had changed such that  it was more likely than not that the fair value of its goodwill, intangibles, and other long-lived assets were less than their carrying amounts. After consideration of then current operating results, changes in macro-economic conditions, and a decline in the Company’s market capitalization, the Company concluded that a triggering event had occurred for its Consumer Floral & Gifts reporting unit. As such, the Company performed an impairment test of the reporting unit’s goodwill, intangibles and long-lived assets as of March 30, 2025, and
 recorded a non-cash goodwill and intangible impairment charge of 
$138.2 million
, 
comprised of $113.4 million related to goodwill 
and 
$24.8 million
 attributable to the 
Personalization Mall tradename (indefinite-lived intangible asset). The Company concluded that definite-lived and other long-lived assets of the reporting unit were not impaired. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, the Company recorded an immaterial adjustment of $5.6 million to increase the previously recognized non-cash goodwill impairment charge. The adjustment was the result of a change in the estimated allocation of the impairment charge between goodwill that is deductible and non-deductible for tax purposes.
25
Table of Contents
In fiscal 2024, during the quarter ended December 31, 2023
, 
as a result of a decline in the actual and projected revenue for the Company’s Personalization Mall tradename, as well as a higher discount rate resulting from the higher interest rate environment, the Company determined that an impairment assessment was required for this tradename. This assessment resulted in the Company recording a non-cash impairment charge of $19.8 million to reduce the recorded carrying value of the Personalization Mall tradename. 
During the third quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company evaluated whether events or circumstances had changed such that it would indicate it was more likely than not that its goodwill, intangibles and other long-lived assets of the Gourmet Foods & Gift Baskets reporting units fair values were less than their carrying amounts. After considering the continuing pressures on consumer discretionary spending, ongoing geopolitical events, the current inflationary macro-economic conditions, related cost input headwinds that have negatively impacted the Company’s gross margins, and resulting downward revisions to its forecast, the Company concluded that a triggering event had occurred for its Gourmet Foods & Gift Baskets reporting unit. As such, the Company performed an impairment test of the reporting unit’s goodwill, intangibles and long-lived assets as of April 2, 2023, and recorded a non-cash adjustment to fully impair the related goodwill of $62.3 million, and partially impaired certain tradenames totaling $2.3 million within the reporting unit

Acquisition of Scharffen Berger
On July 1, 2024, the Company completed its acquisition of certain assets of Scharffen Berger®, a chocolate manufacturing company, expanding the Company's product offerings in the Gourmet Foods & Gift Baskets Segment. The Company used cash on its balance sheet to fund the approximately $3.3 million purchase. Scharffen Berger annual revenues and results of operations, based on its most recently available financial information at the time of acquisition, are deemed immaterial to the Company's consolidated financial statements and, as such, pro forma results of operations have not been presented -

Note 4 – Acquisitions in Item 15
.
Acquisition of Card Isle
On April 3, 2024, the Company completed its acquisition of certain assets of Card Isle, an e-commerce greeting card company, expanding the Company’s presence in the greeting card category across all brands. The Company used cash on its balance sheet to fund the $3.6 million purchase. Card Isle annual revenue and results of operations, based on its most recently available financial information at the time of acquisition, are deemed immaterial to the Company's consolidated financial statements – see 
Note 4 – Acquisitions in Item 15
.
Acquisition of Things Remembered
On January 10, 2023, the Company completed its acquisition of certain assets of the Things Remembered brand, a provider of personalized gifts, whose operations have been integrated within the PersonalizationMall.com brand, in the Consumer Floral & Gifts segment. The Company used cash on its balance sheet to fund the $5.0 million purchase, which included intellectual property, a customer list, certain inventory, and equipment. The acquisition did not include Things Remembered retail stores. Things Remembered’s annual revenues from its e-commerce operations, based on its most recently available unaudited financial information at the time of the acquisition was $30.4 million for the twelve months ended November 30, 2022

Note 4 – Acquisitions in Item 15

Fiscal 2026
The Company is approaching fiscal 2026 as a pivotal period of foundation setting. By transforming the Company into a customer-centric, data-driven organization with clear objectives and return on investment-focused decision making, the Company aims to position itself to support its multi-year Celebrations strategy and fuel future growth. 
The Company's strategic priorities are focused on positioning the organization for long-term growth. These priorities include:
•
driving cost savings and organizational efficiency,
•
building a customer-centric and data-driven organization,
•
broadening our reach beyond our e-commerce sites into new channels, and 
•
strengthening our team through enhanced talent and accountability. 
26
Table of Contents
With a renewed commitment to agility and customer-centricity, the Company believes these foundational steps will set the stage for sustainable revenue and profit growth in the years to come.
Definitions of non-GAAP financial measures:
We sometimes use financial measures derived from consolidated financial information, but not presented in our financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). Certain of these are considered “non-GAAP financial measures” under the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules. See below for definitions and the reasons why we use these non-GAAP financial measures, and reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are referred to as “non-GAAP”, “adjusted” or “on a comparable basis” below, as these terms are used interchangeably. Reconciliations for forward-looking figures would require unreasonable efforts at this time because of the uncertainty and variability of the nature and amount of certain components of various necessary GAAP components, including, for example, those related to compensation, tax items, amortization or others that may arise during the year, and the Company’s management believes such reconciliations would imply a degree of precision that would be confusing or misleading to investors. For the same reasons, the Company is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information. The lack of such reconciling information should be considered when assessing the impact of such disclosures.
EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA
We define EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA adjusted for the impact of stock-based compensation, Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan ("NQDC Plan") investment appreciation/depreciation, and certain items affecting period-to-period comparability. 
The Company presents EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA because it considers such information meaningful supplemental measures of its performance and believes such information is frequently used by the investment community in the evaluation of similarly situated companies. The Company uses EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as factors used to determine the total amount of incentive compensation available to be awarded to executive officers and other employees. The Company’s credit agreement uses EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA-related metrics to determine its interest rate and to measure compliance with certain covenants. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are also used by the Company to evaluate and price potential acquisition candidates.
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company’s results as reported under GAAP. Some of the limitations are: (a) EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, the Company’s working capital needs; (b) EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on the Company’s debts; and (c) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future and EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such capital expenditures. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should only be used on a supplemental basis combined with GAAP results when evaluating the Company’s performance.

Adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted or comparable net income (loss) per common share
We define adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted or comparable net income (loss) per common share as net income (loss) and net income (loss) per common share adjusted for certain items affecting period-to-period comparability. We believe that adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted or comparable net income (loss) per common share are meaningful measures because they increase the comparability of period-to-period results. Since these are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, they should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, GAAP net income (loss) and net income (loss) per common share, as indicators of operating performance and they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.

Segment contribution margin and adjusted segment contribution margin
We define segment contribution margin as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, before the allocation of corporate overhead expenses. Adjusted segment contribution margin is defined as contribution margin adjusted for certain items affecting period-to-period comparability. When viewed together with our GAAP results, we believe segment contribution margin and adjusted segment contribution margin provide management and users of the financial statements meaningful information about the performance of our business segments.
Segment contribution margin and adjusted segment contribution margin are used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP and should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures. The material limitation associated with the use of segment contribution margin and adjusted segment contribution margin is that they are an incomplete measure of profitability as they do not include all operating expenses or non-operating income and expenses. Management compensates for this limitation when using this measure by looking at other GAAP measures, such as Operating Income (loss) and Net Income (loss).

Table of Contents
(a)
Segment performance is measured based on segment contribution margin or segment Adjusted EBITDA, reflecting only the direct controllable revenue and operating expenses of the segments, both of which are non-GAAP measurements. As such, management’s measure of profitability for these segments does not include the effect of corporate overhead, described above, depreciation and amortization, other income (net), and other items that we do not consider indicative of our core operating performance.
(b)
Corporate expenses consist of the Company’s enterprise shared service cost centers, and include, among other items, Information Technology, Human Resources, Accounting and Finance, Legal, Executive and Customer Service Center functions, stock-based compensation, as well as changes in the fair value of the Company's NQDC Plan. In order to leverage the Company’s infrastructure, these functions are operated under a centralized management platform, providing support services throughout the organization. The costs of these functions, other than those of the Customer Service Center, which are allocated directly to the above categories based upon usage, are included within corporate expenses as they are not directly allocable to a specific segment.
(c)
See reconciliation of the Company's net loss to Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) above.
Free Cash Flow
We define Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, less capital expenditures. The Company considers Free Cash Flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after the purchases of fixed assets, which can then be used to, among other things, invest in the Company’s business, make strategic acquisitions, strengthen the balance sheet and repurchase stock or retire debt. Free Cash Flow is a liquidity measure that is frequently used by the investment community in the evaluation of similarly situated companies. Since Free Cash Flow is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, it should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company’s results as reported under GAAP. A limitation of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of financial performance is that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in the Company’s cash balance for the period.
The following table reconciles net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, a GAAP measure, to free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure.

Net revenues consist primarily of the selling price of the merchandise, service or outbound shipping charges, less discounts, returns and credits. The Company’s net revenues from international sources were not material during fiscal years 2025, 2024 and 2023.
During the fiscal year ended June 29, 2025, net revenues decreased 
8.0%
 in comparison to the prior year, 
due to lower order volume across all segments, reflecting a continuation of the trend we have experienced over the past few years as discretionary income remains pressured and consumers continue to moderate their spending. In addition, the Company experienced the impact of inefficient marketing spend, as well as a highly promotional consumer environment during the holidays.
During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, net revenues decreased 9.2% in comparison to the prior year, due to lower order volume across all segments, as discretionary income remained pressured and consumers continued to moderate their spending. Contributing to this decline was the prudent use of advertising spend, to balance the long-term goals of the Company with strategies to improve gross margins and tightly control operating expenses during this challenging economic environment.

Revenue by sales channel:
•
E-commerce revenues (combined online and telephonic)
 decreased 9.3% during fiscal 2025, primarily as a result of a decline in demand acro
ss all our segments, attributable to the macro-economic conditions noted above, the impact of inefficient marketing spend, and a highly promotional consumer environment. The Company had lower order volumes (17.3 million, -8.2% vs. prior year) coupled with slightly lower average order value ($84.72, -1.1% vs prior year) as a result of product mix trending into lower price point items.
E-commerce revenues decreased 7.5% during fiscal 2024, primarily as a result of a decline in demand for “Everyday” gifts across all our segments, attributable to the macro-economic conditions noted above, which negatively impacted consumer discretionary spending, combined with planned reductions in advertising spend. Lower order volumes (18.8 million, -9.9% vs. prior year) were slightly offset by higher average order value ($85.70, +2.7% vs prior year) as a result of product mix trending into higher price point items, including bundles, and customer mix with higher income customers buying at a higher rate than lower income customers.
•
Other revenues
 are comprised of the Company’s BloomNet segment, as well as the wholesale and retail channels of its Consumer Floral & Gifts and Gourmet Foods & Gift Baskets segments.
Other reve
nues increased 1.8% dur
ing fiscal 
2025
 primarily due to higher wholesale volumes within the Gourmet Foods & Gift Baskets segment due to increased orders from bi
g box retailers, which was partially offset by lower BloomNet revenues due to lower order volume through the network, including our 1-800-Flowers® brand.

Table of Contents
Other revenues 
decreased 20.5%
 during fiscal 
2024
 primarily due to lower order volume from big box retailers, as well as lower BloomNet Wholesale and Service revenues. 
The lower service revenues were due to lower shop-to-shop volumes.
Revenue by segment:
Consumer Floral & Gifts
 – this segment, which includes the operations of the 1-800-Flowers.com®, Personalization  Mall®, Things Remembered® and Alice’s Table brands®, derives revenue from the sale of consumer floral products and gifts through its e-commerce sales channels (telephonic and online sales), retail stores, and royalties from its franchise operations.
Net revenues decreased 8.6% during fiscal 2025, due to the continued macro-economic pressure, a highly promotional consumer environment, and the impact of inefficient marketing spend.
Net revenues decreased 7.7% during fiscal 2024, due to the continued reduction of “Everyday” product demand, and weaker than anticipated Valentine’s Day and Mother’s Day demand, as consumers’ discretionary spending remained cautious in the inflationary environment, combined with planned reductions in advertising spend, as our brands focused their efforts on improving gross margin and operating spend efficiency, in the face of softening demand. 
BloomNet®
 – revenues in this segment are derived from membership fees, as well as other product and service offerings.
Net revenues decreased 8.4% during fiscal 2025, due to lower service revenue, which was attributable to a decline in order volume processed through the network, as well as lower wholesale product sales.
Net revenues decreased 19.1% during fiscal 2024, due to soft wholesale product sales, as the result of weakness in demand across the industry and lower service revenue. The lower service revenue was attributable to reduced membership/transaction fee revenues, as well as lower florist-to-florist revenue associated with a decline in order volume processed through the network, and lower directory services ad revenues.
Gourmet Foods & Gift Baskets
 – this segment includes the operations of Harry & David®, Wolferman’s Bakery®, Cheryl’s Cookies®, The Popcorn Factory®, 1-800-Baskets.com®/DesignPac®, Shari’s Berries®, Vital Choice®, and since July 1, 2024, Scharffen Berger®. Revenue is derived from the sale of gourmet fruits, cookies, baked gifts, premium chocolates and confections, gourmet popcorn, gift baskets, dipped berries, prime steaks, chops, and fish, through the Company’s e-commerce sales channels (telephonic and online sales) and company-owned and operated retail stores under the Harry & David and Cheryl’s Cookies brand names, as well as wholesale operations.
Net revenues decreased 7.2% during fiscal 2025, as e-commerce revenues declined 10.1% due to lower demand and the impact of inefficient marketing spend, partially offset by increased wholesale volume as big box retailers increased orders in the current year. In addition, the implementation of a new order management system for our Harry & David brand negatively impacted sales during the holiday period in fiscal 2025.
Net revenues decreased 9.4% during fiscal 2024, as e-commerce declined 7.2% due to lower consumer demand, as a result of macro-economic weakness, which significantly reduced “Everyday” occasion volumes, combined with planned reductions in advertising spend, as the brands focused their efforts on improving gross margins and operating spend efficiency in the face of softening demand. The unfavorable revenue trend was attributable to lower order volume, partially offset by favorable average order value as a result of product mix including more bundles and other higher priced offerings as higher income customers continued to buy at a higher rate. Wholesale/Retail channel revenues were unfavorable to prior year primarily due to lower order volume from big box retailers.

Gross profit consists of net revenues less cost of revenues, which is comprised primarily of florist fulfillment costs (fees paid directly to florists), the cost of floral and non-floral merchandise sold from inventory or through third parties, and associated costs, including inbound and outbound shipping charges. Additionally, cost of revenues includes labor and facility costs related to direct-to-consumer and wholesale production operations, as well as payments made to sending florists related to order volume referred through the Company’s BloomNet network.
Gross profit 
decreased 11.2%
 during fiscal 
2025
 due to lower revenues, as well as a decline in gross margin of 140 basis points compared with fiscal 2024 due to declines within the Consumer Floral & Gifts and the Gourmet Foods & Gift Baskets segments, partially offset by an increase in gross profit in the Company's BloomNet segment.
Gross profit 
decreased 3.0%
 during fiscal 
2024
 due to the lower revenues noted above, partially offset by a higher gross margin percentage, driven by f
avorable product mix, lower freight costs, a decline in commodity costs, and the Company’s logistics optimization efforts. Gross margins improved throughout the year ending at 40.1%; a 260-basis point improvement over fiscal 2023.
Consumer Floral & Gifts segment
 – Gross profit in fiscal 2025 in comparison to prior year decreased by 11.9%, due to the impact of the lower revenues noted above, as well as an unfavorable gross profit percentage primarily attributable to higher cost of merchandise and deleveraging of fixed costs resulting from lower sales volumes. 
Gross profit in 
fiscal 
2024 decreased
 in comparison to prior year by 4.5%, due to t
he unfavorable revenues noted above, partially offset by favorable gross profit percentage attributable to favorable product mix into higher margin direct fulfilled sales, favorable fulfillment costs, as well as lower inbound and outbound shipping cost.
BloomNet segment
 – Gross profit in fiscal 2025 from the BloomNet segment decreased in comparison to prior year by 7.9%, due to the impact of lower revenues noted above, offset in part by improved gross profit percentage driven by lower florist rebates related to lower florist-to-florist volume. 
Gross profit in fiscal 2024 from the BloomNet segment decreased in comparison to prior year by 8.6%, due to the unfavorable revenues noted above, partially offset by an increase in gross margin percentage. Gross margin percentage was higher than prior year due to lower florist rebates, which was driven by the lower shop-to-shop volume mainly from partners that carried higher contracted rates. In addition, wholesale margins, improved as a result of strategic pricing initiatives and lower cost of merchandise due to more favorable ocean freight rates.
Gourmet Foods & Gift Baskets segment
 – Gross profit in fiscal 2025 decreased in comparison to prior year by 9.0%, due to the decrease in revenue noted above, as well as decreased gross profit percentage attributable to higher cost of merchandise, deleveraging of fixed costs resulting from lower sales volumes, and incremental costs associated with the implementation of a new order management system for the Harry & David brand. 
Gross profit in fiscal 2024 decreased in comparison to prior year by 0.6%, due to the unfavorable revenues noted above, partially offset by favorable gross profit percentage. The favorable gross profit percentage was primarily due to lower delivery and shipping costs as logistical initiatives allowed the group to decrease shipping costs. Favorable cost of merchandise (favorable inbound ocean freight and lower commodity costs), along with the Company's inventory and labor optimization efforts, also contributed to the improved margin percentage. In addition, the brand benefited from favorable product mix due to the continued gap in buying behavior of higher income customers continuing to purchase higher priced merchandise with strong margins, while lower income customers continue to tighten their discretionary spending.

Marketing and sales expense consists primarily of advertising and promotional expenditures, catalog costs, online portal and search costs, retail store and fulfillment operations (other than costs included in cost of revenues) and customer service center expenses, as well as the operating expenses of the Company’s departments engaged in marketing, selling, and merchandising activities. 
Marketing and sales expense decreased 0.9% during fiscal 2025, essentially in-line with the prior year. Marketing and sales expenses as a percentage of revenues increased over the prior year due to increased advertising costs needed to support sales due to a competitive environment. 
Marketing and sales expense
 decreased 3.2% 
during fiscal 2024 due to lower variable portal expenses and labor efficiencies, which was partially offset by higher general advertising expenses, as the brands reallocated dollars from less effective bottom of the funnel advertising to other areas to generate additional revenue in a challenging and competitive environment.

Income Taxes
The Company recorded an income tax benefit of 
$13.4 million
 during fiscal 
2025
, an income tax expense of $0.2 million in fiscal 
2024
, and an income tax benefit of $2.1 million in fiscal 
2023
, resulting in an effective tax rat
e of 6.3%, (3.4%)
 and 4.4%, respectively. 
The Company’s effective tax rate for fiscal 2025 differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21.0% primarily due to establishing a valuation allowance on certain federal and state deferred tax assets (including charitable contribution carryforwards) and the permanent portion of goodwill impairment charges. The Company’s effective tax rate for fiscal 2024 differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21.0% primarily due to state taxes, increases in valuation allowances, and tax shortfalls related to stock-based compensation, partially offset by enhanced deductions and various tax credits. The Company’s effective tax rate for fiscal 2023 differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21.0% primarily due to the impact of the non-deductible portion of the Company’s impairment charge, as well as state income taxes and non-deductible expenses for executive compensation, tax shortfalls related to stock-based compensation, partially offset by enhanced deductions and various tax credits. 
At June 29, 2025, the Company had $22.0 million of indefinite lived federal net operating losses, $110.4 million of state net operating loss carryforwards, some of which will begin to expire in fiscal 2026 to the extent not utilized and $5.4 million of foreign net operating loss carryforward which will begin to expire in fiscal 2034 if not utilized. At June 29, 2025, the Company’s federal charitable contribution carryforwards were $21.9 million, which will begin to expire in fiscal 2027 if not utilized. At June 29, 2025, the Company’s research and development and work opportunity credit carryforwards were $0.6 million and $0.1 million, respectively, which will both begin to expire in fiscal 2045 if not utilized.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity and borrowings
The Company’s principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flows generated from operations, and borrowings available under the Company’s credit agreement (see 
Note 10 - Long-Term Debt, Net in Part IV, Item 15
 for details). At June 29, 2025, the Company had working capital
 of 
$61.3 million
, including cash and cash equivalents of 
$46.5 million, compared to net working capital of $157.9 million, including cash and cash equivalents of $159.4 million at June 30, 2024.
Due to the seasonal nature of the Company’s business, and its continued expansion into non-floral products, the Thanksgiving through Christmas holiday season, which falls within the Company’s second fiscal quarter, generates 
over 40% of
 the Company’s annual revenues, and all of its earnings. Due to the number of major floral gifting occasions, including Mother’s Day, Valentine’s Day, Easter and Administrative Professionals Week, revenues also have historically risen during the Company’s fiscal third and fourth quarters in comparison to its fiscal first quarter.
During the first two quarters of fiscal 2025, the Company borrowed under its revolving credit facility in order to fund pre-holiday manufacturing and inventory procurement requirements, with borrowings peaking at $110.0 million in November 2024. Cash generated from operations during the Christmas holiday shopping season enabled the Company to repay the borrowings under the revolving credit facility in December 2024. The Company had no amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility as of June 29, 2025. In addition, during fiscal 2025, the Company made payments of $30.0 million on its Term Loan, which included a $25.0 million voluntary prepayment.
Based on our year-end cash balances, combined with projected cash flows, the Company expects to borrow under its revolving credit facility to fund pre-holiday manufacturing and inventory purchases during the first quarter of fiscal 2026. The Company expects to be able to repay all working capital borrowings prior to the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2026.
While we believe that our sources of funding will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next twelve months, any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. We continually evaluate, and will, from time to time, consider the acquisition of, or investment in, complementary businesses, products, services, capital infrastructure, and technologies, which might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to require additional financing.
Cash Flows 
Net cash used for operating activities of $26.4 million for fiscal 2025 was primarily attributable to uses of cash for working capital purposes, comprised of decreases in accounts payable and accrued expenses and increases in trade receivables and prepaid and other.
Net cash used in investing activities of $44.5 million was attributable to capital expenditures primarily related to the Company's technology and automation initiatives, and the acquisition of Scharffen Berger as noted above.
Net cash used in financing activities of $42.1 million related primarily to net repayment of bank borrowings of $30.0 million, which included a $25.0 million voluntary prepayment on the Company's term loan, and the acquisition of treasury stock of $10.2 million.
Free Cash Flow
Free cash flow was a negative $67.8 million for fiscal 2025, compared with free cash flow of positive $56.4 million for fiscal 2024, a decrease of $124.2 million primarily driven by a decrease in cash flows from operations, driven by lower net income, adjusted for non-cash items, as well as timing of changes in working capital.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The Company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements of 1-800-FLOWERS.COM, Inc., which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Our accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 of the financial statements. As disclosed in Note 2, the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and 
assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management bases its estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, and management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. 
Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We consider accounting estimates to be critical if both: (i) the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved, and (ii) the impact within a reasonable range of outcomes of the estimate and assumption is material to the Company’s financial condition. Our critical accounting policies and estimates are the same and relate to goodwill and other intangible assets. Management of the Company has discussed the selection of critical accounting estimates and the effect of estimates with the audit committee of the Company’s Board of Directors.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in each business combination, with the carrying value of the Company’s goodwill allocated to its reporting units, in accordance with the acquisition method of accounting. Goodwill is not amortized, but it is subject to an annual assessment for impairment, which the Company performs during the fourth quarter, or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change such that it is more likely than not that an impairment may exist. The Company tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level. The Company identifies its reporting units by assessing whether the components of its operating segments constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available and management of each reporting unit regularly reviews the operating results of those components.
In applying the goodwill impairment test, the Company has the option to perform a qualitative test (also known as “Step 0”) or a quantitative test (“Step 1”). Under the Step 0 test, the Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Qualitative factors may include, but are not limited to, economic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance of the reporting unit and other entity and reporting unit specific events. If after assessing these qualitative factors, the Company determines it is “more-likely-than-not” that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, then performing the Step 1 quantitative test is necessary.
Step 1 of the quantitative test requires comparison of the fair value of each of the reporting units to the respective carrying value. If the carrying value of the reporting unit is less than the fair value, no impairment exists. Otherwise, the Company would recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value up to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.
39
Table of Contents
The Company generally estimates the fair value of a reporting unit using an equal weighting of the income and market approaches. The Company uses industry accepted valuation models and set criteria that are reviewed and approved by various levels of management. Under the income approach, the Company uses a discounted cash flow methodology, which requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to forecasted revenues, gross profit margins, operating income margins, working capital cash flow, perpetual growth rates, and long-term discount rates, among others. For the market approach, the Company uses the guideline public company method. Under this method, the Company utilizes information from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting units, to create valuation multiples that are applied to the operating performance of the reporting unit being tested, in order to obtain their respective fair values. The Company also reconciles the aggregate fair values of its reporting units determined in the first step (as described above) to its current market capitalization, allowing for a reasonable control premium. 
During fiscal 2025, the Company recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of 
$119.0 million
 related to the 
Company’s Consumer Floral & Gifts reporting unit.
 
The goodwill was written down to its respective fair value resulting in zero excess fair value over carrying amount as of the impairment test date, resulting in a risk of future impairments if any assumptions (including changes in segments), estimates, or market factors change in the future.
 
The carrying value of the Company’s Consumer Floral & Gifts reporting unit as of June 29, 2025, is $34.6 million.
 
See
 
Note 7 – Goodwill and Other Intangibles, Net 
in Part IV, Item 15, for further information.
Other Intangibles, net
Other intangibles consist of definite-lived intangible assets (such as investment in licenses, customer lists, and others) and indefinite-lived intangible assets (such as acquired tradenames and trademarks). The cost of definite-lived intangible assets is amortized to reflect the pattern of economic benefits consumed, over the estimated periods benefited, ranging from 3 to 16 years, while indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized.
Definite-lived intangibles are reviewed for impairment whenever changes in circumstances or events may indicate that the carrying amounts are not recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances occur, a recoverability test is performed comparing projected undiscounted cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of an asset or asset group to its carrying value. If the projected undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value, then an impairment charge would be recorded for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value, which is determined by discounting future cash flows.
The Company tests indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually, during the fourth quarter, or whenever changes in circumstances or events may indicate that the carrying amounts are not recoverable. In applying the impairment test, the Company has the option to perform a qualitative test (also known as “Step 0”) or a quantitative test. Under the Step 0 test, the Company assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. Qualitative factors may include, but are not limited, to economic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, financial performance, legal and other entity and asset specific events. If, after assessing these qualitative factors, the Company determines it is “more-likely-than-not” that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired, then performing the quantitative test is necessary. The quantitative impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets encompasses calculating a fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset and comparing the fair value to its carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, impairment is recognized for the difference. To determine fair value of other indefinite-lived intangible assets, the Company uses an income approach, the relief-from-royalty method. This method assumes that, in lieu of ownership, a third party would be willing to pay a royalty in order to obtain the rights to use the comparable asset. Other indefinite-lived intangible assets’ fair values require significant judgments in determining both the assets’ estimated cash flows, including the perpetual growth rate,  as well as the appropriate discount and royalty rates applied to those cash flows to determine fair value.
During fiscal 2025, the Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of 
$24.8 million
 related to the 
Company’s Personalization Mall tradename.
 
The indefinite-lived intangible was written down to its respective fair value resulting in zero excess fair value over carrying amount as of the impairment test date, resulting in a risk of future impairments if any assumptions, estimates, or market factors change in the future.
 
The carrying value of the Company’s Personalization Mall tradename as of June 29, 2025, is $21.2 million.

Item 7A.     QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
The Company is exposed to market risk from the effect of interest rate changes, which relates primarily to the Company’s investment of available cash balances and its long-term debt. The Company generally invests its cash and cash equivalents in investment grade corporate and U.S. government securities. Borrowings under the Company’s credit facilities bear interest at a variable rate, plus an applicable margin, and therefore expose the Company to market risk for changes in interest rates. The effect of a 50 basis point increase in current interest rates on the Company’s interest expense would have been approximately $1.0 million d

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company’s principal executive and principal financial officers and effectuated by the Company’s Board of Directors, management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”), and includes those policies and procedures that:
•
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;
•
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made in accordance with authorization of management and directors of the Company; and
•
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
Board of Directors and Stockholders
1-800-FLOWERS.COM, Inc.
Jericho, NY
Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of 1-800-FLOWERS.COM, Inc. (the “Company”) as of June 29, 2025 and June 30, 2024, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss), stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended June 29, 2025, and the related notes and schedule listed in the accompanying index (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at June 29, 2025 and June 30, 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended June 29, 2025, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of June 29, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) and our report dated September 5, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. 
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
Valuation of Indefinite-lived Intangible Asset – Personalization Mall Tradename
As described in Note 2 and Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s consolidated balance for trademarks with indefinite lives was $86.7 million as of June 29, 2025. During its quarterly assessment in the third quarter of fiscal year 2025, the Company determined that an impairment assessment was required for its Personalization Mall 
F-1
Table of Contents
tradename. The Company’s impairment test for its Personalization Mall tradename encompassed calculating the fair value of the asset and comparing that result to its carrying value. To determine the fair value, the Company used an income approach, the relief-from-royalty method. This quarterly assessment resulted in the Company recording a non-cash impairment charge of $24.8 million. 
We identified the perpetual growth rate, discount rate, and royalty rate included in the relief-from-royalty method for the valuation of the Personalization Mall tradename during the third quarter of fiscal year 2025 as a critical audit matter. The principal considerations for our determination included the subjectivity and judgment required to determine the perpetual growth rate, discount rate and royalty rate. Auditing these elements involved especially challenging auditor judgment due to the nature and extent of audit effort required to address these matters, including the extent of specialized skills or knowledge needed.
The primary procedure we performed to address this critical audit matter included: 
•          Utilizing personnel with specialized skills and knowledge in valuation to assist in evaluating the reasonableness of the perpetual growth rate, discount rate, and royalty rate.
Valuation of Goodwill related to the Consumer Floral & Gifts Reporting Unit
As described in Note 2 and Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s consolidated balance for Goodwill was $37.6 million as of June 29, 2025. For fiscal year 2025, the Company’s goodwill impairment assessment resulted in the recording of a non-cash impairment charge of $119.0 million to reduce the recorded carrying value of the Consumer Floral & Gifts reporting unit. The Company’s impairment test for its Consumer Floral & Gifts reporting unit encompassed calculating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing that result to its carrying value. The Company estimated the fair value of the reporting unit using an equal weighting of the income approach and market approach. 
We identified the forecasted revenues, perpetual growth rate, and discount rate included in the valuation of the Consumer Floral & Gifts reporting unit during the fiscal year 2025 as a critical audit matter. The principal considerations for our determination included the subjectivity and judgment required to determine the forecasted revenues, perpetual growth rate, and discount rate. Auditing these elements involved especially challenging auditor judgment due to the nature and extent of audit effort required to address these matters, including the extent of specialized skills or knowledge needed.
The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included: 
•
Utilizing personnel with specialized skills and knowledge in valuation to assist in evaluating the reasonableness of the perpetual growth rate and the discount rate.
•
Evaluating the reasonableness of forecasted revenues by: (i) comparing the actual results for the historical years to the forecasted revenues, (ii) considering whether any contradictory evidence existed by reviewing industry trends, and (iii) benchmarking revenue growth rates for the public guideline companies that management used for its assessment.

Note 2. 
Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of 1800-FLOWERS.COM, Inc. and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company’s net revenues from international sources were not material during fiscal years 2025, 2024 and 2023.
Fiscal Year
The Company’s fiscal year is a 52- or 53-week period ending on the Sunday nearest to June 30. Fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023, which ended on June 29, 2025, June 30, 2024, and July 2, 2023, respectively, each consisted of 52 weeks.
 
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents consist of demand deposits with banks, highly liquid money market funds, United States government securities, overnight repurchase agreements and commercial paper with maturities of three months or less when purchased.
Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Inventories are accounted for using a standard costing methodology, which approximates cost on a first-in, first-out basis.
Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation expense is computed using the straight-line method over the assets’ estimated useful lives. Amortization of leasehold improvements and capital leases is computed using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful lives or the initial lease terms. The Company capitalizes certain internal and external costs incurred to acquire or develop internal-use software. Capitalized software costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the software. Orchards in production, consisting of direct labor and materials, supervision and other items, are capitalized as part of capital projects in progress until the orchards produce fruit in commercial quantities, at which time they are reclassified to orchards in production. Estimated useful lives are periodically reviewed, and where appropriate, changes are made prospectively.

Property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever changes in circumstances or events may indicate that the carrying amounts are not recoverable.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in each business combination, with the carrying value of the Company’s goodwill allocated to its reporting unit, in accordance with the acquisition method of accounting. Goodwill is not amortized, but it is subject to an annual assessment for impairment, which the Company performs during the fourth quarter, or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change such that it is more likely than not that an impairment may exist. The Company tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level. The Company identifies its reporting units by assessing whether the components of its operating segments constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available and management of each reporting unit regularly reviews the operating results of those components.
In applying the goodwill impairment test, the Company has the option to perform a qualitative test (also known as “Step 0”) or a quantitative test (“Step 1”). Under the Step 0 test, the Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Qualitative factors  may include, but are not limited to, economic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance of the reporting unit and other entity and reporting unit specific events. If after assessing these qualitative factors, the Company determines it is “more-likely-than-not” that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, then performing the Step 1 quantitative test is necessary.
Step 1 of the quantitative test requires comparison of the fair value of each of the reporting units to the respective carrying value. If the carrying value of the reporting unit is less than the fair value, no impairment exists. Otherwise, the Company would recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value up to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.
The Company generally estimates the fair value of a reporting unit using an equal weighting of the income and market approaches. The Company uses industry accepted valuation models and set criteria that are reviewed and approved by various levels of management. Under the income approach, the Company uses a discounted cash flow methodology, which requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to forecasted revenues, gross profit margins, operating income margins, working capital cash flow, perpetual growth rates, and long-term discount rates, among others. For the market approach, the Company uses the guideline public company method. Under this method, the Company utilizes information from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting units, to create valuation multiples that are applied to the operating performance of the reporting unit being tested, in order to obtain their respective fair values. The Company also reconciles the aggregate fair values of its reporting units determined in the first step (as described above) to its current market capitalization.
During its quarterly assessment in the third quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company concluded that a triggering event had occurred for its Gourmet Foods & Gift Baskets reporting unit. As such, the Company performed a Step 1 analysis of the reporting unit’s goodwill, intangibles and long-lived assets as of April 2, 2023, and fully impaired the related goodwill, and partially impaired certain tradenames within the reporting unit. The Company concluded that the definite-lived and other long-lived assets of the reporting unit were not impaired.
As part of its annual impairment testing date during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company completed a step 0 analysis of its Consumer Floral & Gifts reporting unit, the only reporting unit with goodwill at the time, and concluded that it was not "more likely than not" that the fair value of its reporting unit was less than its carrying value.

As of its annual impairment testing date during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, the Company completed a step 0 analysis of its Consumer Floral & Gifts and BloomNet reporting units, the only reporting units with goodwill at the time, and concluded that it was not "more likely than not" that the fair values of its reporting units were less than their carrying values.  
During its quarterly assessment in the third quarter of fiscal 2025, the Company concluded that a triggering event had occurred for its Consumer Floral & Gifts reporting unit.  As such, the Company performed a Step 1 analysis of the reporting unit’s goodwill, intangibles and long-lived assets as of March 30, 2025, and partially impaired the related goodwill, and Personalization Mall tradename within the reporting unit. The Company concluded that the definite-lived and other long-lived assets of the reporting unit were not impaired.
As of its annual impairment testing date during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, the Company completed a step 0 analysis of its Consumer Floral & Gifts, BloomNet, and Gourmet Foods & Gift Baskets reporting units and concluded that it was not "more likely than not" that the fair values of its reporting units were less than their carrying values. 
See 
Note 7 – Goodwill and Other Intangibles, Net
 for further information.
Other Intangibles, net
Other intangibles consist of definite-lived intangible assets (such as investment in licenses, customer lists, and others) and indefinite-lived intangible assets (such as acquired tradenames and trademarks). The cost of definite-lived intangible assets is amortized to reflect the pattern of economic benefits consumed, over the estimated periods benefited, ranging from 
3
 to 
16
 years, while indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized.
Definite-lived intangibles are reviewed for impairment whenever changes in circumstances or events may indicate that the carrying amounts are not recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances occur, a recoverability test is performed comparing projected undiscounted cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of an asset or asset group to its carrying value. If the projected undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value, then an impairment charge would be recorded for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value, which is determined by discounting future cash flows.
The Company tests indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually, during the fourth quarter, or whenever changes in circumstances or events may indicate that the carrying amounts are not recoverable. In applying the impairment test, the Company has the option to perform a qualitative test (also known as “Step 0”) or a quantitative test. Under the Step 0 test, the Company assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. Qualitative factors may include, but are not limited to economic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, financial performance, legal and other entity and asset specific events. If, after assessing these qualitative factors, the Company determines it is “more-likely-than-not” that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired, then performing the quantitative test is necessary. The quantitative impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets encompasses calculating a fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset and comparing the fair value to its carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, impairment is recognized for the difference. To determine fair value of other indefinite-lived intangible assets, the Company uses an income approach, the relief-from-royalty method. This method assumes that, in lieu of ownership, a third party would be willing to pay a royalty in order to obtain the rights to use the comparable asset. Other indefinite-lived intangible assets’ fair values require significant judgments in determining both the assets’ estimated cash flows, including the perpetual growth rate, as well as the appropriate discount and royalty rates applied to those cash flows to determine fair value.
As noted in the Goodwill section above, during the third quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company concluded that a triggering event had occurred within its Gourmet Foods & Gift Baskets reporting unit and, as such, performed an impairment test of the indefinite-lived intangibles, which resulted in a partial impairment of certain tradenames within the reporting unit.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company performed a Step 0 analysis and determined that it was not “more likely than not” that the fair values of its indefinite-lived intangibles were less than their carrying amounts.
During its quarterly assessment in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, as a result of a decline in the actual and projected revenue for the Company’s Personalization Mall tradename (an indefinite-lived intangible asset), as well as a higher discount rate resulting from the higher interest rate environment, the Company determined that an impairment assessment was required for this tradename. This assessment resulted in a partial impairment of this tradename. 
F-9
Table of Contents
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, the Company performed a Step 0 analysis for its indefinite-lived intangible assets, excluding its Personalization Mall tradename, and determined that it was not “more likely than not” that the fair values of its indefinite-lived intangibles were less than their carrying amounts. For the Company's Personalization Mall tradename, the Company performed a quantitative test, which determined that the estimated fair value of the Company's intangible asset exceeded its respective carrying amount. 
As noted in the Goodwill section above, during the third quarter of fiscal 2025, the Company concluded that a triggering event had occurred within its Consumer Floral & Gifts reporting unit and, as such, performed an impairment test of the indefinite-lived intangibles, which resulted in a partial impairment of the Personalization Mall tradename within the reporting unit.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, the Company performed a Step 0 analysis for its indefinite-lived intangible assets, and determined that it was not “more likely than not” that the fair values of its indefinite-lived intangibles were less than their carrying amounts. 
See 
Note 7 – Goodwill and Other Intangibles, Net
 for further information.
Business Combinations 
The Company accounts for business combinations in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 805, which requires, among other things, the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize the fair value of all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed; the recognition of acquisition-related costs in the consolidated results of operations; the recognition of restructuring costs in the consolidated results of operations for which the acquirer becomes obligated after the acquisition date; and contingent purchase consideration to be recognized at their fair values on the acquisition date with subsequent adjustments recognized in the consolidated results of operations. The fair values assigned to identifiable intangible assets acquired are determined primarily by using an income approach, which is based on assumptions and estimates made by management. Significant assumptions utilized in the income approach are based on company specific information and projections that are not observable in the market and are therefore considered Level 3 measurements. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the identified assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Operating results of the acquired entity are reflected in the Company’s consolidated financial statements from date of acquisition.
Deferred Catalog Costs
The Company capitalizes the costs of producing and distributing its catalogs and expenses them upon mailing. Included within prepaid and other current assets were $
2.1
 million and $
1.5
 million at June 29, 2025 and June 30, 2024, respectively, relating to prepaid catalog expenses.
Investments
Equity investments without a readily determinable fair value
Investments in non-marketable equity instruments of private companies, where the Company does not possess the ability to exercise significant influence, are accounted for at cost, less impairment (assessed qualitatively at each reporting period), adjusted for observable price changes from orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. These investments are included within “Other assets” in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The aggregate carrying amount of the Company’s cost method investments was
 
$
0.4
 million as of June 29, 2025 and $
2.4
 million as of  June 30, 2024. 
Equity investments with a readily determinable fair value
The Company also holds certain trading securities associated with its Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan (“NQDC Plan”). These investments are measured using quoted market prices at the reporting date and are included within the “Other assets” line item in the consolidated balance sheets (see 
Note 11 - Fair Value Measurements
).

Table of Contents
Concentration of Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. The Company maintains cash and cash equivalents with high quality financial institutions, although bank deposits, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. Concentration of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is limited due to the Company's large number of customers and their dispersion throughout the United States, and the fact that a substantial portion of receivables are related to balances owed by major credit card companies.
 Allowances for credit losses relating to consumer, corporate and franchise accounts receivable (
$
2.4
 million
 at June 29, 2025 and $
2.8
 million at June 30, 2024) have been recorded based upon previous experience and management’s evaluation.
Revenue Recognition
Net revenue is measured based on the amount of consideration that we expect to receive, reduced by discounts and estimates for credits and returns (calculated based upon previous experience and management’s evaluation). Service and outbound shipping charged to customers are recognized at the time the related merchandise revenues are recognized and are included in net revenues. Inbound and outbound shipping and delivery costs are included in cost of revenues. Net revenues exclude sales and other similar taxes collected from customers.
A description of our principal revenue generating activities is as follows:
-
E-commerce revenues - consumer products sold through our online and telephonic channels. Revenue is recognized when control of the merchandise is transferred to the customer, which generally occurs upon shipment. Payment is typically due prior to the date of shipment.
-
Retail revenues - consumer products sold through our retail stores. Revenue is recognized when control of the goods is transferred to the customer at the point of sale, at which time payment is received.
-
Wholesale revenues - products sold to our wholesale customers for subsequent resale. Revenue is recognized when control of the goods is transferred to the customer, in accordance with the terms of the applicable agreement. Payment terms are typically 
30
 days from the date control over the product is transferred to the customer.
-
BloomNet services - membership fees as well as other service offerings to florists. Membership and other subscription-based fees are recognized monthly as earned. Services revenues related to orders sent through the floral network are variable, based on either the number of orders or the value of orders, and are recognized in the period in which the orders are delivered. The contracts within BloomNet services are typically month-to-month and, as a result, no consideration allocation is necessary across multiple reporting periods. Payment is typically due less than 
30
 days from the date the services were performed. 
See 
Note 17 - Business Segments
 for additional information on disaggregated revenue. 
Deferred Revenues
Deferred revenues are recorded when the Company has received consideration (i.e., advance payment) before satisfying its performance obligations. As such, customer orders are recorded as deferred revenue prior to shipment or rendering of product or services. Deferred revenues primarily relate to e-commerce orders placed, but not shipped, prior to the end of the fiscal period, as well as for subscription programs, including our various food, wine, and plant-of-the-month clubs and our Celebrations Passport® program.
Our total deferred revenue, included in "Accrued expenses" on our consolidated balance sheets, as of July 3, 2022, was $
33.7
 million, of which $
33.1
 million was recognized during the year ended July 2, 2023. Our total deferred revenue, as of July 2, 2023, was $
30.8
 million, of which $
30.2
 million was recognized during the year ended June 30, 2024. Our total deferred revenue as of  June 30, 2024 was $
25.0
 million of which, $
24.4
 million was recognized as revenue during the year ended June 29, 2025. The deferred revenue balance as of  June 29, 2025 was $
23.7
 million.
Cost of Revenues
Cost of revenues consists primarily of florist fulfillment costs (fees paid directly to florists), the cost of floral and non-floral merchandise sold from inventory or through third parties, and associated costs, including inbound and outbound shipping charges. Additionally, cost of revenues includes labor and facility costs related to manufacturing and production operations.

Table of Contents
Marketing and Sales
Marketing and sales expense consists primarily of advertising expenses, catalog costs, online portal and search expenses, retail store and fulfillment operations (other than costs included in cost of revenues), and customer service center expenses, as well as the operating expenses of the Company’s departments engaged in marketing, selling and merchandising activities.
The Company expenses all advertising costs, with the exception of catalog costs (see 
Deferred Catalog Costs
 above), at the time the advertisement is first shown.
 Advertising expense (including general advertising, catalog costs, and online portal and search expenses) 
was $
286.4
 million, $
283.6
 million
 and $
291.9
 million for the years ended June 29, 2025, June 30, 2024, and July 2, 2023, respectively.
Technology and Development
Technology and development expense consists primarily of payroll and operating expenses of the Company’s information technology group, costs associated with its websites, including hosting, content development and maintenance and support costs related to the Company’s order entry, customer service, fulfillment and database systems. Costs associated with the acquisition or development of software for internal use are capitalized if the software is expected to have a useful life beyond one year and amortized over the software’s useful life, typically 
three
 to 
five years
. Costs associated with repair maintenance, or the development of website content are expensed as incurred, as the useful lives of such software modifications are less than one year.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company records compensation expense associated with restricted stock awards and other forms of equity compensation based upon the fair value of stock-based awards as measured at the grant date. The cost associated with share-based awards that are subject solely to time-based vesting requirements is recognized over the awards’ service period for the entire award on a straight-line basis. The cost associated with performance-based equity awards is recognized for each tranche over the service period, based on an assessment of the likelihood that the applicable performance goals will be achieved.
Derivatives and Hedging
The Company does not enter into derivative transactions for trading purposes, but rather, on occasion, to manage its exposure to interest rate fluctuations. When entering into these transactions, the Company has periodically managed its floating rate debt using interest rate swaps in order to reduce its exposure to the impact of changing interest rates on its consolidated results of operations and future cash outflows for interest.
 The Company did not have any open derivative positions at June 29, 2025 and June 30, 2024.
Income Taxes
The Company uses the asset and liability method to account for income taxes. The Company has established deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between the financial reporting bases and the income tax bases of its assets and liabilities at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such assets or liabilities are realized or settled. The Company also has net operating loss carryforwards and credit carryforwards in multiple jurisdictions and has recognized deferred assets for those losses and credits.
The Company evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis and establishes valuation allowances when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset may not be realized. In completing this evaluation, the Company considers available positive and negative evidence. Such evidence includes historical operating results, the existence of cumulative earnings and losses in the most recent fiscal years, taxable income in prior carryback year(s) if permitted under the tax law, the time period over which our temporary differences will reverse, the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies, and expectations for future pre-tax operating income. Estimating future taxable income is inherently uncertain and requires judgment. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of this evidence, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods.
F-12
Table of Contents
The Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements on a particular tax position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits (“UTBs”) is adjusted as appropriate for changes in facts and circumstances, such as significant amendments to existing tax law, new regulations or interpretations by the taxing authorities, new information obtained during a tax examination, or resolution of an examination. We recognize both accrued interest and penalties, where appropriate, related to UTBs in income tax expense. Assumptions, judgment and the use of estimates are required in determining if the “more likely than not” standard has been met when developing the provision for income taxes.
 
Net Income (Loss) Per Share
Basic net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing the net income during the period by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per common share is computed by dividing the net income during the period by the sum of the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period and the potential dilutive common shares (consisting of employee stock options and unvested restricted stock awards). Diluted net loss per common share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period and excludes the dilutive potential common shares (consisting of unvested restricted stock awards), as their inclusion would be antidilutive.
 
As a result of the net loss for the years ended
 June 29, 2025, June 30, 2024
, and 
July 2, 2023,
 there is no dilutive impact to the net loss per share calculation.

The amortization of intangible assets for the years ended June 29, 2025, June 30, 2024 and July 2, 2023 was 
$
2.0
 million, $
4.4
 million and $
4.2

During the third quarter of fiscal 2023, due to adverse macroeconomic conditions, a sustained decline in the Company’s market capitalization, and downward adjustments to its business forecast, the Company concluded that a triggering event had occurred that required an interim impairment assessment of the goodwill, intangibles and other long-lived assets of the Gourmet Foods & Gift Baskets reporting unit as of  April 2, 2023.
Based on the impairment assessment performed during the quarter ended April 2, 2023, the Company recorded a non-cash 
goodwill and intangible impairment charge
 against its Gourmet Foods & Gift Baskets reporting unit of $
64.6
 million, comprised of $
62.3
 million, which was attributable to goodwill, and $
2.3
 million, which was attributable to certain tradenames within the same reporting unit. The Company concluded that the definite-lived and other long-lived assets of the reporting unit were not impaired.
As of its annual impairment testing date during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company completed a step 0 analysis of its Consumer Floral & Gifts reporting unit, the only reporting unit with goodwill at that time, and its indefinite-lived intangibles and concluded that it was not “more likely than not” that the fair values were less than their carrying values. 
During its quarterly assessment in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, as a result of a decline in the actual and projected revenue for the Company’s Personalization Mall tradename (an indefinite-lived intangible asset), as well as a higher discount rate resulting from the higher interest rate environment, the Company determined that an impairment assessment was required for this tradename. The Company’s impairment test for its Personalization Mall tradename encompassed calculating the fair value of the asset and comparing that result to its carrying value. To determine fair value the Company used an income approach, the relief-from-royalty method. This method assumes that, in lieu of ownership, a third party would be willing to pay a royalty in order to obtain the rights to use the comparable asset. This assessment resulted in the Company recording a non-cash impairment charge of $
19.8
 million to reduce the recorded carrying value of the Personalization Mall tradename.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, the Company performed a Step 0 analysis for its Consumer Floral & Gifts and BloomNet reporting units, the only reporting units with goodwill, and its indefinite-lived intangible assets, excluding its Personalization Mall tradename, and determined that it was not “more likely than not” that the fair values were less than their carrying amounts. For the Company’s Personalization Mall tradename, the Company performed a quantitative test, which determined that the estimated fair value of the Company's intangible asset exceeded its respective carrying value. 
During the third quarter of fiscal 2025, the Company evaluated whether events or circumstances had changed such that  it was more likely than not that the fair value of its goodwill, intangibles and other long-lived assets were less than their carrying amounts. After consideration of current operating results, changes in macro-economic conditions, and a decline in the Company’s market capitalization, the Company concluded that a triggering event had occurred that required an interim impairment assessment of the goodwill, intangibles and other long-lived assets for its Consumer Floral & Gifts reporting unit as of March 30, 2025.
The Company performed its goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of its Consumer Floral & Gifts reporting unit to its respective carrying value. The Company estimated the fair value of the Consumer Floral & Gifts reporting unit using an equal weighting of the income and market approaches, and a discount rate of 
14.5
%. The Company used industry accepted valuation models and set criteria that were reviewed and approved by various levels of management. Under the income approach, the Company used a discounted cash flow methodology that required management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to forecasted revenues, gross profit margins, operating income margins, working capital cash flow, perpetual growth rates, and long-term discount rates, among others. For the market approach, the Company used the guideline public company method. Under this method, the Company utilized information from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting units, to create valuation multiples that were applied to the operating performance of the reporting unit being tested, in order to obtain their respective fair values. The Company also reconciled the aggregate fair values of its reporting units to its current market capitalization.
The Company’s impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets encompassed calculating a fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset and comparing that result to its carrying value. To determine fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets, the Company used an income approach, the relief-from-royalty method. As discussed above, this method assumes that, in lieu of ownership, a third party would be willing to pay a royalty in order to obtain the rights to use the comparable asset. 
F-17
Table of Contents
The Company’s impairment test for definite-lived and other long-lived assets was performed through a recoverability test, comparing projected undiscounted cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group to its carrying value.
Based on the impairment assessment performed for the period ended March 30, 2025, the Company recorded a non-cash 
goodwill and intangible impairment
 charge of $
138.2
 million, comprised of $
113.4
 million attributable to goodwill and $
24.8
 million attributable to the Personalization Mall tradename within the same reporting unit. The Company concluded that definite-lived and other long-lived assets of the reporting unit were not impaired. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, the Company recorded an immaterial adjustment of $
5.6
 million to increase the previously recognized non-cash goodwill impairment charge. The adjustment was the result of a change in the estimated allocation of the impairment charge between goodwill that is deductible and non-deductible for tax purposes.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025, the Company performed a Step 0 analysis for its goodwill and its indefinite-lived intangible assets, and determined that it was not “more likely than not” that the fair values of its indefinite-lived intangibles were less than their carrying amounts. 
Additional Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Asset Considerations
Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions, estimates, and market factors. Estimating the fair value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets requires the Company to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans, as well as industry, economic, and regulatory conditions. These assumptions and estimates include estimated future annual net cash flows, income tax considerations, discount rates, long-term growth rates, royalty rates, and other market factors. If current expectations of future growth rates and margins are not met, if market factors outside of our control change, such as discount rates, market capitalization, income tax rates, or inflation, or if management’s expectations or plans otherwise change, including updates to our long-term operating plans, then goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets might become impaired in the future.
As described above, goodwill for the Company’s Consumer Floral & Gifts reporting unit and the Company’s Personalization Mall tradename were impaired during the quarter ended March 30, 2025 and were written down to their respective fair values resulting in zero excess fair value over carrying amount as of the impairment test date, resulting in a risk of future impairments if any assumptions (including changes in segments), estimates, or market factors change in the future.
Note 8. 
Leases
The Company currently leases plants, warehouses, offices, store facilities, and equipment under various leases through fiscal 2036. While most lease agreements are of a long-term nature (over a year), the Company also enters into short-term leases, primarily for seasonal needs. Lease agreements  may contain renewal options and rent escalation clauses and require the Company to pay real estate taxes, insurance, common area maintenance and operating expenses applicable to the leased properties. The Company accounts for its leases in accordance with ASC 842.
At contract inception, the Company determines whether a contract is, or contains, a lease by determining whether it conveys the right to control the use of the identified asset for a period of time, by assessing whether the Company has the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of the identified asset and the right to direct the use of the identified asset.
At the lease commencement date, the Company determines if a lease should be classified as an operating or a finance lease (the Company currently has no finance leases) and recognizes a corresponding lease liability and a right-of-use asset on its consolidated balance sheet. The lease liability is initially and subsequently measured as the present value of the remaining fixed minimum rental payments (including base rent and fixed common area maintenance) using discount rates as of the commencement date. Variable payments (including most utilities, real estate taxes, insurance and variable common area maintenance) are expensed as incurred. Further, the Company elected a short-term lease exception policy, permitting it to not apply the recognition requirements of this standard to short-term leases (i.e. leases with terms of 12 months or less) and an accounting policy to account for lease and non-lease components as a single component for certain classes of assets. The right-of-use asset is initially and subsequently measured at the carrying amount of the lease liability adjusted for any prepaid or accrued lease payments, remaining balance of lease incentives received, unamortized initial direct costs, or impairment charges relating to the right-of-use asset. Right-of-use assets are assessed for impairment using the long-lived assets impairment guidance. The discount rate used to determine the present value of lease payments is the Company’s estimated collateralized incremental borrowing rate, based on the yield curve for the respective lease terms, as the Company generally cannot determine the interest rate implicit in the lease.

The Company recognizes expense for its operating leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. As these leases expire, it can be expected that in the normal course of business they will be renewed or replaced. Renewal option periods are included in the measurement of lease liability, where the exercise is reasonably certain to occur. Key estimates and judgments in accounting for leases include how the Company determines: (1) lease payments, (2) lease term, and (3) the discount rate used in calculating the lease liability.

On May 6, 2025 (the “Effective Date”), the Company, certain of its U.S. subsidiaries, the lenders party thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent, entered into a Second Amendment (the “Second Amendment”) to the Third Restated Credit Agreement. The Second Amendment amended the Amended Third Restated Credit Agreement (the Amended Third Restated Credit Agreement, as amended by the Second Amendment, the “Existing Credit Agreement”) by, among other modifications, (i) replacing the financial covenants set forth therein with a minimum liquidity financial covenant until the end of the Company’s fiscal quarter ending December 27, 2026, (ii) decreasing the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and increasing the maximum leverage ratio, in each case, required to be maintained by the Company for the period consisting of the fiscal quarter ending December 27, 2026 through the fiscal quarter ending March 28, 2027 (the period from the Effective Date through March 28, 2027, during which the foregoing modifications are in effect, the “Applicable Period”), (iii) increasing the (x) applicable interest rate margins for SOFR and base rate loans to 
350
 and 
250
 basis points, respectively and (y) the applicable commitment fee in respect of undrawn commitments under the revolving credit facility to 
50
 basis points, in each case, during the period (such period, the “Affected Period”) from the Effective Date until the date the Company has (x) demonstrated compliance with the financial covenants as in effect under the Amended Third Restated Credit Agreement and (y) if applicable, elected to exit the Applicable Period, (iv) decreasing the amount of the commitments in respect of the revolving credit facility to $
205.0
 million, subject to a seasonal reduction to an aggregate amount of $
125.0
 million (or, during the Affected Period, $
50.0
 million) for the period from January 1 to July 1 of each year, and (v) imposing, during the Affected Period, additional conditions to borrowing under the revolving credit facility and additional prepayment obligations with respect to the revolving credit facility and the Term Loan. 
For each borrowing under the Existing Credit Agreement, the Company may elect that such borrowing bear interest at an annual rate equal to either: (1) a base rate plus an applicable margin varying (other than during the Affected Period) based on the Company’s consolidated leverage ratio, where the base rate is the highest of (a) the prime rate, (b) the New York fed bank rate plus 
0.5
%, and (c) an adjusted SOFR rate for a one-month interest period plus 
1
%, or (2) an adjusted SOFR rate plus an applicable margin varying (other than during the Affected Period) based on the Company’s consolidated leverage ratio. The adjusted SOFR rate includes a credit spread adjustment of 
0.1
% for all interest periods. The effective interest rate as of  June 29, 2025 related to the Company's outstanding borrowings was 
7.9
%.
The principal of the Term Loan is payable under the Existing Credit Agreement at a rate of 
$
2.5
 million
 for the first 
7
 quarterly installments beginning on 
September 29, 2023. During the three months ended December 29, 2024, the Company elected to optionally pay down $
25.0
 million against the outstanding Term Loan balance. This payment was applied toward the foregoing installment payments required to be made prior to the Effective Date in direct order of maturity. Pursuant to the Second Amendment, the principal of the Term Loan will be subject 
to a quarterly payment of 
$
3.0
 million, commencing 
on 
September 26, 2025
, 
increasing to a quarterly payment of $
6.0
 million
 for the next 
10
 payments, with the remaining balance of 
$
97.0
 million
 due upon maturity on 
June 27, 2028
. Future principal Term Loan payments under the Credit Agreement are as follows: 
$
21.0
 million
  – 
fiscal 2026
, 
$
24.0
 million
 – 
fiscal 2027
, and 
$
115.0
 million
 – 
fiscal 2028
. 
The Existing Credit Agreement requires that, while any borrowings or commitments are outstanding, the Company comply with certain financial covenants and certain affirmative covenants and negative covenants that, subject to certain exceptions, limit the Company’s ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, make certain investments, make certain restricted payments and, during the Affected Period, hold cash deposits in accounts not maintained with lenders under the Existing Credit Agreement or their affiliates. The Company was in compliance with these covenants as of June 29, 2025. The Existing Credit Agreement is secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company.
Note 11. 
Fair Value Measurements
Cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, prepaids, accounts payable and accrued expenses are reflected in the consolidated balance sheets at carrying value, which approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments. Although no trading market exists, the Company believes that the carrying amount of its debt approximates fair value due to its variable nature (these are level 2 investments). The Company’s investments in non-marketable equity instruments of private companies are carried at cost and are periodically assessed for other-than-temporary impairment, when an event or circumstances indicate that an other-than-temporary decline in value  may have occurred. The Company’s remaining financial assets and liabilities are measured and recorded at fair value (see table below). The Company’s non-financial assets, such as definite lived intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, are recorded at cost and are assessed for impairment when an event or circumstance indicates that an other-than-temporary decline in value  may have occurred. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently, if events occur or circumstances change such that it is more likely than not that an impairment may exist, as required under the accounting standards.
F-21
Table of Contents
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability, in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The authoritative guidance for fair value measurements establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under the guidance are described below:
Level 1
Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity has the ability to access.
Level 2
Valuations based on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
Level 3
Valuations based on inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
The following table presents by level, within the fair value hierarchy, financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis:

At June 29, 2025, the Company had $
22.0
 million of indefinite lived federal net operating losses, $
110.4
 million of state net operating loss carryforwards, some of which will begin to expire in fiscal 2026 to the extent not utilized and $
5.4
 million of foreign net operating loss carryforwards, which will begin to expire in fiscal 2034 if not utilized. At June 29, 2025, the Company’s federal charitable contribution carryforwards were $
21.9
 million, which will begin to expire in fiscal 2027 if not utilized. At June 29, 2025, the Company’s research and development and work opportunity credit carryforwards were $
0.6
 million and $
0.1
 million, respectively, which will both begin to expire in fiscal 2045 if not utilized. 
The Company evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis and establishes valuation allowances when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset may not be realized. In completing this evaluation, the Company considers available positive and negative evidence. Such evidence includes historical operating results, the existence of cumulative earnings and losses in the most recent fiscal years, taxable income in prior carryback year(s) if permitted under the tax law, the time period over which our temporary differences will reverse, the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies, and expectations for future pre-tax operating income. Estimating future taxable income is inherently uncertain and requires judgment. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of this evidence, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods. During fiscal 2025, the Company completed a detailed analysis of future taxable income, focused on the scheduling of temporary differences that are expected to reverse in periods where the Company anticipates taxable income. Due to the goodwill and intangible impairment charge recorded during fiscal 2025, deferred tax liabilities were reduced to an amount whereby the lack of sufficient reversing taxable temporary differences is significant evidence considered by the Company in recording a $
35.9
 million valuation allowance. At the time of the impairment, the Company was in a three-year cumulative loss position and had not identified any tax planning strategies to support the deferred tax asset realizability. Additionally, the impairment charge reduced previously available deferred tax liabilities that had supported the realization of deferred tax assets. During fiscal 2024, the Company recorded valuation allowances of $
1.7
 million relating to certain state and foreign jurisdictions. As of June 30, 2024, the Company had valuation allowances of $
4.9
 million primarily related to certain state and foreign net operating losses.

The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various state jurisdictions, and various foreign countries. Fiscal 2022, fiscal 2023, and fiscal 2024 remain subject to U.S. federal examination. Due to nonconformity with the U.S. federal statute of limitations for assessment, certain states remain open from fiscal 2021. The Company's foreign income tax filings from fiscal 2018 forward are open for examination by its respective foreign tax authorities, mainly Canada and Brazil. The Company is not currently under examination by federal, state or foreign taxing jurisdictions. 
The Company’s policy is to recognize interest and penalties accrued on any unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. At June 29, 2025, the Company has an unrecognized tax benefit, including accrued interest and penalties, included within the “Other liabilities” line item in the consolidated balance sheets, of approximately $
3.4
 million all of which if fully recognized would impact our effective tax rate. The Company believes that $
0.3
 million of the unrecognized tax positions will be resolved over the next twelve months.

The expected volatility of the option is determined using historical volatilities based on historical stock prices. The Company estimated the expected life of options granted based upon the historical weighted average. The risk-free interest rate is determined using the yield available for zero-coupon U.S. government issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the option. The Company has never paid a dividend, and as such the dividend yield is 
0.0
%.

This amount changes based on the fair 
market value of the Company’s stock. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended

Table of Contents
The Company evaluates performance for all of its reportable segments based on contribution margin, which includes only the direct controllable revenue and operating expenses of the segments. This information is used by the Chief Executive Officer to measure segment profitability, allocate resources, and make budgeting and forecasting decisions about the reportable segments. The Chief Executive Officer also uses this measure to monitor trends in year-over-year performance and to compare actual results to the Company's budget and forecasts.
Management’s measure of profitability for these segments does not include the effect of corporate overhead (see (c) below), nor does it include depreciation and amortization, other expense (income), net and income taxes, or stock-based compensation, which are included within corporate overhead. Sales, cost of revenues, and operating expenses are also provided to the Chief Executive Officer. No asset information is provided for the reportable segments as this information is reviewed at the consolidated level by management and not by segment.

Subsequent Events
On July 4, 2025, President Trump signed into law the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (“OBBBA”). The OBBBA makes permanent key elements of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, including 100% bonus depreciation, domestic research cost expensing, and the business interest expense limitation. ASC 740, “Income Taxes”, requires the tax effects of changes in tax rates and tax law to be recognized in the period in which the legislation is enacted. The Company is still evaluating the impact of the OBBBA and the results of such evaluation, if any, will be reflected in the Company’s Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 28, 2025, the period of enactment.
