After \nassessing the totality of events or\n\ncircumstances, if we determine it is\n\nmore likely than not that the\n\nfair value of a reporting\n\nunit \nis less\n\nthan its\n\ncarrying amount,\n\nthen we\n\nperform additional\n\nquantitative tests\n\nto determine\n\nthe magnitude\n\nof any\n\nimpairment. \nDuring\n\nour\n\nannual\n\nimpairment\n\ntest,\n\nwhich\n\nwas\n\nthe\n\nfirst\n\nday\n\nof\n\nthe\n\nfourth\n\nquarter,\n\nwe\n\ndetermined\n\nthat\n\ngoodwill\n\npassed\n\nthe \nqualitative assessment and therefore no quantitative analysis of goodwill impairment was necessary in fiscal 2025. \nThe\n\nCompany\n\nhas\n\ndetermined\n\nthat\n\nall\n\nof\n\nour\n\nlocations\n\nshare\n\nsimilar\n\neconomic\n\ncharacteristics\n\nand\n\nsupport\n\neach\n\nother\n\nin\n\nthe \nproduction of eggs and customer support.\n\nTherefore, we aggregate all our locations\n\nas a single reporting unit for\n\ntesting goodwill \nfor\n\nimpairment.\n\nWhen\n\nthe\n\nCompany\n\nacquires\n\na\n\nnew\n\nlocation,\n\nwe\n\ndetermine\n\nwhether\n\nit\n\nshould\n\nbe\n\nintegrated\n\ninto\n\nour\n\nsingle \nreporting unit\n\nor treated\n\nas a separate\n\nreporting unit.\n\nHistorically, we have concluded\n\nthat acquired\n\noperations should\n\nbe integrated \ninto our single reporting unit due to the\n\noperational changes, redistribution of customers, and significant\n\nchanges in management \nthat occur when we acquire businesses, which result in the acquired operations sharing similar economic characteristics with the \nrest of our locations. Once goodwill associated with acquired operations becomes\n\npart of goodwill of our single reporting unit, it \nno longer represents the particular acquired operations that gave rise to the goodwill. We\n\nmay conclude that a business acquired \nin the future should be treated as a separate reporting unit, in which case it would be tested separately for goodwill impairment. \nJudgment exists in management’s evaluation of the qualitative factors which include macroeconomic conditions, the current egg \nindustry environment, cost\n\ninputs such as\n\nfeed ingredients and\n\noverall financial performance.\n\nFurthermore, judgment exists\n\nin the \nevaluation of\n\nthe threshold\n\nof whether\n\nit is\n\nmore likely\n\nthan not\n\nthat the\n\nfair value\n\nof a\n\nreporting unit\n\nis less\n\nthan its\n\ncarrying \namount. Uncertainty exists due to uncontrollable events that could occur that could negatively affect our operating conditions.\n\n38 \nREVENUE RECOGNITION \nRevenue\n\nrecognition\n\nis\n\ncompleted upon\n\nsatisfaction of\n\nthe\n\nperformance obligation\n\nwhich\n\ngenerally\n\noccurs\n\nupon\n\nshipment\n\nor \ndelivery to a customer based on terms of the sale. \nRevenues are\n\nrecognized in\n\nan amount\n\nthat reflects\n\nthe net\n\nconsideration we\n\nexpect to\n\nreceive in\n\nexchange for\n\ndelivery of\n\nthe \nproducts. The Company periodically\n\noffers sales incentives or other\n\nprograms such as rebates,\n\ndiscounts, coupons, volume-based \nincentives, guaranteed sales\n\nand other programs.\n\nThe Company records\n\nan estimated allowance\n\nfor costs associated\n\nwith these \nprograms, which is recorded\n\nas a reduction in\n\nrevenue at the time\n\nof sale using historical\n\ntrends and projected redemption\n\nrates \nof\n\neach program.\n\nThe Company\n\nregularly reviews\n\nthese estimates\n\nand\n\nany difference\n\nbetween the\n\nestimated costs\n\nand actual \nrealization of these programs would be recognized in the subsequent period. \nAs the estimates\n\nnoted above are\n\nbased on historical\n\ninformation, we do\n\nnot believe that\n\nthere will be\n\na material change\n\nin the \nestimates and assumptions used to recognize revenue. However, if actual results varied significantly from our estimates, it could \nexpose us to material gains or losses.\n\nLOSS CONTINGENCIES \nThe Company evaluates whether a loss contingency exists,\n\nand if the assessment of a\n\ncontingency indicates it is probable that a \nmaterial loss has been\n\nincurred and the amount\n\nof the loss can\n\nbe reasonably estimated, the\n\nestimated loss would be\n\naccrued in \nthe Company’s financial statements. The Company expenses the costs of litigation as they are incurred. \nExcept for\n\nthe $19.6\n\nmillion litigation loss\n\ncontingency accrual in\n\nfiscal 2024,\n\nthere were no\n\nloss contingency accruals\n\nfor the \npast three fiscal years. Our evaluation of whether loss contingencies exist primarily relates to litigation matters. The\n\noutcome of \nlitigation is\n\nuncertain due\n\nto, among\n\nother things,\n\nuncertainties regarding\n\nthe facts\n\nwill be\n\nestablished during\n\nthe proceedings, \nuncertainties regarding\n\nhow the\n\nlaw will\n\nbe applied\n\nto the\n\nfacts established,\n\nand uncertainties\n\nregarding the\n\ncalculation of\n\nany \npotential damages or\n\nthe costs of\n\nany potential injunctive\n\nrelief. If the\n\nfacts discovered or\n\nthe Company’s\n\nassumptions change, \nfuture\n\naccruals\n\nfor\n\nloss\n\ncontingencies\n\nmay\n\nbe\n\nrequired.\n\nResults\n\nof\n\noperations\n\nmay\n\nbe\n\nmaterially\n\naffected\n\nby\n\nlosses\n\nor\n\na\n\nloss \ncontingency accrual resulting from adverse legal proceedings. \nINCOME TAXES \nWe\n\ndetermine our effective tax\n\nrate by estimating our\n\npermanent differences resulting from\n\ndiffering treatment of\n\nitems for tax \nand accounting purposes. Judgment and uncertainty\n\nexist with management’s application of tax regulations\n\nand evaluation of the \nmore-likely-than-not recognition and measurement thresholds. We are periodically audited by taxing authorities. An adverse tax \nsettlement could have a negative impact on our effective tax rate and our results of operations. \n\n39 \nITEM 7A.\n\nQUANTITATIVE\n\nAND QUALITATIVE\n\nDISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKS \n\nCOMMODITY PRICE RISK \nOur primary exposure to\n\nmarket risk arises from\n\nchanges in the prices\n\nof conventional eggs, which\n\nare subject to significant\n\nprice \nfluctuations that are largely beyond our control. We are focused on growing our specialty shell egg business, in part because the \nselling prices of\n\nspecialty shell eggs\n\nare generally not\n\nas volatile as\n\nconventional shell egg\n\nprices. Our exposure to\n\nmarket risk \nalso includes changes in the\n\nprices of corn and soybean\n\nmeal, which are commodities subject\n\nto significant price fluctuations due \nto market conditions that are largely beyond our control. To ensure continued availability of feed ingredients, we may enter\n\ninto \ncontracts for future purchases of\n\ncorn and soybean meal, and\n\nas part of these contracts,\n\nwe may lock-in the basis\n\nportion of our \ngrain purchases several months in advance and commit to purchase organic ingredients to help assure\n\nsupply. Ordinarily,\n\nwe do \nnot enter long-term\n\ncontracts beyond a\n\nyear to purchase\n\ncorn and soybean\n\nmeal or hedge\n\nagainst increases in\n\nthe price of\n\ncorn \nand soybean meal. The following\n\ntable outlines the impact of\n\nprice changes for corn\n\nand soybean meal on feed\n\ncosts per dozen \nas feed ingredient pricing varies: \nChange in price per bushel of corn \n$ \n(0.84) \n$ \n(0.56) \n$ \n(0.28) \n$ \n0.00 \n$ \n0.28 \n$ \n0.56 \n$ \n0.84 \nChange \n\nin price \nper ton \nsoybean \nmeal \n$ \n(76.38) \n0.43 \n0.44 \n0.45 \n0.46 \n0.47 \n0.48 \n0.49 \n$ \n(50.92) \n0.44 \n0.45 \n0.46 \n0.47 \n0.48 \n0.49 \n0.50 \n$ \n(25.46) \n0.45 \n0.46 \n0.47 \n0.48 \n0.49 \n0.50 \n0.51 \n$ \n0.00 \n0.46 \n0.47 \n0.48 \n0.49 \n(a) \n0.50 \n0.51 \n0.52 \n$ \n25.46 \n0.47 \n0.48 \n0.49 \n0.50 \n0.51 \n0.52 \n0.53 \n$ \n50.92 \n0.48 \n0.49 \n0.50 \n0.51 \n0.52 \n0.53 \n0.54 \n$ \n76.38 \n0.49 \n0.50 \n0.51 \n0.52 \n0.53 \n0.54 \n0.55 \n(a)\nBased on 2025 actual costs, table flexes feed cost inputs to show $0.01 impacts to per dozen egg feed production costs. \nINTEREST RATE\n\nRISK \nWe\n\nhave\n\na\n\n$250 million\n\nCredit\n\nFacility,\n\nborrowings\n\nunder\n\nwhich\n\nwould\n\nbear\n\ninterest\n\nat\n\nvariable\n\nrates.\n\nNo\n\namounts\n\nwere \noutstanding under that facility during fiscal\n\n2025 or fiscal 2024.
