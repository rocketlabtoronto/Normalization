Contents\nAmerant Bancorp Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Interim Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)\n\n1.\nBusiness, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\na) Business\nAmerant Bancorp Inc. (the “Company”) is a Florida corporation incorporated in 1985, which has operated since January 1987. The Company is a bank holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (“BHC Act”), as a result of its\n100\n% ownership of Amerant Bank, N.A. (the “Bank”). The Company’s principal office is in the City of Coral Gables, Florida. The Bank is a member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta (“Federal Reserve”) and the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta (“FHLB”). The Bank is a national bank subject to regulation and regular examinations by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”). The Bank has\ntwo\n operating subsidiaries: Amerant Investments, Inc., a securities broker-dealer (“Amerant Investments”) and Amerant Mortgage, LLC (“Amerant Mortgage”), a mortgage lending company domiciled in Florida (“Amerant Mortgage”).\nElant Bank & Trust Ltd., a Grand-Cayman based trust company (the “Cayman Bank”) is a subsidiary of the Bank. The Company is executing a plan for the dissolution of the Cayman Bank and, as of June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the Cayman Bank no longer had any trust relationships, many of which were transferred to the Bank. The dissolution of the Cayman Bank is expected to be completed in 2025, once regulatory approval from the applicable regulatory agency is received.\nIn April 2025, considering its strategic decision to focus on Florida, the Company announced its decision to transition the focus of its mortgage business from being a national mortgage originator to focusing on in-footprint mortgage lending to support the Company’s retail and private banking customer base. Since April 2025 and throughout the early part of the fourth quarter of 2025, the Company plans to progressively reduce the FTE count from\n77\n FTEs to approximately\n20\n, transfer loans owned into our core platform, and exit and/or modify existing vendor contracts.\nSale of Houston Banking Operations\nDuring the second quarter of 2024, the Bank entered into a Purchase and Assumption Agreement with MidFirst Bank (“MidFirst”) pursuant to which MidFirst agreed to purchase certain assets and assume certain liabilities (the “Houston Sale Transaction”) of the banking operations and six branches in the Houston, Texas metropolitan statistical area. In each of the second quarter and first half of 2024, the Company recorded non-routine expenses in connection with the Houston Sale Transaction totaling approximately $\n5.5\n million as follows: (i) $\n3.4\n million in market value adjustments for\ntwo\n branches owned based on third party appraisals; (ii) $\n1.3\n million in loan valuation allowance due to deferred loan costs; (iii) $\n0.5\n million for legal and investment banking fees; and (iv) $\n0.3\n million in intangible write-off. For complete details of the Houston Sale Transaction, see December 31, 2024 Form 10-K for more information.\nSenior Notes\nOn April 1, 2025, the Company redeemed $\n60.0\n million in aggregate principal amount of its\n5.75\n% Senior Notes that were due June 30, 2025 (the “Senior Notes”). The Senior Notes were redeemed in full at a redemption price equal to\n100\n% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The aggregate redemption price, including accrued interest, totaled approximately $\n60.9\n million.\n10\nTable of Contents\nAmerant Bancorp Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Interim Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)\nSegment Information\nDetermination of the CODM\nThe Company’s Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) is its Chief Executive Officer (CEO). The CEO makes the overall decisions about the Company’s resource allocation and assesses the performance of the Company.\nDetermination and Identification of operating segments\nThe CODM manages the Company as\none\n operating segment: the consolidated Company as one entity.  All decisions regarding the allocation of financial, operational, and other resources are managed under this\none\n segment. As part of the determination for the allocation of resources, the CODM regularly reviews net income as the measure of profit or loss. In addition, as part of the CODM’s assessment of the performance of the consolidated entity, the CODM also reviews the consolidated financial statements for significant expenses which include both cash and noncash items, such as amortization and depreciation and stock-based compensation. For more information on the significant components of net income or any significant cash or noncash items, refer to our accompanying consolidated financial statements or the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained within. The measure of assets is reported on the consolidated balance sheet as total consolidated assets.\nSegment results\nAs the Company’s consolidated financial information as of June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024 conform with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP) and the Company is managed on a single operating business segment, we collectively refer to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the Segment Results for the measures of consolidated profit or loss, as well as consolidated total assets.\nStock Repurchase Program\nOn December 19, 2022, the Company announced that the Board of Directors authorized a new repurchase program pursuant to which the Company may purchase, from time to time, up to an aggregate amount of $\n25\n million of its shares of Class A common stock (the “Stock Repurchase Program”). On December 6, 2023, the Board approved to extend the expiration date of the Stock Repurchase Program that was set to expire on December 31, 2023 to December 31, 2024. On December 11, 2024, the Company announced that the Board approved to extend the expiration date to December 31, 2025. As of December 11, 2024, there was approximately $\n12.4\n million available for repurchases under the Stock Repurchase Program. On May 28, 2025, the Company announced that the Board of Directors approved an increase in the amount available for repurchases of the Company’ shares of Class A common stock under the Stock Repurchase Program to $\n25\n million.\nIn the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2025, the Company repurchased an aggregate of\n275,666\n and\n491,093\n shares of Class A common stock at a weighted average price of $\n18.14\n and $\n20.36\n per share, under the Stock Repurchase Program. The aggregate purchase price for these transactions was $\n5.0\n million and $\n10.0\n million in the three and six months ended June 30, 2025, including transaction costs. In each of the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2024, the Company repurchased an aggregate of\n200,652\n shares of Class A common stock at a weighted average price of $\n22.17\n per share. The aggregate purchase price for these transactions was $\n4.4\n million, including transaction costs.\n11\nTable of Contents\nAmerant Bancorp Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Interim Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)\nIn the three and six months ended June 30, 2025, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the cancellation of all shares of Class A common stock previously repurchased. As of June 30, 2025 and 2024, there were\nno\n shares of Class A common stock held as treasury stock.\nDividends\nSet forth below are the details of dividends declared and paid by the Company in the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2025 and 2024:\nDeclaration Date\nRecord Date\nPayment Date\nDividend Per Share\nDividend Amount\n04/23/2025\n05/15/2025\n05/30/2025\n$\n0.09\n$\n3.8\n million\n01/22/2025\n02/14/2025\n02/28/2025\n$\n0.09\n$\n3.8\n million\n04/24/2024\n05/15/2024\n05/30/2024\n$\n0.09\n$\n3.0\n million\n01/17/2024\n02/14/2024\n02/29/2024\n$\n0.09\n$\n3.0\n million\nOn July 23, 2025, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $\n0.09\n per share of the Company’s common stock. The dividend is payable on August 29, 2025, to shareholders of record at the close of business on August 15, 2025.\n12\nTable of Contents\nAmerant Bancorp Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Interim Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)\nb) Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nSignificant Accounting Policies\n\n The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required for a fair statement of financial position, results of operations and cash flows in conformity with GAAP. These unaudited interim consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim periods presented. These adjustments are of a normal, recurring nature. Interim period operating results may not be indicative of the operating results for a full year or any other period. These unaudited interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 and for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024 and the accompanying footnote disclosures for the Company, which are included in the 2024 Form 10-K.\nIn the second quarter of 2025, the Company changed its policy for charging off unsecured consumer loans when balances are past-due 120 days or more. Previously, the Company charged-off these loan types when balances were 90 days past due. The Company believes this change is in line with regulatory guidance. There was no material impact to Company’s consolidated financial statements as of and for the six months ended ended June 30, 2025 as a result of this change in policy.\nFor a complete summary of our significant accounting policies,\nsee\n Note 1 to the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements in the 2024 Form 10-K.\nEstimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Significant estimates made by management include: (i) the determination of the allowance for credit losses; (ii) the fair values of loans, securities and derivative contracts; (iii) the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance; and (iv) the determination of whether the amount of deferred tax assets will more likely than not be realized. Management believes that these estimates are appropriate. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\n\nc)\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nIssued and Not Yet Adopted\nThe  Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”)  2024-03 and 2025-01 Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income—Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses, and Clarifying the Effective Date. This new guidance is intended to improve the disclosures a public company makes with respect to its expenses and seeks to address requests from financial statement users for more detailed information about the types of expenses in common captions. This new guidance is effective for public business entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements when adopted.\nFor a description of other recently issued accounting pronouncements,\nsee\n Note 1 to the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements in the 2024 Form 10-K.\n13\nTable of Contents\nAmerant Bancorp Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Interim Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)\nd)\nSubsequent Events\nOn July 4, 2025, federal legislation generally referred to as H.R. 1 - One Big Beautiful Bill Act (the “Act”) was signed into law. The Act includes a variety of tax provisions including permanently extending and modifying certain key aspects of existing tax law.\n\nU.S. GAAP requires the effects of changes in tax laws and rates to be recognized in its financial statements in the period in which legislation is enacted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the Act on its consolidated financial statements; however, the Company does not anticipate a material impact resulting from the Act.\nThe effects of other significant subsequent events, if any, have been recognized or disclosed in these unaudited interim consolidated financial statements.\n2.\n\nInterest Earning Deposits with Banks, Other Short-Term Investments and Restricted Cash\nAt June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, interest earning deposits with banks are mainly comprised of deposits with the Federal Reserve and other U.S. banks of approximately $\n573\n million and $\n520\n million, respectively. At June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the average interest rate on these deposits was approximately\n4.44\n%  and\n5.31\n%, respectively. These deposits have no stated maturity dates.\nAs of June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the Company held US Treasury Bills classified as part of other short-term investments in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. At June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the Company held $\n7.1\n million and $\n6.9\n million, respectively, with an average yield of\n4.23\n% and\n5.07\n%, respectively, related to these investments. These other short-term investments have a stated maturity of 90 days or less and as such are deemed cash and cash equivalents.\nAt June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the Company had restricted cash balances of $\n8.0\n million and $\n24.4\n million, respectively. These balances include cash pledged as collateral, by other banks to us, to secure derivatives’ margin calls. This cash pledged as collateral also represents an obligation, by the Bank, to repay according to margin requirements. At June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, this obligation was $\n6.3\n million  and $\n23.5\n million, respectively, which is included as part of other liabilities in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. In addition, we have cash balances pledged as collateral to secure the issuance of letters of credit by other banks on behalf of our customers.\n14\nTable of Contents\nAmerant Bancorp Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Interim Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)\n3.\n\nSecurities\n        a) Debt Securities\nDebt securities available for sale\nThe Company’s investments in debt securities primarily consist of mortgage-backed securities (“MBS”).\nThe following tables present granular information such as amortized cost, allowance for credit losses and approximate fair values of all debt securities available for sale:\nJune 30, 2025\nAmortized\nCost\nGross Unrealized\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nEstimated\nFair Value\n(in thousands)\nGains\nLosses\nU.S. Treasury Securities\n$\n1,972\n\n$\n—\n\n$\n—\n\n$\n—\n\n$\n1,972\n\nU.S. Government agency and sponsored enterprise residential MBS\n1,646,816\n\n3,204\n\n(\n34,267\n)\n—\n\n1,615,753\n\nU.S. Government agency and sponsored enterprise commercial MBS\n146,682\n\n514\n\n(\n3,904\n)\n—\n\n143,292\n\nU.S. Government agency and sponsored enterprise obligations\n14,393\n\n7\n\n(\n277\n)\n—\n\n14,123\n\nNon-agency commercial MBS (1)\n12,500\n\n—\n\n(\n463\n)\n—\n\n12,037\n\nMunicipal Bonds (2)\n1,732\n\n—\n\n(\n201\n)\n—\n\n1,531\n\nTotal debt securities available for sale (3)\n$\n1,824,095\n\n$\n3,725\n\n$\n(\n39,112\n)\n$\n—\n\n$\n1,788,708\n\n__________________\n(1)\nIssued by a financial institution.\n(2)\nIncludes MBS securities with a fair value of $\n1.5\n million and amortized cost of $\n1.7\n million.\n(3)\nExcludes accrued interest receivable of $\n6.7\n million as of June 30, 2025, which is included as part of accrued interest receivable and other assets in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet.

The Company evaluates these securities for credit losses by reviewing current market conditions, the extent and nature of changes in fair value, credit ratings, default and delinquency rates and current analysts’ evaluations. The Company believes the decline in fair value on these debt securities below their amortized cost basis is attributable to changes in interest rates and investment securities markets, generally, and not credit quality. As a result, the Company did\nno\nt record an Allowance for Credit Losses, or ACL, on these securities as of June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024.

The ACL was determined using a weighted-average of various economic scenarios provided by a third-party and incorporated qualitative components. There have not been material changes in our policies and methodology to estimate the ACL in the six months ended June 30, 2025.\nThe ACL increased by $\n1.6\n million, or\n1.8\n% at June 30, 2025, compared to December 31, 2024. The ACL as a percentage of total loans held for investment was\n1.20\n% at June 30, 2025 compared to\n1.18\n% at December 31, 2024. The increase in the ACL during the period included a provision for credit losses on loans in the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2025, which was partially offset by net charge-offs.\n25\nTable of Contents\nAmerant Bancorp Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Interim Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)\nIn the second quarter of 2025, the provision for credit losses on loans included $\n6.0\n million to cover for charge-offs, and $\n2.2\n million due to macro-economic factors. This was partially offset by releases of $\n1.5\n million due to lower loan balances and $\n3.3\n million due to recoveries.\nIn the first half of 2025, the provision for credit losses on loans included $\n14.1\n million for specific reserves, $\n10.0\n million to cover net charge-offs, and $\n4.7\n million due to model adjustments for macroeconomic factors, partially offset by releases of $\n1.1\n million due to credit quality and other macroeconomic updates, $\n2.3\n million due to lower loan balances and $\n4.8\n million due to recoveries.\nIn the second quarter of 2025, the Company sold a participation in a Quick Service Restaurant (“QSR”)-related loan with carrying value of $\n6.9\n million and ACL of $\n4.8\n million as of March 31, 2025.

Typically, one type of concession, such as a term extension, is granted initially. If the borrower continues to experience financial difficulty, another concession, such as principal forgiveness, may be granted.\nThe Company had\nno\n new loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty during the three  and six month periods ended June 30, 2025 and 2024. There were\nno\n modified loans that defaulted in the three and six months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024 and had been modified within the 12 months preceding the payment default.\nAs of June 30, 2025, there were\nno\n outstanding balances related to loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties compared to $\n9.4\n million as of December 31, 2024. The $\n9.4\n million as of December 31, 2024 was related to one commercial nonaccrual loan that was paid off in the second quarter of 2025.\nCredit Risk Quality\nThe sufficiency of the ACL is reviewed at least quarterly by the Chief Risk Officer and the Chief Financial Officer. The Board of Directors considers the ACL as part of its review of the Company’s consolidated financial statements. As of June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the Company believes the ACL to be sufficient to absorb expected credit losses in the loans portfolio in accordance with GAAP.\nLoans may be classified but not considered collateral dependent due to one of the following reasons: (1) the Company has established minimum dollar amount thresholds for individual assessment of expected credit losses, which results in loans under those thresholds being excluded from individual assessment of expected credit losses; and (2) classified loans may be considered in the assessment because the Company expects to collect all amounts due.\nAs part of the on-going monitoring of the credit quality of the Company’s loan portfolio, management tracks certain credit quality indicators including trends related primarily to (i) the risk rating of loans, (ii) the loan payment status, (iii) net charge-offs, (iv) nonperforming loans and (v) the general economic conditions in the main geographies where the Company’s borrowers conduct their businesses. The Company considers the views of its regulators as to loan classification and in the process of estimating expected credit losses.\nThe Company utilizes an internal risk rating system to identify the risk characteristics of each of its loans, or group of homogeneous loans such as consumer loans. Internal risk ratings are updated on a continuous basis on a scale from 1 (worst credit quality) to 10 (best credit quality). Loans are then grouped in five master risk categories for purposes of monitoring rising levels of potential loss risks and to enable the activation of collection or recovery processes as defined in the Company’s Credit Risk Policy.\nInternal risk ratings are considered the most meaningful indicator of credit quality for commercial loans.\nGenerally, internal risk ratings for commercial real estate loans and commercial loans with balances over $\n3\n million are updated at least annually and more frequently if circumstances indicate that a change in risk rating may be warranted. For consumer loans, single-family residential loans and smaller commercial loans under $\n3\n million, risk ratings are updated based on the loans past due status.\nThe following is a summary of the master risk categories and their associated loan risk ratings, as well as a description of the general characteristics of the master risk category:\n27\nTable of Contents\nAmerant Bancorp Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Interim Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)\nLoan Risk Rating\nMaster risk category\nNonclassified\n4\n to\n10\nClassified\n1\n to\n3\nSubstandard\n3\nDoubtful\n2\nLoss\n1\n28\nTable of Contents\nAmerant Bancorp Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Interim Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)\nN\nonclassified\nThis category includes loans considered as Pass (5-10) and Special Mention (4). A loan classified as Pass is considered of sufficient quality to preclude a lower adverse rating. These loans are generally well protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the borrower or by the value of any collateral received. Special Mention loans are defined as having potential weaknesses that deserve management’s close attention which, if left uncorrected, could potentially result in further credit deterioration. Special Mention loans may include loans originated with certain credit weaknesses or that developed those weaknesses since their origination.\nClassified\nThis classification indicates the presence of credit weaknesses which could make loan repayment unlikely, such as partial or total late payments and other contractual defaults.\nSubstandard\nA loan classified substandard is inadequately protected by the sound worth and paying capacity of the borrower or the collateral pledged. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if the credit weaknesses are not corrected. Loss potential, while existing in the aggregate amount of substandard loans, does not have to exist in individual assets.\nDoubtful\nThese loans have all the weaknesses inherent in a loan classified as substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. These are poor quality loans in which neither the collateral, if any, nor the financial condition of the borrower presently ensure collection in full in a reasonable period of time. As a result, the possibility of loss is extremely high.\n\nLoss\nLoans classified as loss are considered uncollectible and of such little value that the continuance as bankable assets is not warranted. This classification does not mean that the assets have absolutely no recovery or salvage value, but not to the point where a write-off should be deferred even though partial recoveries may occur in the future. This classification is based upon current facts, not probabilities. As a result, loans in this category should be promptly charged off in the period in which they are determined to be uncollectible.\n29\nTable of Contents\nAmerant Bancorp Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes

For collateral-dependent loans where the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and the Company expects repayment of the financial asset to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral, the ACL is measured based on the difference between the fair value of the collateral and the amortized cost basis of the loan as of the measurement date. When repayment is expected to be from the operation of the collateral, expected credit losses are calculated as the amount by which the amortized cost basis of the loan exceeds the present value of expected cash flows from the operation of the collateral. When repayment is expected to be from the sale of the collateral, expected credit losses are calculated as the amount by which the amortized cost basis of the loan exceeds the fair value of the underlying collateral less estimated costs to sell. The ACL may be zero if the fair value of the collateral at the measurement date exceeds the amortized cost basis of the loan.\nOther Individually Evaluated Loans\nAs of June 30, 2025, as part of the process of calculating the ACL, in addition to collateral dependent loans, the Company evaluated individually $\n53.2\n million in commercial loans primarily in the restaurant, transportation and healthcare industries, in addition to collateral dependent loans ($\n7.2\n million in a commercial loan in the restaurant industry as of December 31, 2024). The ACL on these loans as of June 30, 2025 was $\n4.7\n million ($\n2.5\n million as of December 31, 2024).\n\n6.\nTime Deposits\nTime deposits in denominations of $100,000 or more amounted to approximately $\n1.3\n billion at June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively.

These interest rate swaps are designed as cash flow hedges to manage the exposure that arises from differences in the amount of the Company’s known or expected cash receipts and the known or expected cash payments on designated debt instruments. These interest rate swap contracts involve the Company’s payment of fixed-rate amounts in exchange for the Company receiving variable-rate payments over the life of the contracts without exchange of the underlying notional amount.\n\nAt June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the Company had\nfive\n interest rate swap contracts with notional amounts totaling $\n64.2\n million maturing in the third and fourth quarters of 2025. These contracts were designated as cash flow hedges to manage the exposure of variable rate interest payments on all of the Company’s outstanding variable-rate junior subordinated debentures with principal amounts at June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024 totaling $\n64.2\n million. The Company expects these interest rate swaps to be highly effective in offsetting the effects of changes in interest rates on cash flows associated with the Company’s variable-rate junior subordinated debentures. The Company recognized unrealized gains of $\n0.1\n million and $\n0.2\n million in the three months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, and unrealized gains of $\n0.1\n million and $\n0.4\n million in the six months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, in connection with these interest rate swap contracts, which were included as part of interest expense on junior subordinated debentures in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income.\nIn 2019, the Company terminated\n16\n interest rate swaps that had been designated as cash flow hedges of variable rate interest payments on the outstanding and expected rollover of variable-rate advances from the FHLB. The Company is recognizing the contracts’ cumulative net unrealized gains of $\n8.9\n million in earnings over the remaining original life of the terminated interest rate swaps ranging between\none month\n and\nseven years\n. The Company recognizes a reduction of interest expense on FHLB advances as a result of this amortization.\nInterest Rate Swaps On Loans\nAs of June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the Company had\none\n interest rate swap contract with a notional amount of $\n50.0\n million. In the second quarter of 2025, this contract matured and was renewed for another 2 years.  The Company designates this interest rate swap contract as a cash flow hedge to manage interest rate risk exposure on variable rate interest receipts on the first $\n50\n million principal balance of a pool of loans. This interest rate swap contract involves the Company’s payment of variable-rate amounts in exchange for the Company receiving fixed-rate payments over the life of the contract without exchange of the underlying notional amount. Unrealized losses on these instruments are included as part of interest income on loans in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income.\n40\nTable of Contents\nAmerant Bancorp Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Interim Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)\nDerivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments\n  a) Customer related positions\nThe Company offers certain derivatives products, including interest rate swaps and caps, directly to qualified commercial banking customers to facilitate their risk management strategies. The Company partially offsets its exposure to interest rate swaps and caps by entering similar derivative contracts with various third-party brokers.\n Interest Rate Swaps\nInterest rate swap contracts involve the Company’s payment of variable-rate amounts to customers in exchange for the Company receiving fixed-rate payments from customers over the life of the contracts without exchange of the underlying notional amount.\n The Company enters into swap participation agreements with other financial institutions to manage the credit risk exposure on certain interest rate swaps with customers. Under these agreements, the Company, as the beneficiary or guarantor, will receive or make payments from/to the counterparty if the borrower defaults on the related interest rate swap contract. The notional amount of these agreements is based on the Company’s pro-rata share of the related interest rate swap contracts.\nInterest Rate Caps\nInterest rate cap contracts involve the Company making payments if an interest rate exceeds the agreed strike price.\nb) Economic Hedges\nThe Company enters into forward sale contracts  to effectively offset changes in market valuation on the trading securities portfolio. These forward sale contracts are the commitment to sell To-Be-Announced (“TBA”) mortgage-backed securities on a specific future date. At December 31, 2024, there were\nno\n derivatives classified as economic hedges. In each of the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2025, the net unrealized loss on these instruments was $\n1.9\n million. This  amount was included in derivative losses, net in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income.\nc) Mortgage Derivatives\nThe Company enters into interest rate lock commitments and forward sale contracts to manage the risk exposure in the mortgage banking area. Interest rate lock commitments guarantee the funding of residential mortgage loans originated for sale, at specified interest rates and times in the future. Forward sale contracts consist of commitments to deliver mortgage loans, originated and/or purchased, in the secondary market at a future date. A separate type of forward sale contracts are the commitment to sell To-Be-Announced (“TBA”) mortgage-backed securities on a specific future date.

The average balance of total loans held for sale was $53.6 million and $191.7 million in the three months ended June 30, 2025 and June 30, 2024, respectively, and $49.9 million and $90.0 million in the six months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.\n(2)    Includes average non-performing loans of $97.6 million and $52.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2025 and June 30, 2024, respectively, and $100.6 million and $42.7 million in the six months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.\n(3)    Includes the average balance of net unrealized gains and losses in the fair value of debt securities available for sale. The average balance includes average net unrealized losses of $43.5 million and $115.8 million in the three months ended June 30, 2025 and June 30, 2024, respectively, and $45.2 million and $108.6 million in the  six months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.\n(4)    Includes nontaxable securities with average balances of $53.9 million and $18.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2025 and June 30, 2024, respectively, and $54.6 million and $18.8 million in the  six months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The tax equivalent yield for these nontaxable securities was 4.81%, and 4.47% for the three months ended June 30, 2025 and June 30, 2024,  respectively, and 4.75% and 4.51% for the six months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. In 2025 and 2024, the tax equivalent yields were calculated assuming a 21% tax rate and dividing the actual yield by 0.79.\n(5)    We had no average held to maturity balances in the three and six months ended June 30, 2025. Includes nontaxable securities with average balances of $47.8 million and $48.1 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively. The tax equivalent yield for these nontaxable securities were 4.23% and 4.24%\n\nfor the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively.

Cost of total deposits: calculated based upon the average balance of total noninterest.bearing and interest bearing deposits, which includes time deposits.financial assets which yield interest or similar income.\n71\n\nNet Interest Income\nThree Months Ended June 30, 2025 and 2024\nNet interest income in the three months ended June 30, 2025, was $90.5 million, an increase of $11.1 million, or 14.0%, from $79.4 million in the three months ended June 30, 2024. This was primarily driven by: (i) lower cost of interest bearing liabilities which decreased by 45 basis points in the second quarter of 2025 compared to the same period one year ago, (ii) increases of $501.6 million, or 39.6%, $69.0 million or 1.0%,  and $150.0 million or 41.2%, in the average balances of debt securities available for sale, the loan portfolio, and deposits with banks, respectively, during the period.\nThese improvements were partially offset by (i) a 21 basis points decrease in the average yield on total interest earning assets, mainly loans and deposits with banks,  and (ii) an increase of $188.2 million or 2.6%, in the average balance of total interest-bearing liabilities in the second quarter compared to the same period last year, mainly driven by a higher average balance in money market deposit accounts; and (iii) a decrease of $221.1 million, or 100.0%, in the average balance of debt securities held to maturity. Net interest margin was 3.81%  in the three months ended June 30, 2025, an increase of 25 basis points from 3.56% in the three months ended June 30, 2024.\nSee\n discussions further below for more details.\nDuring the second quarter of 2025 we had higher average balance of debt securities available for sale compared to the same period last year. In addition, we had no debt securities held to maturity at June 30, 2025, compared to $219.6 million at June 30, 2024. The Company was able to reprice the cost of its interest-bearing deposits to offset lower yields on the loan portfolio we recorded during the second quarter of 2025 compared to the same period last year.  Additionally, we continued investing in higher-yielding, fixed rate, debt securities available for sale, and maintaining a high average balance in funds at the Federal Reserve.\nSee\n discussions further below for more details.\nInterest Income\nTotal interest income was $151.1 million in the three months ended June 30, 2025, an increase of $4.7 million, or 3.2%, compared to $146.4 million for the same period of 2024. This was primarily driven by an increase of $501.6 million, or 39.6%,  and $150.0 million or 41.2%, in the average balances of debt securities available for sale and deposits with banks, respectively, during the period. These increases were partially offset by: (i) a decrease of $221.1 million, or 100.0%, in the average balance of debt securities held to maturity and (ii) an 21 basis points decrease in the average yield on total interest earning assets, mainly loans and deposits with banks.\nInterest income on loans in the three months ended June 30, 2025 was $122.2 million, a decrease of $2.0 million, or 1.6%, compared to $124.1 million in the same period last year, primarily due to a 20 basis points decrease in average yields. The decrease in interest income on loans was partially offset by an increase in the average balance of loans which include increases in commercial loans during the quarter compared to the same period in 2024.\nSee\n “-Average Balance Sheet, Interest and Yield/Rate Analysis” for detailed information.\nInterest income on debt securities available for sale was $21.9 million in the three months ended June 30, 2025, an increase of $7.8 million, or 55.5%, compared to $14.1 million in the same period of 2024. This was mainly due to an increase of $501.6 million, or 39.6% in the average balance of these securities as well as an increase of 50 basis points in average yields, primarily as a result of the investment portfolio repositioning that was completed in October 2024. In the three months ended June 30, 2025, the average balance of accumulated net unrealized loss included in the carrying value of these securities was $43.5 million compared to $115.8 million in the same period last year.\n72\n\nAs of June 30, 2025, floating rate investments represent 19% of our total investment portfolio compared to 12.9% at June 30, 2024. In addition, the expected overall duration decreased to 4.4 years at June 30, 2025 from 5.3 years at June 30, 2024  due to higher estimated prepayment assumptions and investment portfolio mix of larger proportion of floating rate securities that have a lower duration versus fixed rate securities.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense was $60.6 million in the three months ended June 30, 2025, a decrease of $6.4 million or 9.6%, compared to $67.1 million in the same period of 2024. This was primarily due to a decrease of 45 basis points in average rates on total interest-bearing liabilities, mainly due to a decrease of 52 basis points in the average rates paid on total deposits, and the redemption of Senior Notes in the second quarter of 2025.These decreases were partially offset by higher average balance of total deposits, mainly money market deposit accounts.\n Interest expense on interest-bearing deposits was $51.9 million in the three months ended June 30, 2025, a decrease of $5.9 million, or 10.2%, compared to $57.7 million for the same period of 2024. This was mainly driven by a decrease of 52 basis points in the average rates paid on total deposits, partially offset by an increase of $268.1 million, or 4.2%, in their average balance.\nSee\n below for a detailed explanation of changes by major deposit category:\n•\nTime deposit\ns. Interest expense on total time deposits decreased $3.7 million, or 14.2%, in the three months ended June 30, 2025 compared to the same period in 2024. This was mainly due to a decrease of 46 basis points in the average cost of total time deposits. In addition, there was a decrease of $109.1 million, or 4.8%, in the average balance of these deposits, which includes a decrease of $80.7 million in the average balance of customer CDs and a decrease of $28.5 million in the average balance of brokered time deposits.\n•\nInterest bearing checking and savings accounts\n. Interest expense on checking and savings accounts decreased $2.2 million, or 6.9% in the three months ended June 30, 2025 compared to the same period one year ago. This was mainly due to a decrease of 47 basis points in the average costs on these deposits coupled with decreases of $119.9 million, or 5.0%, and $16.7 million, or 6.6%, in the average balances of interest bearing demand deposits and savings accounts, respectively. This was partially offset by an increase of $513.7 million, or 36.4%, in the average balance of money market deposit accounts in the three months ended June 30, 2025 compared to the same period in 2024.\nInterest expense on advances from the FHLB increased $0.3 million, or 4.1%, in the three months ended June 30, 2025 compared to the same period of 2024, primarily driven by an increase of 25 basis points in average rates paid. In the first six months of 2025, the Company borrowed $50.0 million and repaid $30.0 million of advances from the FHLB.\nSee\n “Capital Resources and Liquidity Management” for more details on the repayment of advances from the FHLB.\nSix Months Ended June 30, 2025 and 2024\nNet interest income in the six months ended June 30, 2025, was $176.4 million, an increase of $19.1 million, or 12.1%, from $157.3 million in the six months ended June 30, 2024. This was primarily driven by an increase of $368.3 million, or 29.4%, $128.0 million or 1.8%, and $153.6 million or 39.0%, in the average balances of debt securities available for sale, the loan portfolio, and deposits with banks, respectively, during the period. Additionally, the cost of interest-bearing liabilities decreased 40 basis points in the current year compared to the same period last year. These improvements were partially offset by (i) a decrease of $223.0 million, or 100.0%, in the average balance of debt securities held to maturity; (ii) a 17 basis points decrease in the average yield on total interest earning assets; and (ii) an increase of $124.8 million or 1.7%, in the average balance of total interest-bearing liabilities in the current year compared to the same period last year . Net interest margin was 3.78%  in the six months ended June 30, 2025, an increase of 24 basis points from 3.54% in the six months ended June 30, 2024.\nSee\n discussions further below for more details.\n73\n\nDuring the six months ended June 30, 2025, we had higher average balance of loans and debt securities available for sale compared to the same period last year. In addition, we had no debt securities held to maturity at June 30, 2025, compared to $219.6 million at June 30, 2024. The Company was able to reprice the cost of its interest-bearing deposits to offset lower yields on the loan portfolio we recorded during the first half of 2025 compared to the same period last year. Additionally, we continued investing in higher-yielding, fixed rate, debt securities available for sale, and maintaining a high average balance in funds at the Federal Reserve.\nSee\n discussions further below for more details.\nInterest Income\nTotal interest income was $297.5 million in the six months ended June 30, 2025, an increase of $6.5 million, or 2.2%, compared to $291.0 million for the same period of 2024. This was primarily driven by an increase of $368.3 million, or 29.4%, $128.0 million, or 1.8%, and  $153.6 million or 39.0%,  in the average balances of debt securities available for sale, the loan portfolio, and deposits with banks, respectively, during the period. These increases were partially offset by: (i) a 17 basis points decrease in the average yield on total interest earning assets, and (ii) a decrease of $223.0 million, or 100.0%, in the average balance of debt securities held to maturity.\nInterest income on loans in the six months ended June 30, 2025 was $243.2 million, a decrease of $3.6 million, or 1.5%, compared to $246.8 million in the same period last year, primarily due to a 21 basis points decrease in average yields. The decrease in interest income on loans was partially offset by an increase in the average balance of loans which include increases in commercial loans during the year compared to the same period 2024.\nSee\n “-Average Balance Sheet, Interest and Yield/Rate Analysis” for detailed information.\nInterest income on debt securities available for sale was $39.9 million in the six months ended June 30, 2025, an increase of $12.6 million, or 46.2%, compared to $27.3 million in the same period of 2024. This was mainly due to an increase of $368.3 million, or 29.4% in the average balance of these securities as well as an increase of 58 basis points in average yields, primarily as a result of the investment portfolio repositioning that was completed in October 2024. In the six months ended June 30, 2025, the average balance of accumulated net unrealized losses included in the carrying value of these securities was $45.2 million compared to $108.6 million in the same period last year. As of June 30, 2025, corporate debt securities comprised 0.8% of the available-for-sale portfolio, down from 20.7% at June 30, 2024.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense was $121.1 million in the six months ended June 30, 2025, a decrease of $12.6 million or 9.42%, compared to $133.7 million in the same period of 2024. This was primarily due to a decrease of 40 basis points in the average rates paid on total interest-bearing liabilities. These decreases were partially offset by a higher average balance of total deposits mainly in money market accounts.\n  Interest expense on interest-bearing deposits was $102.9 million in the six months ended June 30, 2025, a decrease of $13.6 million, or 11.68%, compared to $116.5 million for the same period of 2024. This was mainly driven by a decrease of 48 basis points in the average rates paid on total deposits. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $125.2 million, or 2.0%, in their average balance.\nSee\n below for a detailed explanation of changes by major deposit category:\n•\nTime deposit\ns. Interest expense on total time deposits decreased $6.0 million, or 11.4%, in the six months ended June 30, 2025 compared to the same period in 2024. This was mainly due to a decrease of 36 basis points in the average cost of total time deposits. In addition, there was a decrease of $86.1 million, or 3.8%, in the average balance of these deposits, which includes a decrease of $61.9 million in the average balance of customer CDs and a decrease of  $24.2 million in the average balance of brokered time deposits.\n74\n\n•\nInterest bearing checking and savings accounts\n. Interest expense on checking and savings accounts decreased $7.6 million, or 11.9% in the six months ended June 30, 2025 compared to the same period one year ago, mainly due to a decrease of 50 basis points in the average costs on these deposits. In addition, there was a decrease of $215.3 million, or 8.9%, and $19.7 million, or 7.6%, in the average balances of interest bearing demand deposits and savings accounts, respectively. The decreases in interest bearing demand deposits and savings accounts were partially offset by an increase of $446.3 million, or 31.4%, in the average balance of money market accounts in the six months ended June 30, 2025 compared to the same period in 2024.\nInterest expense on advances from the FHLB increased $1.9 million, or 15.2%, in the six months ended June 30, 2025 compared to the same period of 2024, primarily driven by an increase of 40 basis points in average rates paid.\nAnalysis of the Allowance for Credit Losses\nSet forth in the table below are the changes in the allowance for credit losses for each of the periods presented.\nThree Months Ended June 30,\nSix Months Ended June 30,\n(in thousands)\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nBalance at the beginning of the period\n$\n98,266\n$\n96,050\n$\n84,963\n$\n95,504\nCharge-offs\nReal estate loans\nCommercial Real Estate (CRE)\nMulti-family residential\n—\n—\n—\n(591)\nSingle-family residential\n(156)\n—\n(216)\n—\nOwner occupied\n—\n—\n(130)\n—\n(156)\n—\n(346)\n(591)\nCommercial\n(16,624)\n(13,452)\n(18,327)\n(15,876)\nConsumer and others\n(1,799)\n(6,762)\n(5,286)\n(16,949)\nTotal Charge-offs\n$\n(18,579)\n$\n(20,214)\n$\n(23,959)\n$\n(33,416)\nRecoveries\nReal estate loans\nCommercial Real Estate (CRE)\nNon-Owner occupied\n$\n—\n$\n—\n$\n—\n$\n—\nLand development and construction loans\n—\n11\n18\n36\n—\n11\n18\n36\nSingle-family residential\n—\n8\n—\n26\nOwner occupied\n40\n—\n40\n17\n40\n19\n58\n79\nCommercial\n2,732\n400\n3,604\n962\nConsumer and others\n500\n495\n1,097\n1,221\nTotal Recoveries\n$\n3,272\n$\n914\n$\n4,759\n$\n2,262\nNet charge-offs\n(15,307)\n(19,300)\n(19,200)\n(31,154)\nProvision for credit losses - loans\n3,560\n17,650\n20,756\n30,050\nBalance at the end of the period\n$\n86,519\n$\n94,400\n$\n86,519\n$\n94,400\n75\n\nThree Months Ended June 30, 2025 and 2024\nThe Company recorded a provision for credit losses on loans of $3.6 million in the three months ended June 30, 2025, compared to $17.7 million in the same period last year. In the second quarter of 2025, the provision for credit losses on loans included $6.0 million to cover charge-offs, $2.2 million due to macro-economic factors. This was partially offset by releases of $1.5 million due to lower loan balances and $3.3 million due to recoveries.\nDuring the three months ended June 30, 2025, charge-offs decreased $1.6 million, or 8.1%, compared to the same period of the prior year.

As of June 30, 2025, there were three loans recently downgraded totaling $22.1 million with appraisals older than 12 months, for which new appraisals have been ordered. No additional provision for credit losses was deemed necessary in both periods as a result of these valuations.\nWe continue to proactively and carefully monitor the Company’s credit quality practices, including examining and responding to patterns or trends that may arise across certain industries or regions.\n77\n\nNoninterest Income\nThe table below sets forth a comparison for each of the categories of noninterest income for the periods presented.\nThree Months Ended June 30,\nChange\n2025\n2024\n2025 vs 2024\n(in thousands, except percentages)\nAmount\n%\nAmount\n%\nAmount\n%\nDeposits and service fees\n$\n4,968\n25.1\n%\n$\n5,281\n27.2\n%\n$\n(313)\n(5.9)\n%\nBrokerage, advisory and fiduciary activities\n4,993\n25.2\n%\n4,538\n23.4\n%\n455\n10.0\n%\nChange in cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance (“BOLI”) (1)\n2,490\n12.6\n%\n2,242\n11.5\n%\n248\n11.1\n%\nLoan-level derivative income (2)\n3,204\n16.2\n%\n2,357\n12.1\n%\n847\n35.9\n%\nCards and trade finance servicing fees\n1,804\n9.1\n%\n1,331\n6.9\n%\n473\n35.5\n%\nGain on early extinguishment of FHLB advances, net\n—\n—\n%\n189\n1.0\n%\n(189)\n(100.0)\n%\nDerivative losses, net (3)\n(1,852)\n(9.4)\n%\n(44)\n(0.2)\n%\n(1,808)\nN/M\nSecurities gains (losses), net (4)\n1,779\n9.0\n%\n(117)\n(0.6)\n%\n1,896\nN/M\nOther noninterest income (5)\n2,392\n12.2\n%\n3,643\n18.7\n%\n(1,251)\n(34.3)\n%\n     Total noninterest income\n$\n19,778\n100.0\n%\n$\n19,420\n100.0\n%\n$\n358\n1.8\n%\nSix Months Ended June 30,\nChange\n2025\n2024\n2025 vs 2024\n(in thousands, except percentages)\nAmount\n%\nAmount\n%\nAmount\n%\nDeposits and service fees\n10,105\n25.7\n%\n9,606\n28.3\n%\n499\n5.2\n%\nBrokerage, advisory and fiduciary activities\n9,722\n24.7\n%\n8,865\n26.1\n%\n857\n9.7\n%\nChange in cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance (“BOLI”) (1)\n4,940\n12.6\n%\n4,584\n13.5\n%\n356\n7.8\n%\nLoan-level derivative income (2)\n4,712\n12.0\n%\n2,823\n8.3\n%\n1,889\n66.9\n%\nCards and trade finance servicing fees\n3,196\n8.1\n%\n2,554\n7.5\n%\n642\n25.1\n%\nGain on early extinguishment of FHLB advances, net\n—\n—\n%\n189\n0.6\n%\n(189)\n(100.0)\n%\nDerivative losses, net (3)\n(1,852)\n(4.7)\n%\n(196)\n(0.6)\n%\n(1,656)\nN/M\nSecurities gains (losses), net (4)\n1,843\n4.7\n%\n(171)\n(0.5)\n%\n2,014\nN/M\nOther noninterest income (5)\n6,637\n16.9\n%\n5,654\n16.8\n%\n983\n17.4\n%\n     Total noninterest income\n$\n39,303\n100.00\n%\n$\n33,908\n100.00\n%\n$\n5,395\n15.91\n%\n___________\n(1)    Changes in cash surrender value of BOLI are not taxable.\n(2)    Income from interest rate swaps and other derivative transactions with customers.

These increases were partially offset by: (i) higher derivatives losses, (ii) lower other noninterest income, and (iii) lower deposits and service fees,\nIn the second quarter of 2025, the Company executed a new investment strategy and purchased $0.0 million in trading securities. In addition, in the same period, as part of this investment strategy, we entered into to-be-announced TBA MBS derivative contracts to offset the changes in market valuation on the trading securities portfolio. In the three months ended June 30, 2025, securities gains were $1.8 million, mainly unrealized gains on market valuation of the trading securities portfolio, compared to losses of $0.1 million in the same period in 2024. In the three months ended June 30, 2024, these losses related to a sale of an AFS security.

This was mainly driven by higher fees from equity and fixed income trading in the second quarter of 2025 versus second quarter of 2024.\nOur AUMs totaled $3.07 billion at June 30, 2025, an increase of $175.0 million, or 6.1%, from $2.89 billion at December 31, 2024, primarily driven by higher market valuations and, to a lesser extent, net new assets.\nOther noninterest income decreased $1.3 million, or 34.3%, in the three months ended June 30, 2025 compared to the same period in 2024, primarily driven by a $1.2 million decrease in mortgage banking income.\nDeposits and service fees decreased $0.3 million, or 5.9%, in the three months ended June 30, 2025, compared to the same period in 2024, primarily driven by lower commissions income on wire transfers.\nSix Months Ended June 30, 2025 and 2024\nTotal noninterest income increased $5.4 million, or 15.9%, in the six months ended June 30, 2025, compared to the six months ended June 30, 2024 mainly due to: (i) higher securities gains; (ii) higher loan-level derivative income; (iii) higher other non-interest income; (iv) higher brokerage, advisory and fiduciary fees; (v) higher cards and trade finance servicing fees; and (vi) higher deposits and service fees. These increases were partially offset by higher derivatives losses.\n79\n\nIn the six months ended June 30, 2025, securities gains were $1.8 million, mainly unrealized gains on market valuation of the trading securities portfolio, compared to a $0.2 million loss in the same period in 2024. In the six months ended June 30, 2024, these losses were related to the sale of an AFS security and a decrease in valuation of equity securities. Securities gains in the first half of 2025 were offset by derivatives losses of $1.9 million which consisted of net losses on the TBA MBS derivative contracts.\nLoan-level derivative income increased $1.9 million, or 66.9%, in the six months ended June 30, 2025 compared to the same period in 2024, mainly driven by new swap contracts during the period compared to the same period last year. Additionally, we recognized income associated with swap terminations during the three months ended June 30, 2025.\nOther noninterest income increased $1.0 million, or 17.4%, in the six months ended June 30, 2025 compared to the same period in 2024, primarily driven by net gains from loan note sales, including $3.2 million related to a loan note sale that was previously charged-off. The increase was partially offset by a $1.8 million decrease in mortgage banking income.\nBrokerage, advisory and fiduciary fees increased $0.9 million, or 9.7%, in the six months ended June 30, 2025, compared to the same period in 2024. This was mainly driven by higher fees from equity and fixed income trading in the first half of 2025 versus the first half of 2024.\nCards and trade finance servicing fees increased $0.6 million, or 25.1% in the six months ended June 30, 2025 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2024, mainly driven by higher commissions from the issuance of letters of credits.\nDeposits and service fees increased $0.5 million, or 5.2%, in the six months ended June 30, 2025, compared to the same period in 2024, primarily driven by an increase in statement fees on business accounts.\n80\n\nNoninterest Expense\nThe table below presents a comparison for each of the categories of noninterest expense for the periods presented.\nThree Months Ended June 30,\nChange\n2025\n2024\n2025 vs 2024\n(in thousands, except percentages)\nAmount\n%\nAmount\n%\nAmount\n%\nSalaries and employee benefits (1)\n$\n36,036\n48.4\n%\n$\n33,857\n46.2\n%\n$\n2,179\n6.4\n%\nProfessional and other services fees (2)\n13,549\n18.2\n%\n12,110\n16.5\n%\n1,439\n11.9\n%\nOccupancy and equipment (3)\n5,491\n7.4\n%\n9,041\n12.3\n%\n(3,550)\n(39.3)\n%\nTelecommunications and data processing\n2,929\n3.9\n%\n2,732\n3.7\n%\n197\n7.2\n%\nDepreciation and amortization\n1,551\n2.1\n%\n1,652\n2.3\n%\n(101)\n(6.1)\n%\nFDIC assessments and insurance\n2,896\n3.9\n%\n2,772\n3.8\n%\n124\n4.5\n%\nLosses on loans held for sale carried at the lower cost or fair value (4)\n—\n—\n%\n1,258\n1.7\n%\n(1,258)\n(100.0)\n%\nAdvertising expenses\n4,819\n6.5\n%\n4,243\n5.8\n%\n576\n13.6\n%\nLoan-level derivative expense (5)\n1,113\n1.5\n%\n580\n0.8\n%\n533\n91.9\n%\nOther real estate owned and repossessed assets expense (income), net (6)\n601\n0.8\n%\n(148)\n(0.2)\n%\n749\n(506.1)\n%\nOther operating expenses(7)\n5,415\n7.3\n%\n5,205\n7.1\n%\n210\n4.0\n%\n     Total noninterest expenses (8)\n$\n74,400\n100.0\n%\n$\n73,302\n100.0\n%\n$\n1,098\n1.5\n%\nSix Months Ended June 30,\nChange\n2025\n2024\n2025 vs 2024\n(in thousands, except percentages)\nAmount\n%\nAmount\n%\nAmount\n%\nSalaries and employee benefits (1)\n69,383\n47.5\n%\n66,815\n47.8\n%\n2,568\n3.8\n%\nProfessional and other services fees (2)\n28,231\n19.3\n%\n23,073\n16.5\n%\n5,158\n22.4\n%\nOccupancy and equipment (3)\n11,627\n8.0\n%\n15,517\n11.1\n%\n(3,890)\n(25.1)\n%\nTelecommunications and data processing\n6,404\n4.4\n%\n6,265\n4.5\n%\n139\n2.2\n%\nDepreciation and amortization\n3,139\n2.2\n%\n3,129\n2.2\n%\n10\n0.3\n%\nFDIC assessments and insurance\n6,132\n4.2\n%\n5,780\n4.1\n%\n352\n6.1\n%\nLosses on loans held for sale carried at the of lower cost or fair value (4)\n—\n—\n%\n1,258\n0.9\n%\n(1,258)\n(100.0)\n%\nAdvertising expenses\n8,454\n5.8\n%\n7,321\n5.2\n%\n1,133\n15.5\n%\nLoan-level derivative expense (5)\n1,473\n1.0\n%\n584\n0.4\n%\n889\n152.2\n%\nOther real estate owned and repossessed assets expense (income), net (6)\n765\n0.5\n%\n(502)\n(0.4)\n%\n1,267\n(252.4)\n%\nOther operating expenses(7)\n10,346\n7.1\n%\n10,656\n7.7\n%\n(310)\n(2.9)\n%\n     Total noninterest expenses (8)\n$\n145,954\n100.0\n%\n$\n139,896\n100.0\n%\n$\n6,058\n4.3\n%\n____\n(1)   In each of the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2025, includes $0.4 million in expenses in connection with the\n Amerant Mortgage downsizing.\n(2)   In each of the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2024, includes $0.3 million in legal expenses in connection with the\n   Houston Transaction.

These increases were partially offset by: (i) lower occupancy and equipment expenses, and (ii) the absence of a $1.2 million valuation expense on loans held for sale at the lower of cost or fair value in the second quarter of 2024.\nSalaries and employee benefits increased $2.2 million, or 6.4%, in the three months ended June 30, 2025 compared to the same period one year ago, mainly driven by higher salary expense as a result of the new hires in the period and higher severance expenses.

This was mainly due to losses on sale of two OREO properties in the second quarter of 2025.\nAdvertising expenses increased $0.6 million, or 13.6%, in the three months ended June 30, 2025 compared to the same period last year. This was mainly driven by higher expenses related to traditional media and professional sports agreements.\nLoan-level derivative expenses increased $0.5 million, or 91.9%, in the three months ended June 30, 2025, compared to the same period last year due to higher expenses during the period associated with payments for opening of new swaps and caps with clients.\nOccupancy and equipment expenses decreased $3.6 million, or 39.3%, in the three months ended June 30, 2025 compared to the same period one year ago mainly driven by the absence of a $3.4 million fixed assets impairment charge in the second quarter of 2024 in connection with the Houston Transaction.\n82\n\nSix Months Ended June 30, 2025 and 2024\nNoninterest expense increased $6.1 million, or 4.3%, in the six months ended June 30, 2025 compared to the same period in 2024, mainly due to: (i) higher professional and other service fees; (ii)  higher salary and employee benefits; (iii) higher net OREO and repossessed assets expenses; (iv) higher advertising expenses, and (iv) higher loan-level derivative expenses. These increases were partially offset by: (i) lower occupancy and equipment expenses, and (ii) the absence of a $1.2 million valuation expense on loans held for sale at the lower of cost or fair value in the first half of 2024.\nProfessional and other services fees increased $5.2 million, or 22.4%, in the six months ended June 30, 2025 compared to the same period last year. This was mainly driven by an overall increase in other professional fees related to outsourced core software and technology services, mortgage servicing expenses, accounting fees in connection with outsourced audit fees and consulting and legal fees related to various projects.\nSalaries and employee benefits increased $2.6 million, or 3.8%, in the six months ended June 30, 2025 compared to the same period one year ago, mainly driven by: (i) higher salary expense as a result of the new hires, and (ii) higher severance expenses. This was partially offset by lower equity variable compensation in connection with the long-term incentive program mainly attributable to the effect of forfeitures during the period.\nOther real estate owned and repossessed assets expenses increased $1.3 million, or 252.4%, in the six months ended June 30, 2025, compared to the same period last year. This was mainly due to losses on sale and valuation  expense on OREO properties during the first half of 2025.\nAdvertising expenses increased $1.1 million, or 15.5%, in the six months ended June 30, 2025 compared to the same period last year. This was mainly driven by higher expenses related to traditional media and professional sports agreements as well as higher expenses related to community engagement events.\nLoan-level derivative expenses increased $0.9 million in the six months ended June 30, 2025, compared to the same period last year due to higher expenses during the period associated with payments for opening of new swaps and caps with clients.\nOccupancy and equipment expenses decreased $3.9 million, or 25.1%, in the six months ended June 30, 2025 compared to the same period one year ago primarily due to: (i) the absence of a $3.4 million fixed assets impairment charge in the second quarter of 2024 in connection with the Houston Transaction,  (ii) fewer banking centers as a result of the Houston Sale Transaction, and (iii) an increase in sublease income from additional subleasing of portions of the headquarter building.\n83\n\nIncome Taxes\nThe table below sets forth information related to our income taxes for the periods presented.\nThree Months Ended June 30,\nChange\nSix Months Ended June 30,\nChange\n2025\n2024\n2025 vs 2024\n2025\n2024\n2025 vs 2024\n(in thousands, except effective tax rates and percentages)\nIncome before income tax expense\n$\n29,797\n$\n6,323\n$\n23,474\n371.3\n%\n$\n45,226\n$\n19,785\n$\n25,441\n128.6\n%\nIncome tax expense\n$\n6,795\n$\n1,360\n$\n5,435\n399.6\n%\n$\n10,266\n$\n4,254\n$\n6,012\n141.3\n%\nEffective income tax rate\n22.80\n%\n21.51\n%\n1.29\n%\n6.0\n%\n22.70\n%\n21.50\n%\n1.20\n%\n5.6\n%\nIncome tax expense increased to $6.8 million in the second quarter of 2025 from $1.4 million in the second quarter of 2024, and to $10.3 million in the first half of 2025 from $4.3 million in the first half of 2024, mainly driven by higher income before income taxes in the 2025 periods compared to the same periods last year.\nAs of June 30, 2025, the Company’s net deferred tax assets were $51.0 million, a decrease of $2.6 million, or 4.8%, compared to $53.5 million as of December 31, 2024. This was primarily driven by a decrease of $5.0 million in connection with $19.4 million in net unrealized holding gains on debt securities available for sale during the period, partially offset by the tax effect of an increase in the allowance for credit losses.\nOn July 4, 2025, federal legislation generally referred to as H.R. 1 - One Big Beautiful Bill Act (the “Act”) was signed into law. The Act includes a variety of tax provisions including permanently extending and modifying certain key aspects of existing tax law.\n\nU.S. GAAP requires the effects of changes in tax laws and rates to be recognized in its financial statements in the period in which legislation is enacted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the Act on its consolidated financial statements; however, the Company does not anticipate a material impact resulting from the Act.\n84\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe Company supplements its financial results that are determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) with non-GAAP financial measures, such as “pre-provision net revenue (PPNR)”, “core pre-provision net revenue (Core PPNR)”, “core noninterest income”, and “core noninterest expense”. This supplemental information is not required by, or is not presented in accordance with GAAP. The Company refers to these financial measures and ratios as “non-GAAP financial measures”.\nWe use certain non-GAAP financial measures, including those mentioned above, both to explain our results to shareholders and the investment community and in the internal evaluation and management of our business. Management believes that these supplementary non-GAAP financial measures and the information they provide are useful to investors since these measures permit investors to view our performance using the same tools that our management uses to evaluate our past performance and prospects for future performance. These non-GAAP financial measures have been adjusted for the effect of non-core banking activities such as the sale of loans and securities, the Amerant Mortgage downsizing, the Houston Transaction, the valuation of securities, derivatives, loans held for sale and other real estate owned and repossessed assets. While we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating our performance, this information should be considered as supplemental and not as a substitute for or superior to the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from similar measures presented by other companies.\n85\n\nThe following table is a reconciliation of the Company’s PPNR, Core PPNR, core noninterest income and core noninterest expense, non-GAAP financial measures, as of the dates presented:\nThree Months Ended June 30,\nSix Months Ended June 30,\n(in thousands)\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nNet income attributable to Amerant Bancorp Inc.\n$\n23,002\n$\n4,963\n$\n34,960\n$\n15,531\nPlus: provision for credit losses (1)\n6,060\n19,150\n24,506\n31,550\nPlus: provision for income tax expense\n6,795\n1,360\n10,266\n4,254\nPre-provision net revenue (PPNR)\n35,857\n25,473\n69,732\n51,335\nPlus: non-routine noninterest expense items\n1,192\n5,562\n1,726\n5,562\nLess: non-routine noninterest income items\n73\n(28)\n(2,790)\n178\nCore pre-provision net revenue (Core PPNR)\n$\n37,122\n$\n31,007\n$\n68,668\n$\n57,075\nTotal noninterest income\n$\n19,778\n$\n19,420\n$\n39,303\n$\n33,908\nLess: Non-routine noninterest income items:\nDerivatives losses, net (2)\n(1,852)\n(44)\n(1,852)\n(196)\nSecurities gain (losses), net (3)\n1,779\n(117)\n1,843\n(171)\nGain on sale of loans (4)\n—\n—\n2,799\n—\nGains on early extinguishment of FHLB advances, net\n—\n189\n—\n189\nTotal non-routine noninterest income (loss) items\n$\n(73)\n$\n28\n$\n2,790\n$\n(178)\nCore noninterest income\n$\n19,851\n$\n19,392\n$\n36,513\n$\n34,086\nTotal noninterest expenses\n$\n74,400\n$\n73,302\n$\n145,954\n$\n139,896\nLess: non-routine noninterest expense items\nOther non-routine noninterest expense items:\nLosses on loans held for sale carried at the lower of cost or fair value (5)\n—\n1,258\n—\n1,258\nGoodwill and intangible assets impairment (5)\n—\n300\n—\n300\nLegal and broker fees (5)\n—\n561\n—\n561\nOther real estate owned valuation expense (6)\n822\n—\n1,356\n—\nAmerant Mortgage Downsize costs (7)\n370\n—\n370\n—\nFixed assets impairment (5)(8)\n—\n3,443\n—\n3,443\nTotal non-routine noninterest expense items\n$\n1,192\n$\n5,562\n$\n1,726\n$\n5,562\nCore noninterest expenses\n$\n73,208\n$\n67,740\n$\n144,228\n$\n134,334\n(1) Includes provision for credit losses on loans and provision for loan contingencies.\n(2) In the three and six months ended June 30, 2025, includes net unrealized losses in connection with to-be-announced (TBA)  mortgage back-securities (MBS) derivative contracts.

This result was primarily driven by increases of: (i) $473.0 million, or 31.6%, in total securities, mainly debt securities available for sale and trading securities; (ii) $46.5 million, or 7.9%, in cash and cash equivalents; (iii) $11.9 million, or 4.9%, in BOLI mainly driven by a newly purchased policy and the change in cash surrender values during the first half of 2025. The increases were partially offset by decreases of: (i) $83.7 million, or 1.2%, in total loans held for investment and loans held for sale, net of the ACL; and (ii)  $14.4 million, or 8.1%, in accrued interest receivable and other assets.\nSee\n “-Average Balance Sheet, Interest and Yield/Rate Analysis” for detailed information, including changes in the composition of our interest-earning assets.\nCash and Cash Equivalents.\nCash and cash equivalents increased to $636.8 million at June 30, 2025 from $590.4 million at December 31, 2024, primarily as a result of an increase in interest earning cash balances.\nAt June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, interest earning deposits with banks, mainly cash balances held at the Federal Reserve, were $573.4 million and $519.9 million, respectively. In addition, at June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the Company’s cash and cash equivalents included restricted cash of $8.0 million and $24.4 million, respectively, which was held primarily to cover margin calls on derivative transactions with certain brokers. Furthermore, at June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the Company’s cash and cash equivalents included other short-term investments of $7.1 million and $6.9 million, respectively, which consist of US Treasury Bills that mature in 90 days or less.\nCash and cash equivalents provided by operating activities were $77.8 million in the six months ended June 30, 2025, mainly driven by: (i) net sales of $30.8 million in loans held for sale at a fair value; (ii) a non-cash adjustment of $24.5 million for the provision for credit losses, and (iii) net income of $35.0 million. These results were partially offset by a net decrease of $9.2 million in operating assets and liabilities and other non-cash adjustments of $3.3 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $425.2 million during the six months ended June 30, 2025, mainly driven by: (i) purchases of investment securities totaling $546.3 million, mainly comprised of debt securities available for sale and trading securities; (ii) proceeds from the sale of loans originated for investment of $24.6 million, and (iii) purchases of BOLI of  $7.0 million. These disbursements were partially offset by: (i) maturities, sales, calls and paydowns of investment securities totaling $93.5 million; and (ii) a net decrease in loans originated for investment of $11.0 million.\n88\nIn the six months ended June 30, 2025, net cash provided by financing activities was $393.8 million, mainly due to: (i) an increase in total demand, savings and money market deposit balances of $523.5 million, and (ii) net proceeds from advances from the FHLB of $20.0 million.This was partially offset by: (i) a net decrease of $71.5 million in time deposits; (ii) the redemption of $60.0 million of senior notes that were due June 30, 2025; (iii) an aggregate of $10.0 million of Class A common stock repurchased in the six months ended June 30, 2025; and (iv) $7.7 million of dividends declared and paid by the Company in the six months ended June 30, 2025.\nSee\n “-Capital Resources and Liquidity Management” for more details on changes in FHLB advances and common stock transactions in the six months ended June 30, 2025.\n   Loans\nLoans are our largest component of interest-earning assets.

In the first quarter of 2025, the Company transferred a loan of $40.6 million from loans held for investment to to held for sale, at the lower of cost or fair value, and no valuation allowance was recorded as part of this transaction.  In April 2025, the Company determined that it no longer plans the sale of this loan and, therefore, in April 2025, reclassified the loan to its held for investment loan portfolio.\n As of June 30, 2025, total loans held for investment were $7.2 billion, down $45.3 million, or 0.6%, compared to December 31, 2024. Domestic loans held for investment decreased $40.1 million, or 0.6%, as of June 30, 2025, compared to December 31, 2024. The decrease in total domestic loans held for investment includes: (i)  $185.2 million, or 10.6%, in domestic commercial loans; (ii) $24.5 million, or 9.0%, in domestic consumer loans, mainly purchased indirect consumer loans as the Company discontinued purchases of these loans in 2023 and this portfolio is set to runoff over time; (iii) $24.0 million, or 2.4%, in domestic owner occupied loans, and (iv) $13.5 million, or 7.9% in loans to financial institutions and acceptances. These decreases were partially offset by a net increases of: (i) $187.9 million, or 7.5% in domestic CRE loans; and (ii) $19.1 million, or 1.3% in domestic single-family residential loans.\nIn the six months ended June 30, 2025, the Company has added approximately $90.0 million in single-family residential and construction loans through Amerant Mortgage, which includes loans originated and purchased from different channels.\n Loans to international customers, primarily from Venezuela and other customers in Latin America decreased $5.1 million, or 12.6%, in the six months ended June 30, 2025, mainly driven by repayments totaling $4.8 million to existing single family residential loans.\n  As of\nJune 30, 2025\n, loans under syndication facilities, included in loans held for investment, were\n$379.9 million\n, a decrease of\n$13.8 million\n, or\n3.5%\n, compared to $393.7 million at\nDecember 31, 2024\n. This was mainly driven by the paydown of five commercial loans totaling $40.9 million partially offset by an increase of four construction loans, three commercial loan totaling $18.4 million and $11.5 million, respectively, and other minor balance changes totaling $2.8 million. As of\nJune 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024\n, there were no SNC loans that financed highly leveraged transactions.\n92\nLoan Quality\nAllocation of Allowance for Credit Losses\nIn the following table, we present the allocation of the ACL by loan segment at the end of the periods presented. The amounts shown in this table should not be interpreted as an indication that charge-offs in future periods will occur in these amounts or percentages. These amounts represent our best estimates of expected credit losses to be collected throughout the life of the loans, at the reported dates, derived from historical events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts at the dates reported. Our allowance for credit losses is established using estimates and judgments, which consider the views of our regulators in their periodic examinations. Re-evaluation of the ACL estimate in future periods, in light of changes in composition and characteristics of the loan portfolio, changes in the reasonable and supportable forecast and other factors then prevailing may result in material changes in the amount of the ACL and credit loss expense in those future periods.

During the six months ended June 30, 2025, the Company enhanced certain of its modeled macroeconomic factors to improve the stability of the model.\n93\nNon-Performing Assets\nIn the following table, we present a summary of our non-performing assets by loan class, which includes non-performing loans by portfolio segment, both domestic and international, and other real estate owned, or OREO and other repossessed assets, at the dates presented.

The remaining downgrades included other smaller classified loans. These results were partially offset by charge offs and paydowns during the period.\nClassified loans include 9 loans totaling $134.4 million that remain in accruing status. Classified accruing loans include: (i) $21.3 million in a CRE loan to a customer in the hospitality service sector in Florida; (ii) $33.2 million CRE retail property loans; (iii) $8.3 in a CRE multifamily loan in New York; (iv) $31.1 million in three commercial loans in the restaurant and transportation industry; and (v) a $40.5 million owner-occupied loan to a customer in the restaurant service sector in Florida.\nIn July 2025, the Company downgraded to substandard accrual a total of $55.6 million, which included one CRE loan from Pass, one CRE loan from Special Mention, and two commercial loans from Pass. Additionally, the Company collected a total of $53.0 million in full satisfaction, which included two CRE accruing loans and one commercial non-performing loan. There were no additional charges as a result of this activity.\nIn February 2025, the Company decided to sell the aforementioned $40.6 million substandard accruing owner-occupied loan. The Company transferred this loan from loans held for investment to loans held for sale, at the lower of cost or fair value, and determined no valuation allowance was required at the time of the transfer. In April 2025, the Company determined that it no longer plans the sale of this loan and, therefore, in April 2025, reclassified the loan to its held for investment loan portfolio.\nSpecial Mention Loans.\n The following table presents the activity of special mention loans by type of loan in the six months ended June 30, 2025:\n97\nSix Months Ended June 30, 2025\n(in thousands)\nCommercial Real Estate\nSingle-family Residential\nOwner-occupied\nCommercial\nFinancial Institutions\nConsumer and Others\nTotal\nBalance at beginning of period\n$\n361\n$\n—\n$\n5,047\n$\n—\n$\n—\n$\n—\n$\n5,408\nDowngrades to Special Mention\n91,300\n—\n18,649\n80,263\n—\n—\n190,212\nUpgrades to Pass\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\nDowngrades to Substandard\n(20,644)\n—\n—\n(16,793)\n—\n—\n(37,437)\nPayoffs/Paydowns\n(359)\n—\n(2,620)\n(22,445)\n—\n—\n(25,424)\nBalances at end of period\n$\n70,658\n$\n—\n$\n21,076\n$\n41,025\n$\n—\n$\n—\n$\n132,759\nAll special mention loans remained current at June 30, 2025.\nThe increase in Special mention loans was primarily driven by 8 commercial loans in multiple industries totaling $80.3 million. These commercial loans were downgraded based on receipt of year-end 2024 and first quarter 2025 financials. In addition, the increase in special mention loans include seven CRE  loans totaling $91.3 million. While certain milestones were missed by the borrowers, there are acceptable mitigating factors in place, such as adequate loan-to-value, interest reserves or other structural enhancements. These increases were partially offset by  $16.8 million in upgrades to Pass, $25.4 million in payoffs and $20.6 million in downgrades to Substandard.\nPotential problem loans, which are accruing loans classified as substandard and are less than 90 days past due, at June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, are as follows:\n(in thousands)\nJune 30, 2025\nDecember 31, 2024\nReal estate loans\nCommercial real estate (CRE)\nNon-owner occupied\n$\n54,360\n$\n21,430\nMulti-family residential\n8,284\n—\nLand development and construction loans\n—\n—\n62,644\n21,430\nSingle-family residential (1)\n—\n227\nOwner occupied\n40,563\n40,847\n103,207\n62,504\nCommercial loans\n31,059\n—\n$\n134,266\n$\n62,504\n__________\n(1) Corresponds to both domestic and international single-family residential loans.\nAt June 30, 2025 total potential problem loans increased to $134.3 million compared to $62.5 million at December 31, 2024. This was mainly due to a downgrade to substandard of 2 CRE retail loans totaling $32.9 million, 1 CRE multifamily loan totaling $8.3 million, and 3 commercial loans totaling $31.1 million in the restaurant and transportation industry.\n98\nSecurities\nThe following table sets forth the book value and percentage of each category of securities at June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024. The book value for trading securities, debt securities classified as available for sale and equity securities with readily determinable fair value not held for trading represents fair value. The Company determined that an ACL on its debt securities available for sale at June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024 was not required.

The Fund’s objective is to provide a high level of current income consistent with the preservation of capital and investments deemed to be qualified under the Community Reinvestment Act.\n(3)    In the three months ended June 30, 2025, the Company began participating in trading of MBS as part of its investment portfolio strategy.\n(4)    Includes investments in FHLB and Federal Reserve stock. Amounts correspond to original cost at the date presented. Original cost approximates fair value because of the nature of these investments.\nAs of June 30, 2025, total securities increased $473.0 million, or 31.6%, to $1.97 billion compared to $1.50 billion at December 31, 2024. The increase in the six months ended June 30, 2025 was mainly driven by: (i) purchases of debt securities held for sale, trading securities and FHLB stock totaling $546.3 million; and (ii) net pre-tax unrealized gains of $19.4 million on debt securities available for sale primarily attributable to changes in market interest rates during the current period . This increase was partially offset by: maturities, sales, calls and pay downs, totaling $93.5 million.\n99\nDebt securities available for sale had net unrealized holding losses of $39.1 million and net unrealized holding gains of $3.7 million at June 30, 2025, compared to December 31, 2024 when net unrealized holding losses were $55.7 million and net unrealized holding gains were $0.9 million.  The Company does not intend to sell these debt securities and it is more likely than not that it will not be required to sell the securities before their anticipated recovery. The Company believes these securities are not credit-impaired because the change in fair value is attributable to changes in interest rates and investment securities markets, generally, and not credit quality. As a result, the Company did not record an ACL on these securities as of June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024.\nThe Company does not have any debt securities classified as held to maturity at June 30, 2025.\n The following tables set forth the book value, scheduled maturities and weighted average yields for our securities portfolio at June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024. Similar to the table above, the book value for securities available for sale, trading securities and equity securities with readily determinable fair value not held for trading is equal to fair market value and the book value for debt securities held to maturity is equal to amortized cost less an ACL if required.\nJune 30, 2025\n(in thousands, except percentages)\nTotal\nLess than a year\nOne to five years\nFive to ten years\nOver ten years\nNo maturity\nAmount\nYield\nAmount\nYield\nAmount\nYield\nAmount\nYield\nAmount\nYield\nAmount\nYield\nDebt securities available for sale\nNon agency commercial MBS\n$\n12,037\n2.98\n%\n$\n—\n—\n%\n$\n—\n—\n%\n$\n—\n—\n%\n$\n12,037\n2.98\n%\n$\n—\n—\n%\nU.S. Government agency and sponsored enterprise obligations\n14,123\n4.98\n%\n2\n0.13\n%\n2,839\n5.20\n%\n1,086\n5.68\n%\n10,196\n4.84\n%\n—\n—\n%\nMunicipal bonds\n1,531\n2.33\n%\n—\n—\n%\n—\n—\n%\n346\n1.72\n%\n1,185\n2.51\n%\n—\n—\n%\nU.S. Treasury Securities\n1,972\n4.22\n%\n1,972\n4.22\n%\n—\n—\n%\n—\n—\n%\n—\n—\n%\n—\n—\n%\nU.S. Government agency and sponsored enterprise commercial MBS\n143,292\n4.19\n%\n—\n—\n%\n47,550\n3.72\n%\n35,944\n4.00\n%\n59,798\n4.67\n%\n—\n—\n%\nU.S. Government agency and sponsored enterprise residential MBS\n1,615,753\n4.93\n%\n3\n3.50\n%\n937\n5.29\n%\n6,366\n4.58\n%\n1,608,447\n4.93\n%\n—\n—\n%\n$\n1,788,708\n4.86\n%\n$\n1,977\n4.21\n%\n$\n51,326\n3.83\n%\n$\n43,742\n4.11\n%\n$\n1,691,663\n4.90\n%\n$\n—\n—\n%\nEquity securities with readily determinable fair value not held for trading\n2,525\n3.41\n%\n—\n—\n%\n—\n—\n%\n—\n—\n%\n—\n—\n%\n2,525\n3.41\n%\nTrading securities\n120,226\n5.41\n%\n—\n—\n%\n—\n—\n%\n—\n—\n%\n120,226\n5.41\n%\n—\n—\n%\nOther securities\n$\n59,429\n6.63\n%\n$\n—\n—\n%\n$\n—\n—\n%\n$\n—\n—\n%\n$\n—\n—\n%\n$\n59,429\n6.63\n%\n$\n1,970,888\n4.95\n%\n$\n1,977\n4.21\n%\n$\n51,326\n3.83\n%\n$\n43,742\n4.11\n%\n$\n1,811,889\n4.94\n%\n$\n61,954\n6.50\n%\n100\nDecember 31, 2024\n(in thousands, except percentages)\nTotal\nLess than a year\nOne to five years\nFive to ten years\nOver ten years\nNo maturity\nAmount\nYield\nAmount\nYield\nAmount\nYield\nAmount\nYield\nAmount\nYield\nAmount\nYield\nDebt securities available for sale\nNon-Agency Commercial MBS\n$\n11,792\n3.51\n%\n$\n—\n—\n%\n$\n—\n—\n%\n$\n—\n—\n%\n$\n11,792\n3.51\n%\n$\n—\n—\n%\nU.S. Government Agency and Sponsored Enterprise Obligations\n$\n16,682\n5.45\n%\n11\n—\n%\n2,146\n5.42\n%\n2,346\n5.59\n%\n12,179\n5.41\n%\n—\n—\n%\nMunicipal Bonds\n$\n1,585\n2.38\n%\n—\n—\n%\n—\n—\n%\n343\n1.79\n%\n1,242\n2.54\n%\n—\n—\n%\nU.S. Treasury Securities\n$\n1,933\n4.22\n%\n1,933\n4.22\n%\n—\n—\n%\n—\n—\n%\n—\n—\n%\n—\n—\n%\nU.S. Government Agency and Sponsored Enterprise Commercial MBS\n$\n142,538\n4.17\n%\n206\n2.87\n%\n37,972\n3.70\n%\n43,051\n3.72\n%\n61,309\n4.77\n%\n—\n—\n%\nU.S. Government Agency and Sponsored Enterprise Residential MBS\n$\n1,262,640\n4.86\n%\n$\n42\n3.10\n%\n1,154\n5.42\n%\n6,844\n4.61\n%\n1,254,600\n4.86\n%\n—\n—\n%\n$\n1,437,170\n4.78\n%\n$\n2,192\n4.05\n%\n$\n41,272\n3.84\n%\n$\n52,584\n3.91\n%\n$\n1,341,122\n4.85\n%\n$\n—\n—\n%\nEquity securities with readily determinable fair value not held for trading\n2,477\n3.03\n%\n—\n—\n%\n—\n—\n%\n—\n—\n%\n—\n—\n%\n2,477\n3.03\n%\nOther securities\n$\n58,278\n6.95\n%\n$\n—\n—\n%\n$\n—\n—\n%\n$\n—\n—\n%\n$\n—\n—\n%\n$\n58,278\n6.95\n%\n$\n1,497,925\n4.87\n%\n$\n2,192\n4.05\n%\n$\n41,272\n3.84\n%\n$\n52,584\n3.91\n%\n$\n1,341,122\n4.85\n%\n$\n60,755\n6.79\n%\nThe investment portfolio’s weighted expected average effective duration decreased to 4.4 years at June 30, 2025  compared to 5.2 years at December 31, 2024, due to higher prepayment assumptions due to projections of lower market rates, and higher composition of variable-rate investments that result in a lower weighted average duration.\n101\nLiabilities\nTotal liabilities were $9.41 billion at June 30, 2025, an increase of $399.1 million, or 4.4%, compared to $9.0 billion at December 31, 2024. This was primarily driven by an increase of  $451.9 million, or 5.8%, in total deposits, mainly due to an increase in core deposits, and (ii) $20.0 million, or 2.7%, in advances from the FHLB. This increase was partially offset by: (i) the redemption of $60 million of senior notes that were due June 30, 2025; and (ii)  $16.2 million, or 10.7%, in accounts payable, accrued liabilities and other liabilities.\nSee\n “Capital Resources and Liquidity Management” and “Deposits” for more details on the changes in advances from the FHLB and total deposits.\nSee\n “Our Company- Business Developments” for additional information.\nDeposits\nWe continue with our efforts in growing our deposits. Our efforts include the additions of new team members to our business development teams across South Florida and Tampa in the first six months of 2025.\nTotal deposits were $8.31 billion at June 30, 2025, an increase of $451.9 million, or 5.8%, compared to December 31, 2024. The increase in deposits in the six months ended June 30, 2025 was mainly due to an increase of: (i) $269.5 million, or 14.3%, in savings and money market deposits; (ii) $201.8 million, or 13.4%, in noninterest bearing demand deposits; and (iii) $52.1 million, or 2.3%, in interest-bearing deposits. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $71.5 million, or 3.2%, in time deposits.\nThe $71.5 million, or 3.2%, net decrease in time deposits includes decreases of: (i) $67.0 million, or 9.5%, in brokered time deposits; and (ii) $4.5 million, or 0.3% in customer CDs.\nAs of June 30, 2025 total brokered deposits were $644.0 million, a decrease of $57.9 million, or 8.3%, compared to $701.9 million at December 31, 2024.\nDeposits by Country of Domicile\nThe following table shows deposits by country of domicile of the depositor as of the dates presented and the changes during the period.\nChange\n(in thousands, except percentages)\nJune 30, 2025\nDecember 31, 2024\nAmount\n%\nDeposits\nDomestic (1)\n$\n5,707,272\n$\n5,278,289\n$\n428,983\n8.1\n%\nForeign:\nVenezuela (2)\n1,897,631\n1,889,331\n8,300\n0.4\n%\nOthers (3)\n701,641\n686,975\n14,666\n2.1\n%\nTotal foreign\n2,599,272\n2,576,306\n22,966\n0.9\n%\nTotal deposits\n$\n8,306,544\n$\n7,854,595\n$\n451,949\n5.8\n%\n_________________\n(1)    Includes brokered deposits of $644.0 million and $701.9 million at June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively.\n(2)    Based upon the diligence we customarily perform to \"know our customers\" for anti-money laundering, OFAC and sanctions purposes, we believe that the U.S. economic embargo on certain Venezuelan persons will not adversely affect our Venezuelan customer relationships, generally.\n(3)    Our other foreign deposits do not include deposits from Venezuelan resident customers.\n102\nOur domestic deposits increased $429.0 million, or 8.1%, in the six months ended June 30, 2025, primarily driven by increases of: (i) $241.5 million in savings and money market accounts; (ii) $197.4 million in domestic noninterest bearing accounts; and (iii) $82.8 million in domestic interest bearing accounts. These increases were partially offset by decreases of: (i)  $77.0 million in domestic brokered time deposits; and (ii) $15.7 million in domestic customer time deposits.\nDuring the six months ended June 30, 2025, total foreign deposits increased $23.0 million, or 0.9%, primarily driven by an increase of $14.7 million, or 2.1%, in deposits from countries other than Venezuela, mostly savings and money market and time deposits. In addition, there was an increase of $8.3 million, or 0.4%, in deposits from customers domiciled in Venezuela, mostly in time deposits.\n Core Deposits\n Our core deposits were $6.1 billion and $5.6 billion as of June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively. Core deposits represented 74.0% and 71.6% of our total deposits at those dates, respectively. The increase of $523.5 million, or 9.3%, in core deposits in the six months ended June 30, 2025 was mainly driven by increases in savings and money market deposits, noninterest bearing demand deposits as well as interest bearing demand deposits. We define “core deposits” as total deposits excluding all time deposits.\n Brokered Deposits\nWe utilize brokered deposits primarily as an asset/liability management tool. As of June 30, 2025, we had $644.0 million in brokered deposits, which represented 7.8% of our total deposits at that date (8.9% as of December 31, 2024). As of June 30, 2025, brokered deposits decreased $57.9 million, or 8.3%, compared to $701.9 million as of December 31, 2024, mainly due to maturities of brokered time deposits, partially offset by an increase in brokered non-time deposits during the period. As of June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, brokered deposits included time deposits of $634.9 million and $701.9 million, respectively. As of June 30, 2025, there were $9.1 million in brokered non-time deposits which consists of an aggregate of $8.1 million interest bearing demand and money market brokered deposits and $1.0 million in noninterest bearing brokered deposits, while there were no brokered non-time deposits as of December 31, 2024. The Company has not historically sold brokered CDs in individual denominations over $100,000.\n Large Fund Providers\nLarge fund providers consist of third party relationships with balances over $20 million. At June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, our large fund providers included 17 and 20 deposit relationships, respectively, with total balances of $1.1 billion and $942.3 million, respectively. The increase in balances from large fund providers in the six months ended June 30, 2025 was mainly driven by an increase in large deposits from commercial customers  as the Company continues its focus on depository relationships.\n103\nLarge Time Deposits by Maturity\nThe following table sets forth the maturities of our time deposits with individual balances equal to or greater than $100,000 as of June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024:\nJune 30, 2025\nDecember 31, 2024\n(in thousands, except percentages)\nLess than 3 months\n$\n340,121\n27.0\n%\n$\n386,857\n30.4\n%\n3 to 6 months\n475,966\n37.8\n%\n349,673\n27.5\n%\n6 to 12 months\n385,281\n30.6\n%\n464,812\n36.6\n%\n1 to 3 years\n42,036\n3.3\n%\n53,745\n4.2\n%\nOver 3 years\n16,607\n1.3\n%\n15,386\n1.3\n%\nTotal\n$\n1,260,011\n100.0\n%\n$\n1,270,473\n100.0\n%\nShort-Term Borrowings\nIn addition to deposits, we use short-term borrowings from time to time, such as advances from the FHLB and borrowings from other banks, as a source of funds to meet the daily liquidity needs of our customers and fund growth in earning assets. Short-term borrowings have maturities of 12 months or less as of the reported period-end.\nShort-term borrowings outstanding at June 30, 2025 matured in July 2025 (balance outstanding at December 31, 2024 matured in January 2025). All of our outstanding short-term borrowings at December 31, 2024 corresponded to advances from the FHLB. There were no other borrowings or repurchase agreements outstanding at June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024.\nThe following table sets forth information about the outstanding amounts of our short-term borrowings at the close of, and for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nJune 30,\n2025\nDecember 31,\n2024\n(in thousands, except percentages)\nOutstanding at period-end\n$\n50,000\n$\n30,000\nAverage amount\n8,333\n2,500\nMaximum amount outstanding at any month-end\n50,000\n30,000\nWeighted average interest rate:\n  During period\n4.58\n%\n4.44\n%\n  End of period\n4.58\n%\n4.44\n%\n104\nReturn on Equity and Assets\nThe following table shows annualized return on average assets, return on average equity, and average equity to average assets ratio for the periods presented:\nThree Months Ended June 30,\nSix Months Ended June 30,\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\n(in thousands, except percentages and per share data)\nNet income attributable to the Company\n$\n23,002\n$\n4,963\n$\n34,960\n$\n15,531\nBasic earnings per common share\n0.55\n0.15\n0.83\n0.46\nDiluted earnings per common share (1)\n0.55\n0.15\n0.83\n0.46\nAverage total assets\n$\n10,256,254\n$\n9,729,666\n$\n10,149,983\n$\n9,742,117\nAverage stockholders' equity\n917,010\n743,458\n914,133\n745,041\nNet income attributable to the Company / Average total assets (ROA)\n0.90\n%\n0.21\n%\n0.69\n%\n0.32\n%\nNet income attributable to the Company / Average stockholders' equity (ROE)\n10.06\n%\n2.68\n%\n7.71\n%\n4.19\n%\nAverage stockholders' equity / Average total assets ratio\n8.94\n%\n7.64\n%\n9.01\n%\n7.65\n%\n__________________\n(1)\nIn the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, potential dilutive instruments consisted of unvested shares of restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance share units. S\nee\n Note 13 to our unaudited interim consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q for details on the dilutive effects of the issuance of restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance share units on earnings per share for the six month periods ended June 30, 2025 and 2024.\n\nDuring the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2025, basic and diluted earnings per share increased compared to the same period one year ago, primarily driven by improved net income in the current periods compared to the same periods last year. These results were partially offset by an increase in the weighted average number of shares as a result of the Company’s public offering of its Class A common stock that was completed in September 2024.\nCapital Resources and Liquidity Management\nCapital Resources\nStockholders’ equity is influenced primarily by earnings, dividends, if any, and changes in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss (AOCI/AOCL) caused primarily by fluctuations in unrealized holding gains or losses, net of taxes, on debt securities available for sale and derivative instruments. AOCI or AOCL are not included in stockholders’ equity for purposes of determining our capital for bank regulatory purposes.\nTotal stockholders’ equity was $924.3 million as of June 30, 2025, an increase of $33.8 million, or 3.8%, compared to $890.5 million as of December 31, 2024. This increase was primarily driven by: (i) a net income of $35.0 million in the first six months of 2025, and (ii) $14.4 million of other comprehensive income in the first half of 2025. This was partially offset by: (i) an aggregate of $10.0 million of Class A common stock repurchased in the first six months of 2025, and (ii) $7.7 million of dividends declared and paid by the Company in the first six months of 2025.\n105\nCommon Stock Transactions\nIn the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2025, the Company repurchased an aggregate of 275,666 and 491,093 shares, respectively, of Class A common stock at a weighted average price of $18.14 and $20.36 per share at those , under the 2023 Class A Common Stock Repurchase Program. The aggregate purchase price for these transactions was $5.0 million and $10.0 million in the three and six months ended June 30, 2025, including transaction costs.\nDividends\nSet forth below are the details of dividends declared and paid by the Company for the first six months ended June 30, 2025:\nDeclaration Date\nRecord Date\nPayment Date\nDividend Per Share\nDividend Amount\n04/23/2025\n05/15/2025\n05/30/2025\n$0.09\n$3.9 million\n01/22/2025\n02/14/2025\n02/28/2025\n$0.09\n$3.8 million\nOn July 23, 2025, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.09 per share of the Company’s common stock. The dividend is payable on August 29, 2025, to shareholders of record at the close of business on August 15, 2025.\nLiquidity Management\nWe manage our liquidity based on several factors that include the amount of core deposit relationships as a percentage of total deposits, the level of diversification of our funding sources, the allocation and amount of our deposits among deposit types, the short-term funding sources used to fund assets, the amount of non-deposit funding used to fund assets, the availability of unused funding sources, off-balance sheet obligations, the amount of cash and liquid securities we hold, the availability of assets readily convertible into cash without undue loss, the characteristics and maturities of our assets when compared to the characteristics of our liabilities and other factors.\n\nLiquidity risk management is a relevant element of our asset/liability management. Our contingency funding plan is constantly monitored by our Assets and Liabilities Committee and serves as the basis to identify our liquidity needs. The contingency funding plan models several liquidity stress scenarios to evaluate different potential liquidity outflows or funding gaps resulting from economic disruptions and volatility in the financial markets, among other factors.\nCustomer deposits have been our principal source of funding, supplemented by our investment securities portfolio, our short-term and long-term borrowings as well as loan repayments and amortizations.\n\nThe Company’s liquidity position includes cash and cash equivalents of $636.8 million at June 30, 2025, compared to $590.4 million at December 31, 2024.\nAt June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the Company had $765.0 million and $745.0 million, respectively, of outstanding advances from the FHLB. At June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, we had an additional $1.9 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, of remaining borrowing capacity with the FHLB. This additional borrowing capacity is determined by the FHLB. In the six months ended June 30, 2025, the Company borrowed $50.0 million and repaid $30.0 million in advances from the FHLB. In the six months ended June 30, 2025, the Company had no significant gains or losses on the repayments of the advances from the FHLB. These repayments are part of the Company’s asset/liability management strategies.\n106\nThere were no other borrowings as of June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024.\nWe also have available uncommitted federal funds lines with several banks. We had no outstanding borrowings under uncommitted federal funds lines with banks at June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024.\nHolding Company\nWe are a corporation separate and apart from the Bank and, therefore, must provide for our own liquidity. Historically, our main source of funding has been dividends declared and paid to us by the Bank. The Company is the obligor and guarantor on our junior subordinated debt and the guarantor of the Subordinated Notes.\nThe Company held cash and cash equivalents mainly at the Bank of $11.6 million as of June 30, 2025 in funds available to service Subordinated Notes and junior subordinated debt and for general corporate purposes, as a separate stand-alone entity ($99.5 million as of December 31, 2024 in funds available to service Subordinated Notes, Senior Notes and junior subordinated debt and for general corporate purposes).\nOn April 1, 2025, the Company redeemed $60.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 5.75% Senior Notes that were due June 30, 2025. The Notes were redeemed in full at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The aggregate redemption price, including accrued interest, totaled approximately $60.9 million.\nSubsidiary Dividends\nThere are statutory and regulatory limitations that affect the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to the Company. These limitations exclude the effects of AOCI/AOCL. Management believes that these limitations will not affect the Company’s ability to meet its ongoing short-term cash obligations. See “Supervision and Regulation” in the 2024 Form 10-K.\nIn July 2025, the Board of Directors of the Bank approved the payment of a cash dividend of $40.0 million by the Bank to the Company.\nBased on our current outlook, we believe that net income, advances from the FHLB, available other borrowings and any dividends paid to us by the Bank will be sufficient to fund liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future.\n107\nRegulatory Capital Requirements\nThe Company’s consolidated regulatory capital amounts and ratios are presented in the following table:\nActual\nRequired for Capital Adequacy Purposes\nRegulatory Minimums To be Well Capitalized\n(in thousands, except percentages)\nAmount\nRatio\nAmount\nRatio\nAmount\nRatio\nJune 30, 2025\nTotal capital ratio\n$\n1,122,133\n13.49\n%\n$\n665,638\n8.00\n%\n$\n832,048\n10.00\n%\nTier 1 capital ratio\n996,261\n11.97\n%\n499,229\n6.00\n%\n665,638\n8.00\n%\nTier 1 leverage ratio\n996,261\n9.69\n%\n411,425\n4.00\n%\n514,281\n5.00\n%\nCommon Equity Tier 1 (CET1)\n935,614\n11.24\n%\n374,422\n4.50\n%\n540,831\n6.50\n%\nDecember 31, 2024\nTotal capital ratio\n$\n1,096,882\n13.43\n%\n$\n653,446\n8.00\n%\n$\n816,807\n10.00\n%\nTier 1 capital ratio\n976,360\n11.95\n%\n490,084\n6.00\n%\n653,446\n8.00\n%\nTier 1 leverage ratio\n976,360\n9.66\n%\n404,480\n4.00\n%\n505,600\n5.00\n%\nCommon Equity Tier 1 (CET1)\n915,658\n11.21\n%\n367,563\n4.50\n%\n530,925\n6.50\n%\nThe Bank’s consolidated regulatory capital amounts and ratios are presented in the following table:\nActual\nRequired for Capital Adequacy Purposes\nRegulatory Minimums to be Well Capitalized\n(in thousands, except percentages)\nAmount\nRatio\nAmount\nRatio\nAmount\nRatio\nJune 30, 2025\nTotal capital ratio\n$\n1,095,603\n13.19\n%\n$\n664,467\n8.00\n%\n$\n830,584\n10.00\n%\nTier 1 capital ratio\n999,441\n12.03\n%\n498,351\n6.00\n%\n664,467\n8.00\n%\nTier 1 leverage ratio\n999,441\n9.76\n%\n409,627\n4.00\n%\n512,033\n5.00\n%\nCommon Equity Tier 1 (CET1)\n999,441\n12.03\n%\n373,763\n4.50\n%\n539,880\n6.50\n%\nDecember 31, 2024\nTotal capital ratio\n$\n1,047,759\n12.84\n%\n$\n645,644\n8.00\n%\n$\n815,805\n10.00\n%\nTier 1 capital ratio\n956,861\n11.73\n%\n489,483\n6.00\n%\n652,644\n8.00\n%\nTier 1 leverage ratio\n956,861\n9.50\n%\n402,892\n4.00\n%\n503,615\n5.00\n%\nCommon Equity Tier 1 (CET1)\n956,861\n11.73\n%\n367,112\n4.50\n%\n530,273\n6.50\n%\n108\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe following table shows the outstanding balance of financial instruments whose contracts represent off-balance sheet credit risk as of the end of the periods presented. Except as disclosed below, we are not involved in any other off-balance sheet contractual relationships that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, a change in our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

Significant commitments for future cash obligations include capital expenditures related to operating leases, certain binding agreements we have entered into for services including outsourcing of technology services, advertising and other services, and other borrowing arrangements which are not material to our liquidity needs. We currently anticipate that our available funds, credit facilities, and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our operational cash needs for the foreseeable future. Other than the changes discussed herein, there have been no material changes to the contractual obligations previously disclosed in the 2024 Form 10-K.\nIn the six months ended June 30, 2025, the Company redeemed $60.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 5.75% senior notes that were due June 30, 2025.\nIn the six months ended June 30, 2025, the Company borrowed $50.0 million and repaid $30.0 million of FHLB advances.\nIn the six months ended June 30, 2025, total time deposits decreased $71.5 million, or 3.2%.\nSee\n “Deposits” for additional information.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nFor our critical accounting policies and estimates disclosure,\nsee\n the 2024 Form 10-K where such matters are disclosed for the Company’s latest fiscal year ended December 31, 2024.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements.\nFor a description of recently issued accounting pronouncements,\nsee\n Note 1 to the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements in the 2024 Form 10-K."
