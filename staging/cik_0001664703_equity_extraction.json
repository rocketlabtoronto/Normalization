Our Energy Server systems utilize innovative fuel cell technology and provide efficient energy generation with reduced operating costs and lower greenhouse gas emissions as compared to conventional fossil fuel generation. The solid oxide platform that powers our fuel cells can be used to create hydrogen with our Bloom Electrolyzer. In addition, the Energy Server systems allow us to provide energy solutions for customers, as our products are designed to work with existing carbon capture utilization and storage (“CCUS”) and combined heat and power (“CHP”) technologies. By generating power where it is consumed, our energy producing systems offer increased electrical reliability and improved energy security, while providing a path to energy independence. Our corporate headquarters are located in San Jose, California.\nLiquidity\nWhile we have generally incurred operating losses and negative cash flows from operations since our inception, we generated $\n92.0\n million of positive cash flows from operations in fiscal year 2024. With the series of new debt offerings, debt extinguishments, and conversions to equit\ny that we completed since 2021\n, we had $\n1,124.7\n million and $\n4.1\n million of total outstanding recourse and non-recourse debt, respectively, as of December 31, 2024, $\n114.4\n million and $\n1,014.4\n million of which was classified as short-term debt and long-term debt, respectively.\nOn October 23, 2021, we entered into the Securities Purchase Agreement (the “SPA”) with SK ecoplant Co., Ltd. (“SK ecoplant”, formerly known as SK Engineering & Construction Co., Ltd.) in connection with a strategic partnership. For more information on the strategic investment with SK ecoplant, please see Note 17 — \nSK ecoplant Strategic Investment\n and Note 11 — \nRelated Party Transactions\n.\nOn August 19, 2022, we completed an underwritten public offering (the “Offering”), pursuant to which we issued and sold \n13,000,000\n shares of Class A common stock at the price of $\n26.00\n per share. As a part of the Offering, the underwriters were provided a \n30\n-day option to purchase an additional \n1,950,000\n shares of our Class A common stock at the same price, less underwriting discounts and commissions, which was exercised contemporaneously with the Offering. The aggregate net proceeds received by us from the Offering were $\n371.5\n million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $\n16.5\n million and incremental costs directly attributable to the Offering of $\n0.7\n million.\nOn May 29, 2024, we issued the \n3\n% Green Convertible Senior Notes (the “\n3\n% Green Notes due June 2029”) in an aggregate principal amount of $\n402.5\n million due June 2029, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted, resulting in net cash proceeds of $\n389.7\n million. On May 29, 2024, we used approximately $\n141.8\n million of the net cash proceeds from this issuance to repurchase $\n115.0\n million, or \n50\n%, of the outstanding principal amount of our \n2.5\n% Green Convertible Senior Notes due August 2025 (the “\n2.5\n% Green Notes”) in privately negotiated transactions. The repurchase amount equaled \n122.6\n% of the principal amount repurchased, plus related accrued and unpaid interest. For more information on our recourse and non-recourse debt and purchase of Capped Calls, please see Note 7 — \nOutstanding Loans and Security Agreements.\nOur future capital requirements depend on many factors, including our rate of revenue growth, the timing and extent of spending on research and development efforts and other business initiatives, the rate of growth in the volume of system builds and the need for additional working capital, the expansion of sales and marketing activities both in domestic and international markets, market acceptance of our products, our ability to secure financing for customer use of our products, the timing of installations and of inventory build in anticipation of future sales and installations, and overall economic conditions. In order to support and achieve our future growth plans, we may need or seek advantageously to obtain additional funding through equity or\n debt financing. \nFailure to obtain this financing on favorable terms or at all in future quarters may affect our financial position and results of operations, including our revenues and cash flows.\nIn the opinion of management, the combination of our cash and cash equivalents and cash flow to be generated by our operations is expected to be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash flow needs for at least the next 12 months from the date of issuance of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n 86\nInflation Reduction Act of 2022\nOn August 16, 2022, President Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IRA”). It contains provisions that have had a significant impact on the development and financing of clean energy projects in the U.S. \nHowever, President Trump has expressed skepticism about the IRA and clean energy projects, thus creating uncertainty about its future. \nThe IRA includes expanded tax credits for projects across the Bloom product portfolio as well as for manufacturing of clean energy equipment. It also introduces new mechanisms for tax credit monetization and transferability. The IRA includes targeted incentives intended to encourage development in low-income communities, the use of domestically produced materials, and compliance with certain labor-related requirements. We believe that the programs and credits included in the IRA align well with our business model and could provide significant benefits for our projects.\nThe IRA introduces and updates several crediting mechanisms and incentive provisions that are relevant for us including:\n•\nSection 48E \n—\n Clean Electricity Investment Credit, which starting December 31, 2024, replaces the previous investment tax credit framework for named clean energy technologies with a “tech neutral” framework anchored around the net carbon neutrality of energy generation from qualifying facilities. It provides incentives of up to 50% for qualifying energy property meeting domestic content and labor requirements. \n•\nSection 45V \n—\n Credit for the Production of Clean Hydrogen, which provides a Production Tax Credit (the “PTC”) of up to $3 per kg of qualified clean hydrogen produced at qualified facilities in the US, including Bloom’s Electrolyzer projects. Bloom is also positioned to provide near-zero carbon power to natural gas based low carbon hydrogen facilities.\n•\nSection 45Q \n—\n Credit for Carbon Oxide Sequestration, which provides up to a $60/tonne credit for carbon utilization and $85/tonne credit for geologic sequestration and can improve the cost effectiveness of Bloom’s carbon capture offerings.\n•\nSection 45Z \n—\n Clean Fuel Production Credit, which provides a tax credit for the production of clean transportation fuels with lifecycle GHG emissions below certain levels. The credit can reach levels of up to $1.00/gallon for non-aviation fuel and $1.75/gallon for non-aviation fuel and is influenced by emissions associated with energy use including on-site power provided by Bloom. \n•\nSection 48C \n—\n Qualified Advanced Energy Project, which provides an Investment Tax Credit (the “ITC”) through a competitive application process administered through the Department of Energy equal to 6% or 30% of the investment with respect to advanced energy projects\nWe believe that the programs and credits included in the IRA align well with our business model and could provide significant benefits with respect to incentivizing the purchase of our current product offerings and technologies. In particular, the IRA authorized a competitive process to apply for credits to expand or enhance manufacturing capacity under IRC 48C. On December 21, 2023, we submitted the application for qualifying advanced energy project credit allocation under Internal Revenue Code Section 48C(e) for the manufacturing facility in Fremont, California (the “Facility”). On March 29, 2024, we received notification from the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) of the acceptance of our application for a Qualifying Advanced Energy Project Credit of up to $\n75.3\n million. After a technical review of Bloom’s Section 48C(e) application, the Department of Energy provided a recommendation to the IRS to grant a $\n75.3\n million credit allocation for the Facility. The approval is subject to satisfaction of the underlying certification requirements, including the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements, within two years from the date of the application acceptance \nand potential clearance by the Office of Management and Budget due to President Trump’s executive order halting the disbursement of funds under the IRA.\nThe U.S. Treasury Department has issued implementation guidance, and we intend to engage with the new U.S. federal administration to understand how shifting policy priorities might impact the revised guidance or changes to the law itself. Current Section 48E guidance places Bloom Energy Server systems running on natural gas in a class of Combustion and Gasification facilities required to demonstrate net-zero emissions in the production of electricity. If the U.S. federal administration does not clarify key aspects of the guidance related to our unique technology, our projects will no longer be beneficiaries of the ITC. If the ITC is not extended for fuel cells, U.S. bookings, revenue and gross margins could be materially impacted in 2025 and beyond. Also, it is possible that the expiration of the ITC may have increased demand for ITC-compliant sales of our Energy Server systems in 2024 due to customer desire to secure ITC for their projects through safe harboring. However, if our customers or project-level investors prove reluctant to make sufficient cash outlays for purchases of Energy Server systems for future projects, our sales could be negatively impacted in future years.\n 87\nAlso, the PTC for qualified clean hydrogen and credit for carbon capture could result in increased demand for commercial solutions to hydrogen production technology and carbon capture, including our solid oxide fuel cell-based products.\nAt the time of IRA implementation in August 2022, some of our existing contracts contemplated price adjustments at the inception of the contract for the change in the ITC rate to 30%. As a result, we recognized $\n8.7\n million in product revenue and $\n1.3\n million in installation revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022, from such existing contracts, as a change in variable consideration estimate for Energy Server systems placed in service during the eligible periods under the IRA and which qualified for the 30% ITC rate. In fiscal years 2024 and 2023, all of our contract prices included the impact of the 30% ITC rate under the IRA provisions.\nThe IRA also creates certain bonus tax credits relevant to our products placed in service in fiscal years 2024 and 2023, available by satisfying domestic content criteria and/or other criteria if such products are located within an “energy community,” as defined by the IRA. In fiscal years 2024 and 2023 contracts that included price adjustments related to the domestic content bonus tax credit were evaluated as variable consideration and we estimated variable consideration by using the most likely amount method of meeting the IRA domestic content criteria. When recognizing revenue, we constrained the estimate of variable consideration to an amount that was not probable of a significant revenue reversal.\nBasis of Presentation \nWe have prepared the consolidated financial statements included herein pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), and as permitted by those rules, including all disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles as applied in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”). Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThese consolidated financial statements reflect our accounts and operations and those of our subsidiaries in which we have a controlling financial interest. We use a qualitative approach in assessing the consolidation requirement for our variable interest entities (“VIEs”), which we refer to as tax equity partnerships (each such VIE, also referred to as our power purchase agreement, or PPA Entities) and a joint venture in the Republic of Korea (the “Korean JV”). This approach focuses on determining whether we have the power to direct those activities of the PPA Entities and the Korean JV that most significantly affect their economic performance and whether we have the obligation to absorb losses, or the right to receive benefits, which could potentially be significant to the PPA Entities and the Korean JV. For all periods presented, we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary in all of our operational PPA Entities and the Korean JV, as discussed in Note 10 — \nPortfolio Financings\n\nand Note 17\n — SK ecoplant Strategic Investment\n, respectively. We evaluate our relationships with the PPA Entities and the Korean JV on an ongoing basis to ensure that we continue to be the primary beneficiary. In August 2023, we sold our last consolidated PPA Entity, 2015 ESA Project Company, LLC (“PPA V”), as a result of the PPA V Repowering of the Energy Server systems (see Note 10 — \nPortfolio Financings\n). All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated upon consolidation.\nThe sale of an operating company with a portfolio of the PPAs in which we do not have an equity interest is called a “Third-Party PPA.” We have determined that, although these entities are VIEs, we do not have the power to direct those activities of the Third-Party PPAs that most significantly affect their economic performance. We also do not have the obligation to absorb losses, or the right to receive benefits, which could potentially be significant to the Third-Party PPAs. Because we are not the primary beneficiary of these activities, we do not consolidate Third-Party PPAs.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. The most significant estimates include the determination of the stand-alone selling price, valuation of financial instruments associated with the Amended SPA with SK ecoplant, inventory valuation, specifically excess and obsolescence provisions for obsolete or unsellable inventory and, in relation to property, plant and equipment (specifically Energy Server systems), assumptions relating to economic useful lives and impairment assessments. \nOther accounting estimates include variable consideration relating to product performance guaranties, lease and non-lease components and related financing obligations such as incremental borrowing rates, estimated output, efficiency and residual value of our products, product performance warranties and guaranties and extended maintenance, derivative valuations, \n 88\nestimates relating to contractual indemnities provisions, estimates for income taxes and deferred tax asset valuation allowances, stock-based compensation expense, estimates of fair value of preferred stock and equity and non-equity items in relation to the SK ecoplant strategic investment, and financing obligation allocations in managed service transactions. In addition, certain of such estimates could require further judgment or modification and therefore carry a higher degree of variability and volatility. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions.\nConcentration of Risk\nGeographic Risk — \nThe majority of our revenue and long-lived assets are attributable to operations in the U.S. for all periods presented. In addition to shipments in the U.S., we also ship our products to other countries, primarily to the Republic of Korea, Japan, India, and Taiwan (collectively referred to as the “Asia Pacific region”). In the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, total revenue in the U.S. was \n74\n%, \n70\n% and \n56\n%, respectively, of our total revenue.\nCredit Risk — \nAt December 31, 2024, three customers, the first of which is our related party (see Note 11 — \nRelated Party Transactions\n), accounted for approximately \n28\n%, \n28\n%, and \n20\n% of accounts receivable. At December 31, 2023, one customer, who is our related party, accounted for approximately \n74\n% of accounts receivable. To date, we have not experienced any material credit losses from these customers.\nCustomer Risk — \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, revenue from three customers, the first of which is our related party (see Note 11 — \nRelated Party Transactions\n), accounted for approximately \n23\n%, \n16\n% and \n14\n% of our total revenue. During the year ended December 31, 2023, two customers, the first of which is our related party, represented approximately \n37\n% and \n26\n% of our total revenue. In the year ended December 31, 2022, revenue from two customers, the first of which is our related party, accounted for approximately \n38\n% and \n37\n% of our total revenue.\n2. \nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\nRevenue Recognition\nWe primarily earn product and installation revenue from the sale and installation of our Energy Server systems and other products, service revenue by providing services under operations and maintenance services contracts, and electricity revenue by selling electricity to customers under PPAs and Managed Services Agreements. We offer our customers several ways to finance their use of our Energy Server systems. Customers, including some of our international channel providers and the Third-Party PPAs, may choose to purchase our Energy Server systems outright. Customers may also enter into contracts with us for the purchase of electricity generated by our Energy Server systems (i.e., Managed Services Agreements), which is then financed through one of our financing partners (i.e., Managed Services Financings). Finally, customers may purchase electricity through our PPA Entities (i.e., Portfolio Financings). For additional information, please see Part I, Item 7, Section \nPurchase and Financing Options\n.\nRevenue Recognition under ASC 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers\nIn applying Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606 revenue is recognized by following a five-step process:\n1.\nIdentify the contract(s) with a customer.\n Evidence of a contract generally consists of an agreement, or a purchase order issued pursuant to the terms and conditions of a distributor, reseller, purchase, use and maintenance agreement, maintenance services agreements or energy supply agreement.\n2.\nIdentify the performance obligations in the contract.\n Performance obligations are identified in our contracts and primarily include transferring control of our products, installation of the Energy Server systems, providing maintenance services and maintenance services renewal options which, in certain situations, provide customers with material rights.\n3.\nDetermine the transaction price.\n The purchase price stated in an agreed-upon purchase order or contract is generally representative of the transaction price. When determining the transaction price, we consider the effects of any variable consideration, which include performance guarantees that may be payable to our customers.\n4.\nAllocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract.\n The transaction price in a contract is allocated based upon the relative standalone selling price of each distinct performance obligation identified in the contract.\n 89\n5.\nRecognize revenue when (or as) we satisfy a performance obligation.\n We satisfy performance obligations either over time or at a point in time as discussed in further detail below. Revenue is recognized at the time the related performance obligation is satisfied by transferring control of the promised products or services to a customer.\nWe sometimes combine contracts governing the sale and installation of our Energy Server systems with the related maintenance services contracts and account for them as a single contract at contract inception to the extent the contracts are with the same customer. These contracts are not combined when the customer for the sale and installation of the Energy Server systems is different to the maintenance services contract customer. We also assess whether any contract terms including default provisions, put or call options result in components of our contracts being accounted for as financing or leasing transactions outside of the scope of ASC 606\n.\nMost of our contracts contain performance obligations with a combination of our products, installation and maintenance services. For these performance obligations, we allocate the total transaction price to each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling price. Our maintenance services contracts are typically subject to renewal by customers on an annual basis. We assess these maintenance services renewal options at contract inception to determine whether they provide customers with material rights that give rise to separate performance obligations.\nThe total transaction price is determined based on the total consideration specified in the contract, including variable consideration in the form of a performance guaranty payment that represents potential amounts payable to customers. The expected value method is generally used when estimating variable consideration, which typically reduces the total transaction price due to the nature of the performance obligations to which the variable consideration relates. These estimates reflect our historical experience and current contractual requirements which cap the maximum amount that may be paid. The expected value method requires judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation. Depending on the facts and circumstances, a change in variable consideration estimate will either be accounted for at the contract level or using the portfolio method. \nWe exclude from the transaction price all taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are both (i) imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction and (ii) collected from customers. Accordingly, such tax amounts are not included as a component of net sales or cost of sales. These tax amounts are recorded in the cost of electricity revenue, cost of service revenue, and general and administrative operating expenses.\nWe allocate the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation based on relative stand-alone selling prices. Given that we typically sell our products together with the related installation and maintenance services, standalone selling prices are not directly observable. We estimate standalone selling prices by using a cost-plus approach. Costs relating to our products include all direct and indirect manufacturing costs, applicable overhead costs and costs for normal production inefficiencies (i.e., variances). We then apply a margin to our products based on our Company’s pricing strategy. As our business offerings and eligibility for the ITC evolve over time, we may be required to modify the expected margin in subsequent periods and our revenue could be materially affected. Costs relating to installation include all direct and indirect installation costs. The margin we apply reflects our profit objectives relating to installation. Costs for maintenance services arrangements are estimated over the life of the maintenance contracts and include estimated future material costs and non-material costs. Material costs over the period of the service arrangement are impacted significantly by the longevity of the fuel cells themselves. We apply a lower margin to our total service costs than to our products as it best reflects our long-term service margin expectations and comparable historical industry service margins. \nWe generally recognize product and installation revenue at a point in time that our customers obtain control of our products. For certain instances, control of the installations is transferred to the customers over time, and the related revenue is recognized over time as the performance obligation is satisfied using the cost-to-cost (percentage-of-completion) method. We use an input measure of progress to determine the amount of revenue to be recognized during each reporting period. We recognize maintenance services revenue, including revenue associated with any related customer material rights, over time as we perform service maintenance activities.\nAmounts billed to our customers for shipping and handling activities are considered contract fulfillment activities and not a separate performance obligation of the contract. Shipping and handling costs are recorded within the cost of revenue.\nThe following is a description of the principal activities from which we generate revenue. Our four revenue streams are classified as follows:\nProduct Revenue — \nAll of our product revenue is generated from the sale of our products to direct purchase customers, including financing partners on the Third-Party PPAs and sale-and-leaseback transactions, and international channel providers. \n 90\nWe generally recognize product revenue from contracts with customers at the point that control is transferred to the customers. This occurs when we achieve customer acceptance, which depending on the contract terms is when the product is shipped and delivered to our customers, when the product is shipped and delivered and is physically ready for startup and commissioning (i.e., Mechanical Completion), or when the product is shipped and delivered and is turned on and operational (i.e., Commencement of Operations or “COO”), if required.\nUnder our traditional lease financing option, we sell our Energy Server systems through a direct sale to a financing partner who, in turn, lease the Energy Server systems to the customer under a lease agreement. With our sales to our international channel providers, our international channel providers typically sell the Energy Server systems to, or sometimes provide a PPA to, an end customer. In both traditional lease and international channel providers’ transactions, we contract directly with the end customer to provide extended maintenance services after the end of the standard warranty period. As a result, since the customer that purchases the server is a different and unrelated party to the customer that purchases extended warranty services, the product and maintenance services contract are not combined.\nInstallation Revenue — \nNearly all of our installation revenue relates to the installation of the Energy Server systems sold to the customers as part of a direct purchase and to financing parties as part of a traditional lease or Portfolio Financings. Generally, we recognize installation revenue when the product is physically ready for startup and commissioning (i.e., Mechanical Completion), or when the product is turned on and operational (i.e., COO). For instances when control for installation services is transferred over time, we use an input measure of progress to determine the amount of revenue to recognize during each reporting period based on the costs incurred to satisfy the performance obligation.\nPayments received from customers are recorded within deferred revenue and customer deposits in the consolidated balance sheets until control is transferred. The related cost of such product and installation is also deferred as a component of deferred cost of revenue in the consolidated balance sheets until control is transferred.\nService Revenue — \nService revenue is generated from operations and maintenance agreements (“O&M Agreements”). As part of the first year of O&M services, we also monitor the operations of the underlying products and provide output and efficiency warranties and guaranties. We have determined that this standard first-year O&M services (including the warranties and guaranties) is a distinct performance obligation — being a promise to stand-ready to maintain our products when and if required during the first year following installation. We also sell to our customers extended annual maintenance services that effectively extend the standard first-year warranty coverage at the customer’s option. These customers generally have an option to renew or cancel the extended maintenance services on an annual basis and nearly every customer has renewed historically. Similar to the standard first-year O&M services, the optional extended annual maintenance services are considered a distinct performance obligation – being a promise to stand-ready to maintain the products when and if required during the renewal service year. \nGiven our customers’ renewal history, we anticipate that most of them will continue to renew their maintenance services agreements each year for the period of their expected use of the products. The contractual renewal price may be less than the stand-alone selling price of the maintenance services and consequently the contract renewal option may provide the customer with a material right. We estimate the standalone selling price for customer renewal options that give rise to material rights using the practical alternative by reference to optional maintenance services renewal periods expected to be provided and the corresponding expected consideration for these services. This reflects the fact that our additional performance obligations in any contractual renewal period are consistent with the services provided under the standard first-year warranty. Where we have determined that the customers have material rights as a result of their contract renewal option, we recognize that portion of the transaction price allocated to the material rights over the period in which such rights are exercised. \nPayments from customers for the extended maintenance contracts are generally received at the beginning of each service year. Accordingly, the customer payment received is recorded as a customer deposit and revenue is recognized over the related service period as the services are performed. \nElectricity Revenue — \nWe sell electricity produced by Energy Server systems owned directly by us. Before the sale in August 2023 of our last consolidated PPA Entity, PPA V, we also were selling electricity produced by our Energy Server systems owned by our consolidated PPA Entities. Our PPA Entities purchased the Energy Server systems from us and sold electricity produced by these systems to customers through long-term PPAs. Customers were required to purchase all of the electricity produced by those Energy Server systems at agreed-upon rates over the course of the PPAs’ contractual term.\nIn addition, in certain Managed Services Financings pursuant to which we are party to a Managed Services Agreement with a customer in a sale-leaseback-sublease arrangement, we may recognize electricity revenue. We first determine whether the Energy Server systems under the sale-leaseback arrangement of a Managed Services Financing were “integral equipment.” \n 91\nAs the Energy Server systems were determined not to be integral equipment, we determined if the leaseback was classified as a financing lease or an operating lease.\nStarting in the second half of fiscal year 2021, we completed several successful sale-and-leaseback transactions in which we transferred control of the Energy Server system to the financier and leased it back as an operating lease to provide electricity to the end customer.\nIn order for the transaction to meet the criteria for successful sale-leaseback accounting, control of the Energy Server systems must transfer to the financier, which requires, among other criteria, the leaseback to meet the criteria for an operating lease in accordance with ASC 842, \nLeases\n (“ASC 842”). Accordingly, for such transactions where control transfers and the leaseback is classified as an operating lease, the proceeds from the sale to the financier are recognized as revenue based on the fair value of the Energy Server systems sold and are allocated between product revenue and installation revenue based on the relative standalone selling prices.\nWe recognize an operating lease liability for the Energy Server systems leaseback obligation based on the present value of the future payments to the financier that are attributed to the Energy Server systems leaseback using our incremental borrowing rate (“IBR”). We also record an operating lease right-of-use asset, which is amortized over the term of the leaseback, and is included as a cost of electricity revenue on the consolidated statements of operations.\nFor certain sale-and-leaseback transactions, we receive proceeds from the financier in excess of the fair value of the Energy Server systems in order to finance our ongoing costs associated with the operation of the Energy Server systems during the term of the end customer agreement to provide electricity. Such proceeds are recognized as financing obligations.\nWe allocate payments we are obligated to make under the leaseback agreement with the financier between the operating lease liability and the financing obligation based on the proportion of the financing obligation to the total proceeds to be received.\nWe recognize revenue from the satisfaction of performance obligations under our PPAs and Managed Services Financings to provide electricity to our end customers as the electricity is provided over the term of the agreement in the amount invoiced, which reflects the amount of consideration to which we have the right to invoice, and which corresponds to the value transferred under such arrangements.\nModifications\nContract modifications are accounted for as separate contracts if the additional products and services are distinct and priced at stand-alone selling prices. If the additional products and services are distinct, but not priced at standalone selling prices, the modification is treated as a termination of the existing contract and the creation of a new contract. If the additional products and services are not distinct within the context of the contract, the modification is combined with the original contract and either an increase or decrease in revenue is recognized on the modification date. \nDeferred Revenue\nWe recognize a contract liability (referred to as deferred revenue in our consolidated financial statements, excluding customer deposits) when we have an obligation to transfer products or services to a customer in advance of us satisfying a performance obligation and the contract liability is reduced as performance obligations are satisfied and revenue is recognized. The related costs are deferred as a component of deferred cost of revenue in the consolidated balance sheets. Prior to shipment of the product or the commencement of performance of maintenance services, any prepayment made by the customer is recorded as a customer deposit. Deferred revenue related to material rights for options to renew are recognized in revenue over the maintenance services period.\nA description of the principal activities from which we recognize the cost of revenues associated with each of our revenue streams are classified as follows:\nCost of Product Revenue — \nCost of product revenue consists of costs of our products that we sell to direct purchase, including financing partners on the Third-Party PPAs, international channel providers and traditional lease customers. It includes costs paid to our materials suppliers, direct labor, manufacturing and other overhead costs, shipping costs, provisions for excess and obsolete inventory and the depreciation costs of our equipment. For the Energy Server systems sold to customers pending installation, we provide warranty reserves as a part of product costs for the period from transfer of control of the Energy Server systems to the earlier of one year or Commencement of Operations.\n 92\nCost of Installation Revenue — \nCost of installation revenue primarily consists of the costs to install our Energy Server systems that we sell to direct purchase, including financing partners on the Third-Party PPAs and traditional lease and successful sale-leaseback customers. It includes the cost of materials and service providers, personnel costs, shipping costs and allocated costs.\nCost of Service Revenue — \nCost of service revenue consists of costs incurred under maintenance service contracts for all customers. It includes the cost of field replacement units, personnel costs for our customer support organization, certain allocated costs, and extended maintenance-related product repair and replacement costs.\nCost of Electricity Revenue — \nCost of electricity revenue primarily consists of the depreciation of the cost of the Energy Server systems owned by us or the consolidated PPA Entities. The cost of electricity revenue is generally recognized over the term of the Managed Services Agreement or customer’s PPA contract. In August 2023, we sold our last consolidated PPA Entity, PPA V.\nRevenue Recognized from Portfolio Financings Through the PPA Entities \n(See Note 10 — \nPortfolio Financings\n)\nIn 2010, we began selling our Energy Server systems to tax equity partnerships in which we held an equity interest as a managing member, or a PPA Entity. The investors in a PPA Entity contribute cash to the PPA Entity in exchange for an equity interest, which then allows the PPA Entity to purchase the Operating Company and the Energy Server systems. \nThe cash contributions held are classified as short-term or long-term restricted cash according to the terms of each PPA Entity’s governing documents. As we identified customers, the Operating Company entered into a PPA with the customer pursuant to which the customer agreed to purchase the power generated by one or more Energy Server systems at a specified rate per kilowatt hour for a specified term, which can range from \n10\n to \n21\n years. The Operating Company, wholly owned by the PPA Entity, typically entered into a maintenance services agreement with us following the first year of service to extend the standard one-year performance warranties and guaranties. This intercompany arrangement is eliminated on consolidation. Those PPAs that qualify as leases are classified as either sales-type leases or operating leases and those that do not qualify as leases are classified as tariff agreements or revenue arrangements with customers. For arrangements classified as operating leases, tariff agreements, or revenue arrangements with customers, income is recognized as contractual amounts are due when the electricity is generated and presented within electricity revenue on the consolidated statements of operations.\nIn August 2023, we sold our last consolidated PPA Entity, PPA V. Please refer to Note 10 — \nPortfolio Financings\n for details. \nSales-type Leases — \nCertain Portfolio Financings with the PPA Entities entered into prior to our adoption of ASC 842 qualified as sales-type leases in accordance with ASC 840, \nLeases\n (“ASC 840”). The classification for such arrangements were carried over and accounted for as sales-type leases under ASC 842.\nIn the fiscal year 2022 we sold PPA IIIa. Please refer to Note 10 — \nPortfolio Financings\n for details. \nWe have not entered into any new Portfolio Financing arrangements through\n the PPA Entities during the last four years. \nOperating Leases — \nCertain Portfolio Financings with the PPA Entities entered into prior to the adoption of ASC 842 that were deemed leases in substance but did not meet the criteria of sales-type leases or direct financing leases in accordance with ASC 840, were accounted for as operating leases. The classification for such arrangements was carried over and accounted for as operating leases under ASC 842. Revenue under these arrangements was recognized as electricity sales and service revenue and was provided to the customer at rates specified under the PPAs.\n During the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022, revenue from electricity sales from these Portfolio Financings with the PPA Entities amounted to $\n14.3\n million and $\n25.9\n million, respectively. There was \nno\n revenue from electricity sales from the Portfolio Financings with the PPA Entities during the year ended December 31, 2024. During the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022, service revenue from operating leases amounted to $\n3.1\n million, and $\n13.1\n million, respectively. There was \nno\n service revenue from operating leases during the year ended December 31, 2024. Service revenue related to sales-type leases was immaterial for the year ended December 31, 2022. There was no service revenue related to sales-type leases for the years ended December 31, 2024, and 2023.\nInvestment Tax Credits — \nUnder our Portfolio Financings with PPA Entities, ITCs were primarily passed through to Equity Investors with approximately \n1\n% to \n10\n% of incentives received by us. These incentives were accounted for by using the flow-through method.\nThe ITC program has operational criteria for the first \nfive years\n after the qualified equipment is placed in service. If the qualified energy property is disposed of or otherwise ceases to be investment credit property before the close of the five-year \n 93\nrecapture period is fulfilled, it could result in a partial reduction of the federal tax incentives. \nNo\n recapture occurred during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\nIn August 2022, the IRA was signed into law. The IRA includes numerous investments in climate protection, among them the extension and expansion of the ITC and the PTC, the addition of expanded tax credits for other technologies and for manufacturing clean energy equipment, as well as terms allowing parties to more easily monetize the tax credits. The IRA contains a two-tiered credit-amount structure for many applicable tax credits. Specifically, many of the credits have a lower base credit amount that can be increased up to five times if the taxpayer can satisfy applicable prevailing wage or apprenticeship requirements. The IRA also creates certain bonus tax credit amounts relevant to Bloom products placed in service in 2023 and 2024, available by satisfying domestic content criteria and/or locating within an “energy community,” as defined by the IRA. The IRA also creates tax credits for the production of hydrogen and carbon capture.\nOn August 16, 2022, the IRA enacted provisions to enable our Energy Server systems to be qualified for 30% or more ITCs. If a contract consideration subject to changes due to the underlying ITC rate assumption changes, we will consider such potential ITC benefit changes as a variable consideration and will generally estimate the variable consideration by using the most likely amount method. When recognizing revenue, we will constrain the estimate of variable consideration to an amount that is not probable of a significant revenue reversal. The ITC expired at the end of fiscal year 2024 with respect to fuel cells running on a non-zero carbon fuel.\nRecapture of Federal Tax Incentives, Including the ITC\nUntil the ITC expired at the end of fiscal year 2024 with respect to fuel cells running on a non-zero carbon fuel, our Energy Server systems were eligible for federal ITCs that accrued to qualified property under Internal Revenue Code Section 48 when placed into service. However, the ITC program has operational criteria that extends for five years. If the energy property is disposed of or otherwise ceases to be qualified investment credit property before the close of the five-year recapture period is fulfilled, it could result in a partial reduction of the ITC. Our sale of Energy Server systems to the PPA Entities and pursuant to the Third-Party PPAs, in each case pursuant to Portfolio Financings, generates ITCs benefiting the third-party owners of the PPA Entities or tax equity partnerships (the tax equity partnership purchaser, an “Investment Company”) and, therefore, the third-party owners of the PPA Entities or Investment Companies, as the case may be, bear the risk of recapture if the assets placed in service do not meet the ITC operational criteria in the future. \nWarranty Costs\nWe generally provide a manufacturer’s warranty to our products sold to our customers, international channel providers, and financing parties for up to one year following the date of COO of the Energy Server systems. This standard warranty covers defects in materials, workmanship and manufacturing or performance conditions under normal use and service conditions for the first year following COO. Such standard warranty is considered to be assurance-type warranty and consequently does not give rise to performance obligations under ASC 606 and are accounted for as warranty cost accruals under ASC 460 \n— Guarantees\n.\nWe recognize warranty costs for those contracts that are considered to be assurance-type warranties and consequently do not give rise to performance obligations or for those maintenance service contracts that were previously in the scope of ASC 605-20-25, \nSeparately Priced Extended Warranty and Product Maintenance Contracts\n.\nIn addition, as part of our standard warranty period and Managed Services Agreement obligations, we monitor the operations of the underlying systems and provide output and efficiency guaranties (collectively “product performance guaranties”). If the Energy Server systems run at a lower efficiency or power output than we committed under our performance warranty or guaranty, we will reimburse the customer for this underperformance. Our performance obligation includes ensuring the Energy Server systems operate at least at the efficiency and/or power output levels set forth in the customer agreement. Our aggregate reimbursement obligation for a performance guaranty for each customer is capped based on the purchase price of the underlying Energy Server systems. Product performance guaranty payments are accounted for as a reduction in service revenue. We accrue for performance guaranties based on the actual or estimated amounts (when actual data is not available) reimbursable at each reporting period and recognize the costs as a reduction to revenue.\nShipping and Handling Costs\nWe record costs related to shipping and handling in cost of product revenue, cost of installation revenue and cost of service as they are incurred.\n 94\nSales and Utility Taxes\nWe recognize revenue on a net basis for taxes charged to our customers and collected on behalf of the taxing authorities.\nSales Tax — \nSales tax collected from customers is recorded as a liability, pending remittance to the taxing jurisdiction. Consequently, sales taxes have been excluded from revenues and costs. It is recognized as a liability until remitted to the applicable state.\nOperating Expenses\nAdvertising and Promotion Costs — \nExpenses related to advertising and promotion of products are charged to sales and marketing expenses as incurred.\n Advertising and promotion expenses for the year ended December 31, 2024\n, was \n$\n1.4\n million. We did \nno\nt incur any material advertising or promotion expenses during the years ended December 31, 2023\n, and \n2022.\nResearch and Development — \nWe conduct internally funded research and development activities to improve anticipated product performance and reduce product life-cycle costs. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred and include salaries and expenses related to employees conducting research and development and other costs.\nStock-Based Compensation — \nWe account for time-based and performance-based stock options, restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and performance-based stock units (“PSUs”) awarded to employees and non-employee directors under the provisions of ASC 718, \nCompensation – Stock Compensation\n (“ASC 718”).\nStock-based compensation costs for time-based and performance-based stock options are measured using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The Black-Scholes valuation model uses as inputs the fair value of our common stock and assumptions we make for the volatility of our common stock, the expected term of the award, the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of the stock options and the expected dividend yield. In developing estimates used to calculate assumptions, we established the expected term for employee options as well as expected forfeiture rates based on the historical settlement experience and after giving consideration to vesting schedules. For options with a vesting condition tied to the attainment of service and market conditions, stock-based compensation costs are recognized using Monte Carlo simulations. Recognition of stock-based compensation expense associated with the performance-based stock options commences when the performance condition is considered probable of achievement, using management’s best estimates, which consider the inherent risk and uncertainty regarding the future outcomes of the milestones. Stock-based compensation costs are recorded net of estimated forfeitures such that expense is recorded only for those stock-based awards that are expected to vest. We typically record stock-based compensation costs for time-based and performance-based stock options under the straight-line attribution method over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting term, which is generally \nthree\n to \nfour years\n for options.\nStock-based compensation costs for RSUs and PSUs are measured based on the fair value of the underlying shares on the date of grant. We recognize the compensation cost for RSUs using a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the RSUs, which is generally \nthree\n to \nfour years\n. We recognize the compensation cost for PSUs over the expected performance period using the graded vesting method as the achievement of the milestones become probable, which is generally \none\n to \nthree years\n. \nWe also use the Black-Scholes valuation model to estimate the fair value of stock purchase rights under the Bloom Energy Corporation 2018 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “2018 ESPP”). The fair value of the 2018 ESPP purchase rights is recognized as an expense under the multiple options approach. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised in subsequent periods, if necessary, if actual forfeitures differ from initial estimates.\nStock issued to grantees in our stock-based compensation is from authorized and previously unissued shares. Stock-based compensation costs are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations based on the employees’ respective functions. Stock-based compensation costs directly associated with the product manufacturing operations process are capitalized into inventory and deferred cost of revenue and expensed when the capitalized asset is used in the normal course of the sales or services process.\nWe record deferred tax assets for awards that result in deductions on our income tax returns, unless we cannot realize the deduction (i.e., we are in a net operating loss position), based on the amount of compensation cost recognized and our statutory tax rate.\nRefer to Note 9 — \nStock-Based Compensation and Employee Benefit Plans \nfor further discussion of our stock-based compensation arrangements.\n 95\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes using the liability method under ASC 740, \nIncome Taxes\n (“ASC 740”). Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on net operating loss carryforwards, research and development credit carryforwards and temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes. Deferred items are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences reverse. Additionally, we must assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered as deductions from future taxable income. We have provided a full valuation allowance on our domestic deferred tax assets because we believe it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nWe follow the accounting guidance in ASC 740, which requires a more-likely-than-not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We record a liability for the difference between the benefit recognized and measured pursuant to ASC 740-10 and the tax position taken or expected to be taken on our tax return. To the extent that the assessment of such tax positions changes, the change in estimate is recorded in the period in which the determination is made. We established reserves for tax-related uncertainties based on estimates of whether, and the extent to which additional taxes will be due. These reserves are established when we believe that certain positions might be challenged despite our belief that the tax return positions are fully supportable. The reserves are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the outcome of a tax audit. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate. We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.\nRefer to Note 15 — \nIncome Taxes\n for further discussion of our income tax expense.\nComprehensive Loss\nOur comprehensive loss is comprised of net loss attributable to common stockholders, foreign currency translation adjustment, and comprehensive loss attributable to noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest.\nFair Value Measurement\nASC 820, \nFair Value Measurement\n (“ASC 820”), defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value under U.S. GAAP and enhances disclosures about fair value measurements. Fair value is defined under ASC 820 as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principle or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value under ASC 820 must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The guidance describes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable, that may be used to measure fair value:\nLevel 1\nQuoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Financial assets utilizing Level 1 inputs typically include money market securities and U.S. Treasury securities.\nLevel 2\nInputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. There were neither financial assets, nor financial liabilities as of December 31, 2024, and 2023, utilizing Level 2 inputs.\nLevel 3\nUnobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. Financial liabilities utilizing Level 3 inputs include contract embedded derivatives. Their valuations are performed using a Monte Carlo simulation model which considers various potential electricity price curves over the sales contract terms.\nOther Balance Sheet Components\nCash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash — \nCash equivalents consist of highly liquid short-term investments with maturities of 90 days or less at the date of purchase.\nRestricted cash is held as collateral to provide financial assurance that we will fulfill obligations and commitments primarily related to the Third-Party PPAs and Managed Services Agreements. Restricted cash also includes debt service reserves, maintenance service reserves and facility lease agreements. Restricted cash that is expected to be used within one year \n 96\nof the balance sheet date is classified as a current asset, whereas restricted cash expected to be used more than one year from the balance sheet date is classified as a non-current asset.\nDerivatives — \nWe account for our derivative instruments as a liability which are carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets. Changes in the fair value of those derivatives are recorded through earnings in the consolidated statements of operations, as they do not qualify neither as cash flow hedges, nor for hedge accounting.\nAccounts Receivable — \nAccounts receivable primarily represent trade receivables from sales to customers recorded at amortized cost less allowance for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses reflects our best estimate about future losses over the contractual life of outstanding accounts receivable taking into consideration historical experience, specific allowances for known troubled accounts, other currently available information including customer financial condition, and both current and forecasted economic conditions.\nInventories — \nInventories consist principally of raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods and are stated on a first-in, first-out basis at a lower of cost or net realizable value. We record inventory excess and obsolescence provisions for estimated obsolete or unsellable inventory, equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and estimated net realizable value based upon assumptions about market conditions and future demand for products generally expected to be utilized over the next 12 to 24 months, including product needed to fulfill our warranty obligations. If actual future demand for our products is less than currently forecasted, additional inventory provisions may be required. Once a provision is recorded, it is maintained until the product to which it relates is sold or otherwise disposed.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment — \nProperty, plant and equipment, including leasehold improvements, are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. The Energy Server systems are depreciated to their residual values over their useful economic lives which reflect consideration of the terms of their related PPA and tariff agreements. These useful lives are reassessed when there is an expected change in the use of the Energy Server systems. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or their estimated depreciable lives. Buildings are amortized over the shorter of the lease or property term or their estimated depreciable lives. Assets under construction are capitalized as costs are incurred and depreciation commences after the assets are put into service within their respective asset class.\nDepreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated depreciable lives of the respective assets as follows:\nDepreciable Lives\nEnergy Server systems\n15\n-\n21\n years\nComputers, software and hardware\n3\n-\n5\n years\nVehicles, machinery and equipment\n5\n-\n10\n years\nFurniture and fixtures\n3\n-\n5\n years\nLeasehold improvements\n1\n-\n10\n years\nBuildings\n*\n* Lesser of \n35\n years or the term of the underlying land lease.\nWhen assets are retired or disposed of, the assets and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from our consolidated financial statements and the resulting gain or loss is reflected in the consolidated statements of operations.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\n — Our long-lived assets include property, plant and equipment and the Energy Server systems capitalized in connection with our Managed Services Financing Program, Portfolio Financings and other similar arrangements. The carrying amounts of our long-lived assets are periodically reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable or that the useful life is shorter than originally estimated.\n Impairment charges for the year ended December 31, 2024, amounted to $\n87.0\n million related to the termination of failed sale-and-leaseback transactions and were recorded in other income (expense), net on our consolidated statements of operations. Impairment charges for the year ended December 31, 2023, amounted to $\n123.7\n million related to the PPA V Repowering and $\n2.3\n million related to the termination of a failed sale-and-leaseback transaction, and were recorded in cost of electricity revenue and in other income (expense), net on our consolidated statements of operations, respectively. Impairment charges for the year ended December 31, 2022, amounted to $\n44.8\n million and $\n64.0\n million related to the PPA IIIa \n 97\nand PPA IV Repowerings, respectively, and were recorded in cost of electricity revenue on our consolidated statements of operations.\nAllocation of Profits and Losses of Consolidated Entities to Noncontrolling Interests — \nWe generally allocate profits and losses to noncontrolling interests under the hypothetical liquidation at book value (“HLBV”) method. The determination of equity in earnings under the HLBV method requires management to determine how proceeds, upon a hypothetical liquidation of the entity at book value, would be allocated between our investors. The noncontrolling interest balance is presented as a component of permanent equity in the consolidated balance sheets.\nFor income tax purposes, the Equity Investors of the PPA Entities receive a greater proportion of the share of losses and other income tax benefits. This includes the allocation of investment tax credits which are distributed to the Equity Investors through an Investment Company subsidiary of Bloom. Allocations are initially based on the terms specified in each respective partnership agreement until either a specific date or the Equity Investors’ targeted rate of return specified in the partnership agreement is met (the “flip” of the flip structure) whereupon the allocations change. In some cases, after the Equity Investors receive their contractual rate of return, we receive substantially all of the remaining value attributable to the long-term recurring customer payments and the other incentives. In August 2023, we sold our last consolidated PPA Entity being our VIE, PPA V, as a result of the PPA V Repowering of the Energy Server systems (see Note 10 — \nPortfolio Financings\n). As of December 31, 2024, and 2023, we had one VIE which we consolidate, Korean JV, which profit and loss are allocated to noncontrolling interests under the HLBV method.\nForeign Currency Considerations\nItems included in the financial statements of each of the Company’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (the “functional currency”). The functional currency of the Company’s parent entity is the U.S. dollar.\nThe functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries are local currencies. The functional currency of our joint venture in the Republic of Korea is the local currency, the South Korean won (“KRW”), since the joint venture is financially independent of its U.S. parent and the KRW is the currency in which the joint venture generates and expends cash. The assets and liabilities of these entities are translated at the rate of exchange at the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated at the weighted average rate of exchange during the period. For these entities, translation adjustments resulting from the process of translating the local currency financial statements into the U.S. dollars are included in other comprehensive loss. Translation adjustments attributable to noncontrolling interests are allocated to and reported as part of the noncontrolling interests in the consolidated financial statements.\nTransactions made in a currency other than the functional currency are remeasured to the functional currency at exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are remeasured to the functional currency at the exchange rate at that date and non-monetary assets and liabilities are measured at historical rates. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included as a component of other income (expense), net in our consolidated statements of operations.\nThe reporting currency for these consolidated financial statements is the U.S. dollar.\nAccounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-04 \nDebt — Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20)\n (“ASU 2024-04”). ASU 2024-04 clarifies the requirements for determining whether certain settlements of convertible debt instruments should be accounted for as an induced conversion. The standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2025, and interim periods within those annual reporting periods. Early adoption is permitted for all entities that have adopted the amendments in ASU 2020-06. We are currently evaluating this guidance, but do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, \nIncome Statement — Reporting Comprehensive Income — Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses\n (“ASU 2024-03”). ASU 2024-03 is intended to enhance transparency of income statement disclosures primarily through additional disaggregation of relevant expense captions. The standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2027, with prospective or retrospective application permitted. We are currently evaluating this guidance, but do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n 98\nIn March 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-02, \nCodification Improvements — Amendments to Remove References to the Concepts Statements \n(“ASU 2024-02”). This guidance is intended to remove references to various FASB Concepts Statements. The Board has a standing project on its agenda to address suggestions received from stakeholders on the Accounting Standards Codification and other incremental improvements to U.S. GAAP. This effort facilitates Codification updates for technical corrections such as conforming amendments, clarifications to guidance, simplifications to wording or the structure of guidance, and other minor improvements. The resulting amendments are referred to as Codification improvements. The amendments in ASU 2024-02 are not intended to result in significant accounting change for most entities. We are currently evaluating this guidance, but do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn March 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-01, \nCompensation — Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope Application of Profits Interest and Similar Awards \n(“ASU 2024-01”). This guidance is intended to improve U.S. GAAP. by adding an illustrative example to demonstrate how an entity should apply the scope guidance in paragraph 718-10-15-3 to determine whether profits interest and similar awards (“profits interest awards”) should be accounted for in accordance with Topic 718, \nCompensation — Stock Compensation\n. The amendments in ASU 2024-01 are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, and interim periods within those annual periods. The amendments in ASU 2024-01 should be applied either (1) retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements or (2) prospectively to profits interest and similar awards granted or modified on or after the date at which the entity first applies the amendments. We are currently evaluating this guidance, but do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-05, \nBusiness Combinations — Joint Venture Formations (Subtopic 805-60): Recognition and Initial Measurement\n (“ASU 2023-05”), which addresses the accounting for contributions made to a joint venture. ASU 2023-05 requires joint ventures to measure all assets and liabilities upon formation at fair value. This guidance will be applied prospectively to all joint venture formations with a formation date on or after January 1, 2025. We have evaluated this guidance, and do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, \nIncome Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures \n(“ASU 2023-09”). ASU 2023-09 addresses investor requests for more transparency about income tax information through improvements to income tax disclosures primarily related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information. This guidance will be applied on a prospective basis and is effective for annual reporting periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Retrospective application is permitted. We are currently evaluating the potential impact, but we do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, \nSegment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\n (“ASU 2023-07”). ASU 2023-07 requires disclosure of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker and included within the segment measure of profit or loss, and a description of how the chief operating decision maker utilizes segment operating profit or loss to assess segment performance. We adopted this accounting standard in fiscal year 2024. While the adoption has no impact on our financial statements, it has resulted in incremental disclosures within the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements.\nThere have been no significant changes in our reported financial position or results of operations and cash flows resulting from the adoption of new accounting pronouncements.\n 99\n3. \nRevenue Recognition\nContract Balances\nThe following table provides information about accounts receivables, contract assets, customer deposits and deferred revenue from contracts with customers (in thousands):\nDecember 31,\n\n2024\n2023\nAccounts receivable\n$\n335,841\n\n$\n340,740\n\nContract assets\n145,162\n\n41,366\n\nCustomer deposits\n220,115\n\n75,734\n\nDeferred revenue \n66,304\n\n72,328\n\nContract assets relate to contracts for which revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of performance obligations, but where billing milestones have not been reached. Contract liabilities are represented by deferred revenue. Customer deposits and deferred revenue include payments received from customers or invoiced amounts prior to transfer of goods or services. \nContract assets and contract liabilities are reported in a net position on an individual contract basis at the end of each reporting period. Contract assets are classified as current in the consolidated balance sheets when the milestones other than the passage of time, are expected to be complete and the customer is invoiced within one year of the balance sheet date, and as long-term when both the above-mentioned milestones are expected to be complete, and the customer is invoiced more than one year from the balance sheet date. Contract liabilities are classified as current in the consolidated balance sheets when the revenue recognition associated with the related customer payments and invoicing is expected to occur within one year of the balance sheet date and as long-term when the revenue recognition associated with the related customer payments and invoicing is expected to occur in more than one year from the balance sheet date.\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024, our related party settled $\n223.9\n million of accounts receivable (see Note 11 — \nRelated Party Transactions\n).\nThe increase in contract assets of $\n103.8\n million for the year ended December 31, 2024, was driven by the timing of achieving billing milestones.\nThe increase in customer deposits of $\n144.4\n million for the year ended December 31, 2024, was driven by receipt of new deposits, partially offset by certain deposits becoming non-refundable.\nContract Assets \nYears Ended \nDecember 31,\n2024\n2023\nBeginning balance\n$\n41,366\n\n$\n46,727\n\nTransferred to accounts receivable from contract assets recognized at the beginning of the period, net of other adjustments\n(\n34,314\n)\n(\n41,064\n)\nRevenue recognized and not billed as of the end of the period\n1\n138,110\n\n35,703\n\nEnding balance\n$\n145,162\n\n$\n41,366\n\n1 \nIncluded $\n9.6\n million that have already been paid to customer’s customer for the year ended December 31, 2024. There were \nno\n other adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n 100\nDeferred Revenue\nDeferred revenue activity during the years ended December 31, 2024, and 2023, consisted of the following (in thousands):\nYears Ended \nDecember 31,\n2024\n2023\nBeginning balance\n$\n72,328\n\n$\n94,355\n\nAdditions\n1,142,599\n\n1,014,175\n\nRevenue recognized\n(\n1,148,623\n)\n(\n1,036,202\n)\nEnding balance\n$\n66,304\n\n$\n72,328\n\nDeferred revenue is equivalent to the total transaction price allocated to the performance obligations that are unsatisfied, or partially unsatisfied, as of the end of the period. The primary component of deferred revenue at the end of the period consists of performance obligations relating to the provision of maintenance services under current contracts and future renewal periods. Some of these obligations provide customers with material rights over a period that we estimate to be largely commensurate with the period of their expected use of the associated products. As a result, we expect to recognize these amounts as revenue over a period of up to \n21\n years, predominantly on a relative stand-alone selling price basis that reflects the cost of providing these services. Deferred revenue also includes performance obligations relating to product acceptance and installation. A significant amount of this deferred revenue is reflected as additions and revenue recognized in the same 12-month period, and a portion of this deferred revenue is expected to be recognized beyond this 12-month period mainly due to deployment schedules.\nWe do not disclose the value of the unsatisfied performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and (ii) contracts for which we recognize revenue at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for services performed.\nDisaggregated Revenue\nWe disaggregate revenue from contracts with customers into \nfour\n revenue categories: product, installation, service and electricity (in thousands): \nYears Ended \nDecember 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nRevenue from contracts with customers:\nProduct revenue\n$\n1,085,153\n\n$\n975,245\n\n$\n880,664\n\nInstallation revenue\n122,318\n\n92,796\n\n92,120\n\nService revenue\n213,542\n\n183,065\n\n150,954\n\nElectricity revenue\n20,381\n\n17,676\n\n11,608\n\nTotal revenue from contracts with customers\n1,441,394\n\n1,268,782\n\n1,135,346\n\nRevenue from contracts that contain leases:\nElectricity revenue\n32,462\n\n64,688\n\n63,779\n\nTotal revenue\n$\n1,473,856\n\n$\n1,333,470\n\n$\n1,199,125\n\n 101\n4. \nFinancial Instruments\nCash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash\nThe carrying values of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash approximate fair values and were as follows (in thousands):\nDecember 31,\n\n2024\n2023\nAs Held:\nCash\n$\n201,613\n\n$\n144,102\n\nMoney market funds\n749,358\n\n601,076\n\n$\n950,971\n\n$\n745,178\n\nAs Reported:\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n802,851\n\n$\n664,593\n\nRestricted cash\n148,120\n\n80,585\n\n$\n950,971\n\n$\n745,178\n\nRestricted cash consisted of the following (in thousands):\nDecember 31,\n\n2024\n2023\n\nRestricted cash, current\n$\n110,622\n\n$\n46,821\n\nRestricted cash, non-current\n37,498\n\n33,764\n\n$\n148,120\n\n$\n80,585\n\nFactoring Arrangements\nWe sell certain customer trade receivables on a non-recourse basis under factoring arrangements with certain financial institutions. These transactions are accounted for as sales and cash proceeds are included in cash used in operating activities. We derecognized $\n184.2\n million, $\n291.4\n million, and $\n283.3\n million of accounts receivable during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. \nThe cost of factoring such accounts receivable on our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, was $\n4.0\n million, $\n5.5\n million, and $\n4.0\n million, respectively. The cost of factoring is recorded in general and administrative expenses.\n5. \nFair Value\nOur accounting policy for the fair value measurement of cash equivalents is described in Note 2 \n—\n\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\n. \n 102\nFinancial Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\nThe tables below set forth, by level, our financial assets and liabilities that are accounted for at fair value for the respective periods. The table does not include assets and liabilities that are measured at historical cost or any basis other than fair value (in thousands):\nFair Value Measured at Reporting Date Using\nDecember 31, 2024\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nTotal\nAssets\nCash equivalents:\nMoney market funds\n$\n749,358\n\n$\n—\n\n$\n—\n\n$\n749,358\n\nLiabilities\nDerivatives:\nEmbedded EPP derivatives\n$\n—\n\n$\n—\n\n$\n5,070\n\n$\n5,070\n\nFair Value Measured at Reporting Date Using\nDecember 31, 2023\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nTotal\nAssets\nCash equivalents:\nMoney market funds\n$\n601,076\n\n$\n—\n\n$\n—\n\n$\n601,076\n\nLiabilities\nDerivatives:\nEmbedded EPP derivatives\n$\n—\n\n$\n—\n\n$\n4,376\n\n$\n4,376\n\nMoney Market Funds — \nMoney market funds are valued using quoted market prices for identical securities and are therefore classified as Level 1 financial assets.\nEmbedded Escalation Protection Plan Derivative Liability in Sales Contracts — \nWe estimate the fair value of the embedded EPP derivatives in certain sales contracts using a Monte Carlo simulation model, which considers various potential electricity price curves over the sales contracts’ terms. We use historical grid prices and available forecasts of future electricity prices to estimate future electricity prices. We have classified these derivatives as Level 3 financial liability. \nThe changes in the Level 3 financial liabilities during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 \nand \n2022, were as follows (in thousands):\nEmbedded EPP Derivative Liability\nLiabilities at December 31, 2022\n$\n5,895\n\nEPP liability settlement\n(\n3,160\n)\nChanges in fair value\n1,641\n\nLiabilities at December 31, 2023\n4,376\n\nChanges in fair value\n694\n\nLiabilities at December 31, 2024\n$\n5,070\n\nTo estimate the liabilities related to the EPP contracts, an option pricing method was implemented through a Monte Carlo simulation, which considers various potential electricity price forward curves over the sales contracts’ terms. We use historical grid prices and available forecasts to estimate future electricity prices. The grid pricing EPP guarantees that we provided in some of our sales arrangements represent an embedded derivative, with the initial value accounted for as a reduction in product revenue and any changes, reevaluated quarterly, in the fair market value of the derivative recorded in (Loss) gain on revaluation of embedded derivatives.\n 103\nThe unobservable inputs were simulated based on the available values for avoided cost and cost of electricity as calculated for December 31, 2024, and 2023, using an expected growth rate of \n7\n% over the contracts’ life and volatility of \n15\n%. The estimated growth rate and volatility were estimated based on the historical tariff changes for the period 2008 to 2024. Avoided cost is the transmission and distribution cost expressed in dollars per kilowatt hours avoided in the given year of the contract, calculated using the billing rates of the effective utility tariff applied during the year to the host account for which usage is offset by the generator. If the billing rates within the utility tariff change during the measurement period, the average amount of charge for each rate shall be weighted by the number of effective months for each amount.\nThe inputs listed above would have had a direct impact on the fair values of the EPP derivatives if they were adjusted. Generally, a decrease in electric grid prices would result in an increase in the estimated fair value of our EPP derivative liabilities.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we recorded the fair value of the embedded EPP derivatives with no material unrealized gains or losses in either of the three years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, in our consolidated statements of operations. The fair value of these derivatives was $\n5.1\n million and $\n4.4\n million as of December 31, 2024, and 2023, respectively.\nIn June 2023, according to an EPP agreement with one of our customers, we paid $\n3.2\n million, which was recorded as a reduction to our balance of embedded EPP derivative liability as of December 31, 2023.\nFinancial Assets and Liabilities Not Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\nDebt Instruments — \nThe term loans and convertible senior notes are based on rates currently offered for instruments with similar maturities and terms (Level 2). \nThe following table presents the estimated fair values and carrying values of debt instruments (in thousands):\n\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\n\nNet Carrying\nValue\nFair Value\nNet Carrying\nValue\nFair Value\n\nDebt instruments\nRecourse:\n3\n% Green Convertible Senior Notes due June 2029\n$\n391,239\n\n$\n532,789\n\n$\n—\n\n$\n—\n\n3\n% Green Convertible Senior Notes due June 2028\n619,111\n\n872,344\n\n615,205\n\n673,613\n\n2.5\n% Green Convertible Senior Notes due August 2025\n114,385\n\n163,875\n\n226,801\n\n260,820\n\nNon-recourse:\n4.6\n% Term Loan due October 2026\n2,705\n\n2,856\n\n3,085\n\n2,866\n\n4.6\n% Term Loan due April 2026\n$\n1,352\n\n$\n1,482\n\n$\n1,542\n\n$\n1,479\n\n6. \nBalance Sheet Components\nInventories\nThe components of inventory consist of the following (in thousands):\nDecember 31,\n\n2024\n2023\nRaw materials\n$\n315,735\n\n$\n270,414\n\nWork-in-progress\n79,601\n\n50,632\n\nFinished goods\n149,320\n\n181,469\n\n$\n544,656\n\n$\n502,515\n\n 104\nThe inventory reserves were $\n15.9\n million and $\n18.7\n million as of December 31, 2024, and 2023, respectively.\nPrepaid Expenses and Other Current Assets\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets consist of the following (in thousands):\nDecember 31,\n\n2024\n2023\n\nPrepaid hardware and software maintenance\n$\n7,972\n\n$\n5,202\n\nPrepaid workers compensation\n7,394\n\n6,851\n\nPrepaid managed services\n5,230\n\n5,636\n\nTax receivables\n4,981\n\n3,231\n\nReceivables from employees\n3,259\n\n6,538\n\nInterest receivable\n1,316\n\n1,697\n\nDeferred expenses (Note 17)\n1,215\n\n2,257\n\nPrepaid deferred commissions\n1,123\n\n1,178\n\nDeposits made\n348\n\n1,702\n\nPrepaid rent\n21\n\n1,232\n\nAdvance income tax provision\n—\n\n2,557\n\nOther prepaid expenses and other current assets\n13,344\n\n13,067\n\n$\n46,203\n\n$\n51,148\n\nProperty, Plant and Equipment, Net\nProperty, plant and equipment, net, consists of the following (in thousands):\nDecember 31,\n\n2024\n2023\n\nVehicles, machinery and equipment\n$\n200,004\n\n$\n174,549\n\nEnergy Server systems\n165,629\n\n309,770\n\nLeasehold improvements\n122,413\n\n94,646\n\nConstruction-in-progress\n86,731\n\n104,650\n\nBuildings\n53,221\n\n49,477\n\nComputers, software and hardware\n33,910\n\n28,901\n\nFurniture and fixtures\n10,943\n\n12,541\n\n672,851\n\n774,534\n\nLess: accumulated depreciation\n(\n269,376\n)\n(\n281,182\n)\n$\n403,475\n\n$\n493,352\n\nDepreciation expense related to property, plant and equipment was $\n53.0\n million, $\n62.6\n million and $\n61.6\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\nDepreciation expense for property, plant and equipment under operating leases by PPA V (sold in August 2023) was $\n10.9\n million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Depreciation expense for property, plant and equipment under operating leases by PPA V, PPA IV (sold in November 2022), and PPA IIIa (sold in June 2022) was $\n12.1\n million for the year ended December 31, 2022. There was \nno\n depreciation expense for such assets for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nPPA IIIa Repowering\nIn June 2022, we started a project (the “PPA IIIa Repowering”) to replace \n9.8\n megawatts of the Energy Server systems (the “old PPA IIIa Energy Servers”) at PPA IIIa Investment Company and Operating Company (“PPA IIIa”) with current \n 105\ngeneration Energy Server systems (the “new PPA IIIa Energy Servers”). The replacement was completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022. See Note 10 \n—\n\nPortfolio Financings \nfor additional information.\nPPA IV Repowering\nIn November 2022, we started a project (the “PPA IV Repowering”) to replace \n19.3\n megawatts of the Energy Server systems (the “old PPA IV Energy Servers”) at PPA IV Investment Company and Operating Company (“PPA IV”) with current generation Energy Server systems (the “new PPA IV Energy Servers”). The replacement was completed in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024. See Note 10 \n—\n\nPortfolio Financings \nfor additional information.\nPPA V Repowering\nIn August 2023, we started a project (the “PPA V Repowering”) to replace \n37.1\n megawatts of the Energy Server systems (the “old PPA V Energy Servers”) at PPA V with current generation Energy Server systems (the “new PPA V Energy Servers”). The replacement was completed in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024. See Note 10 \n—\n\nPortfolio Financings\n for additional information.\nAssets Buyout and Repowering\nIn fiscal years 2024 and 2023, we terminated certain of our legacy managed services agreements, previously recorded as failed sale and lease-back transactions upon inception and bought back the old Energy Server systems from the respective legacy financiers. Total cost of Energy Server systems bought back was $\n144.1\n million and $\n3.3\n million, respectively.

The \n3\n% Green Notes due June 2029 were issued pursuant to, and are governed by, an indenture, dated as of May 29, 2024, between us and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as Trustee (the “\n3\n% Green Notes due June 2029 Indenture”), in private placements to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”).\nPursuant to the purchase agreement among the Company and the representatives of the initial purchasers of the \n3\n% Green Notes due June 2029, the Company granted the initial purchasers an option to purchase up to an additional $\n52.5\n million \n 108\naggregate principal amount of the \n3\n% Green Notes due June 2029 (the “\n3\n% Green Notes due June 2029 Greenshoe Option”). The \n3\n% Green Notes due June 2029 issued on May 29, 2024, included $\n52.5\n million aggregate principal amount pursuant to the full exercise by the initial purchasers of the \n3\n% Green Notes due June 2029 Greenshoe Option.\nThe \n3\n% Green Notes due June 2029 are senior, unsecured obligations accruing interest at a rate of \n3\n% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on December 1, 2024.\nWe may not redeem the \n3\n% Green Notes due June 2029 prior to June 7, 2027, subject to a partial redemption limitation. We may elect to redeem, at face value, all or any portion of the \n3\n% Green Notes due June 2029 at any time, and from time to time, on or after June 7, 2027, and on or before the twenty-first scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date, provided the share price for our Class A common stock exceeds \n130\n% of the conversion price at redemption.\nBefore March 1, 2029, the noteholders have the right to convert their \n3\n% Green Notes due June 2029 only upon the occurrence of certain events, including satisfaction of a condition relating to the closing price of our common stock (the “\n3\n% Green Notes due June 2029 Closing Price Condition”) or the trading price of the \n3\n% Green Notes due June 2029 (the “\n3\n% Green Notes due June 2029 Trading Price Condition”), a redemption event, or other specified corporate events. If the \n3\n% Green Notes due June 2029 Closing Price Condition is met on at least \n20\n (whether or not consecutive) of the last \n30\n consecutive trading days in any calendar quarter, and only during such calendar quarter, the noteholders may convert their \n3\n%\n\nGreen Notes due June 2029 at any time during the immediately following quarter, commencing after the calendar quarter ending on September 30, 2024, subject to the partial redemption limitation. The \n3\n% Green Notes due June 2029 Closing Price Condition was not met during the three months ended September 30, 2024, and accordingly, the noteholders could not convert their \n3\n% Green Notes due June 2029 during the quarter ended December 31, 2024.\nSubject to the \n3\n% Green Notes due June 2029 Trading Price Condition, the noteholders may convert their \n3\n% Green Notes due June 2029 during the \nfive\n business days immediately after any \nfive\n consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of the \n3\n% Green Notes due June 2029, as determined following a request by a holder of the \n3\n% Green Notes due June 2029, for each day of that period is less than \n98\n% of the product of the closing price of our common stock and the then applicable conversion rate. From and after March 1, 2029, the noteholders may convert their \n3\n% Green Notes due June 2029 at any time at their election until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date. Should the noteholders elect to convert their \n3\n% Green Notes due June 2029, we may elect to settle the conversion by paying or delivering, as applicable, cash, shares of our Class A common stock, $\n0.0001\n par value per share, or a combination thereof, at our election.\nThe initial conversion rate is 47.9795 shares of Class A common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes, which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $\n20.84\n per share of Class A common stock. The conversion rate and conversion price are subject to customary adjustments upon the occurrence of certain events. Also, we may increase the conversion rate at any time if our Board of Directors determines it is in the best interests of the Company or to avoid or diminish income tax to holders of common stock. In addition, if certain corporate events that constitute a Make-Whole Fundamental Change, as defined below, occur, then the conversion rate applicable to the conversion of the \n3\n% Green Notes due June 2029 will, in certain circumstances, increase by up to 15.5932 shares of Class A common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes for a specified period of time. At December 31, 2024, the maximum number of shares into which the \n3\n% Green Notes due June 2029 could have been potentially converted if the conversion features were triggered was \n25,588,011\n shares of Class A common stock.\nAccording to the \n3\n% Green Notes due June 2029 Indenture, a Make-Whole Fundamental Change means (i) a Fundamental Change, that includes certain change-of-control events relating to us, certain business combination transactions involving us and certain delisting events with respect to our Class A common stock, or (ii) the sending of a redemption notice with respect to the \n3\n% Green Notes due June 2029.\nThe \n3\n% Green Notes due June 2029 contain certain customary provisions relating to the occurrence of Events of Default, as defined in the \n3\n% Green Notes due June 2029 Indenture. If an Event of Default involving bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization events with respect to us occurs, then the principal amount of, and all accrued and unpaid interest on, all of the \n3\n% Green Notes due June 2029 then outstanding will immediately become due and payable without any further action or notice by any person. However, notwithstanding the foregoing, we may elect, at our option, that the sole remedy for an Event of Default relating to certain failures by us to comply with certain reporting covenants in the \n3\n% Green Notes due June 2029 Indenture consists exclusively of the right of the noteholders to receive special interest on the \n3\n% Green Notes due June 2029 for up to \n180\n days at a specified rate per annum not exceeding \n0.5\n% on the principal amount of the \n3\n% Green Notes due June 2029.\n 109\nThe \n3\n% Green Notes due June 2029 Transaction Costs were recorded as debt issuance costs and presented a reduction to the \n3\n% Green Notes due June 2029 on our consolidated balance sheets and are amortized to interest expense at an effective interest rate of \n3.8\n%.\nTotal interest expense recognized related to the \n3\n% Green Notes due June 2029 for the year ended December 31, 2024, was $\n8.6\n million, and was comprised of (i) contractual interest expense and (ii) amortization of the initial purchasers’ discount and other issuance costs of $\n7.1\n million and $\n1.5\n million, respectively. We have not recognized any special interest expense related to the \n3\n% Green Notes due June 2029 to date. The amount of unamortized debt issuance costs as of December 31, 2024, was $\n11.3\n million.\nAlthough the \n3\n% Green Notes due June 2029 contain embedded conversion features, we account for the \n3\n% Green Notes due June 2029 in its entirety as a liability. As of December 31, 2024, the net carrying value of the \n3\n% Green Notes due June 2029 was classified as a long-term liability in our consolidated balance sheets.\n3\n% Green Convertible Senior Notes due June 2028\nOn May 16, 2023, we issued the \n3\n% Green Convertible Senior Notes (the “\n3\n% Green Notes due June 2028”) in an aggregate principal amount of $\n632.5\n million due on June 1, 2028, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted, less an initial purchasers’ discount of $\n15.8\n million and other issuance costs of $\n3.9\n million (together, the “\n3\n% Green Notes due June 2028 Transaction Costs”), resulting in net proceeds of $\n612.8\n million. The \n3\n% Green Notes due June 2028 were issued pursuant to, and are governed by, an indenture, dated as of May 16, 2023, between us and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as Trustee (the “\n3\n% Green Notes due June 2028 Indenture”), in private placements to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to the Securities Act.\nPursuant to the purchase agreement among us and the representatives of the initial purchasers of the \n3\n% Green Notes due June 2028, we granted the initial purchasers an option to purchase up to an additional $\n82.5\n million aggregate principal amount of the \n3\n% Green Notes due June 2028 (the “\n3\n% Green Notes due June 2028 Greenshoe Option”). The \n3\n% Green Notes due June 2028 issued on May 16, 2023, included $\n82.5\n million aggregate principal amount pursuant to the full exercise by the initial purchasers of the \n3\n% Green Notes due June 2028 Greenshoe Option.\nThe \n3\n% Green Notes due June 2028 are senior, unsecured obligations accruing interest at a rate of \n3\n% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on December 1, 2023.\nWe may not redeem the \n3\n% Green Notes due June 2028 prior to June 5, 2026, subject to a partial redemption limitation. We may elect to redeem, at face value, all or any portion of the \n3\n% Green Notes due June 2028 at any time, and from time to time, on or after June 5, 2026, and on or before the forty-sixth scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date, provided the share price for our Class A common stock exceeds \n130\n% of the conversion price at redemption.\nBefore March 1, 2028, the noteholders have the right to convert their \n3\n% Green Notes due June 2028 only upon the occurrence of certain events, including satisfaction of a condition relating to the closing price of our common stock (the “\n3\n% Green Notes due June 2028 Closing Price Condition”) or the trading price of the \n3\n% Green Notes due June 2028 (the “\n3\n% Green Notes due June 2028 Trading Price Condition”), a redemption event, or other specified corporate events. If the \n3\n% Green Notes due June 2028 Closing Price Condition is met on at least \n20\n (whether or not consecutive) of the last \n30\n consecutive trading days in any calendar quarter, and only during such calendar quarter, the noteholders may convert their \n3\n% Green Notes due June 2028 at any time during the immediately following quarter, commencing after the calendar quarter ending on September 30, 2023, subject to partial redemption limitation. The \n3\n% Green Notes due June 2028 Closing Price Condition was not met during the three months ended September 30, 2024, and accordingly, the noteholders could not convert their \n3\n% Green Notes due June 2028 during the quarter ended December 31, 2024.\nSubject to the \n3\n% Green Notes due June 2028 Trading Price Condition, the noteholders may convert their \n3\n% Green Notes due June 2028 during the \nfive\n business days immediately after any \nfive\n consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of the \n3\n% Green Notes, as determined following a request by a holder of the \n3\n% Green Notes due June 2028, for each day of that period is less than \n98\n% of the product of the closing price of our common stock and the then applicable conversion rate. From and after March 1, 2028, the noteholders may convert their \n3\n% Green Notes due June 2028 at any time at their election until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date. Should the noteholders elect to convert their \n3\n% Green Notes due June 2028, we may elect to settle the conversion by paying or delivering, as applicable, cash, shares of our Class A common stock, $\n0.0001\n par value per share, or a combination thereof, at our election.\n 110\nThe initial conversion rate is 53.0427 shares of Class A common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes, which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $\n18.85\n per share of Class A common stock. The conversion rate and conversion price are subject to customary adjustments upon the occurrence of certain events. Also, we may increase the conversion rate at any time if our Board of Directors determines it is in the best interests of the Company or to avoid or diminish income tax to holders of common stock. In addition, if certain corporate events that constitute a Make-Whole Fundamental Change, as defined below, occur, then the conversion rate applicable to the conversion of the \n3\n% Green Notes due June 2028 may, in certain circumstances, be increased by up to 22.5430 shares of Class A common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes for a specified period of time. On December 31, 2024, the maximum number of shares into which the \n3\n% Green Notes due June 2028 could have been potentially converted if the conversion features were triggered was \n47,807,955\n shares of Class A common stock.\nAccording to the \n3\n% Green Notes due June 2028 Indenture, a Make-Whole Fundamental Change means (i) a Fundamental Change, that includes certain change-of-control events relating to us, certain business combination transactions involving us and certain delisting events with respect to our Class A common stock, or (ii) the sending of a redemption notice with respect to the \n3\n% Green Notes due June 2028.\nThe \n3\n% Green Notes due June 2028 contain certain customary provisions relating to the occurrence of Events of Default, as defined in the \n3\n% Green Notes due June 2028 Indenture. If an Event of Default involving bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization events with respect to us occurs, then the principal amount of, and all accrued and unpaid interest on, all of the \n3\n% Green Notes due June 2028 then outstanding will immediately become due and payable without any further action or notice by any person. However, notwithstanding the foregoing, we may elect, at our option, that the sole remedy for an Event of Default relating to certain failures by us to comply with certain reporting covenants in the \n3\n% Green Notes due June 2028 Indenture consists exclusively of the right of the noteholders to receive special interest on the \n3\n% Green Notes due June 2028 for up to \n180\n days at a specified rate per annum not exceeding \n0.50\n% on the principal amount of the \n3\n% Green Notes due June 2028.\nThe \n3\n% Green Notes due June 2028 Transaction Costs were recorded as debt issuance costs and presented a reduction to the \n3\n% Green Notes due June 2028 on our consolidated balance sheets and are amortized to interest expense at an effective interest rate of \n3.8\n%.\nThe total interest expense recognized related to the \n3\n% Green Notes due June 2028 for the years ended December 31, 2024, and 2023, was $\n22.9\n million and $\n14.4\n million, respectively and was comprised of contractual interest expense of $\n19.0\n million and $\n12.0\n million and amortization of the initial purchasers’ discount and other issuance costs of $\n3.9\n million and $\n2.4\n million, respectively. We have not recognized any special interest expense related to the \n3\n% Green Notes to date. The amount of unamortized debt issuance costs as of December 31, 2024, and 2023, was $\n13.4\n million and $\n17.3\n million.\nAlthough the \n3\n% Green Notes due June 2028 contain embedded conversion features, we account for the \n3\n% Green Notes due June 2028 in its entirety as a liability. As of December 31, 2024, and 2023, the net carrying value of the \n3\n% Green Notes due June 2028 was classified as a long-term liability in our consolidated balance sheets.\nCapped Calls\nOn May 11, 2023, in connection with the pricing of the \n3\n% Green Notes due June 2028, and on May 15, 2023, in connection with initial purchasers’ exercise of the \n3\n% Green Notes due June 2028 Greenshoe Option, we entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions (the “Capped Calls”) with certain counterparties (the “Option Counterparties”). The Capped Calls cover, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments substantially similar to those applicable to the \n3\n% Green Notes due June 2028, the aggregate number of shares of our Class A common stock that initially underlie the \n3\n% Green Notes due June 2028, and are expected generally to reduce potential dilution to holders of our common stock upon any conversion of the \n3\n% Green Notes due June 2028 and at our election (subject to certain conditions), offset any cash payments we would be required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted \n3\n% Green Notes due June 2028.\nThe Capped Calls expire on June 1, 2028, and are exercisable only at maturity, but may be early terminated in various circumstances, including if the \n3\n% Green Notes due June 2028 are early converted or repurchased. The default settlement method for the Capped Calls is net share settlement. However, we may elect to settle the Capped Calls in cash.\nThe Capped Calls have an initial strike price of approximately $\n18.85\n per share of Class A common stock, subject to certain adjustments. The strike price of $\n18.85\n corresponds to the initial conversion price of the \n3\n% Green Notes due June 2028. The number of shares underlying the Capped Calls is \n33,549,508\n shares of Class A common stock. The cap price of the \n 111\nCapped Calls is initially $\n26.46\n per share of Class A common stock, which represents a premium of \n100\n% over the last reported sale price of our common stock on May 11, 2023.\nThe Capped Calls are freestanding financial instruments. We used a portion of the proceeds from the issuance of the \n3\n% Green Notes due June 2028 to pay for the Capped Calls’ premium. As the Capped Calls meet certain accounting criteria, they are recorded in stockholders’ equity and are not accounted for as derivatives. The cost of $\n54.5\n million incurred to purchase the Capped Calls was recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital on our consolidated balance sheets and will not be remeasured.\n2.5\n% Green Convertible Senior Notes due August 2025\nIn August 2020, we issued the \n2.5\n%\n\nGreen Convertible Senior Notes due August 2025 (the “\n2.5\n% Green Notes”) in an aggregate principal amount of $\n230.0\n million, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted, less an initial purchaser’s discount of $\n6.9\n million and other issuance costs of $\n3.0\n million (together, the “\n2.5\n% Green Notes Transaction Costs”), resulting in net proceeds of $\n220.1\n million. The \n2.5\n% Green Notes were issued pursuant to, and are governed by, an indenture, dated as of August 11, 2020, between us and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the “\n2.5\n% Green Notes Indenture”),\nThe \n2.5\n% Green Notes are senior, unsecured obligations accruing interest at a rate of\n\n2.5\n% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, beginning on February 15, 2021.\nWe may elect to redeem, at face value, all or any portion of the \n2.5\n% Green Notes at any time on or after August 21, 2023, and on or before the twenty-sixth trading day immediately before the maturity date, provided certain conditions are met. In December 2024, the optional redemption feature of the \n2.5\n% Green Notes was satisfied as the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock exceeded \n130\n% of the conversion price on each of at least \n20\n trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the \n30\n consecutive trading day period. However, we did not issue a notice of redemption as of December 31, 2024.\nBefore May 15, 2025, the noteholders have the right to convert their \n2.5\n% Green Notes only upon the occurrence of certain events, including satisfaction of a condition relating to the closing price of our common stock (the “\n2.5\n% Green Notes Closing Price Condition”). If the \n2.5\n% Green Notes Closing Price Condition is met on at least \n20\n of the last \n30\n consecutive trading days in any quarter, the noteholders may convert their \n2.5\n% Green Notes at any time during the immediately following quarter. The \n2.5\n% Green Notes Closing Price Condition was not met during the three months ended September 30, 2024, and accordingly, the noteholders could not convert their \n2.5\n% Green Notes during the quarter ended December 31, 2024. From and after May 15, 2025, the noteholders may convert their \n2.5\n% Green Notes at any time at their election until the close of business on the second trading day immediately before the maturity date. Should the noteholders elect to convert their \n2.5\n% Green Notes, we may elect to settle the conversion by paying or delivering, as applicable, cash, shares of our Class A common stock or a combination thereof.\nThe initial conversion rate is 61.6808 shares of Class A common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes, which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $\n16.21\n per share of Class A common stock. The conversion rate and conversion price are subject to customary adjustments upon the occurrence of certain events. In addition, if certain corporate events that constitute a “Make-Whole Fundamental Change”, as defined in the \n2.5\n% Green Notes Indenture, occur, the conversion rate applicable to the conversion of the \n2.5\n% Green Notes may, in certain circumstances, be increased by up to 15.4202 shares of Class A common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes for a specified period of time. \nOn May 29, 2024, we used approximately $\n141.8\n million of the net proceeds from the \n3\n% Green Notes due June 2029 offering to repurchase $\n115.0\n million of the outstanding principal amount of our \n2.5\n% Green Notes in privately negotiated transactions. Half of the original principal balance, $\n115.0\n million of the \n2.5\n% Green Notes, was called and repurchased at \n122.6\n% during the second quarter of fiscal year 2024. The \n22.6\n% premium of $\n26.0\n million and unpaid accrued interest of $\n0.8\n million related to the repurchased amount were included in the final payment to the noteholders. As a result of the partial repurchase of the \n2.5\n% Green Notes, we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $\n27.2\n million.\nOn December 31, 2024, and 2023, the maximum number of shares into which the \n2.5\n% Green Notes could have been potentially converted if the conversion features were triggered was \n8,866,615\n and \n17,733,230\n shares of Class A common stock, respectively.\nThe \n2.5\n% Green Notes Transaction Costs were recorded as debt issuance costs and presented a reduction to the \n2.5\n% Green Notes on our consolidated balance sheets and were amortized to interest expense at an effective interest rate of \n3.5\n% before the partial repurchase. The effective interest rate of the \n2.5\n% Green Notes after the partial repurchase was \n3.3\n%.\n 112\nThe total interest expense recognized related to the \n2.5\n% Green Notes for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, was $\n5.5\n million, $\n7.7\n million, and $\n7.7\n million, respectively, and was comprised of contractual interest expense of $\n4.1\n million, $\n5.7\n million, and $\n5.7\n million and amortization of issuance costs of $\n1.4\n million, $\n2.0\n million, and $\n2.0\n million, respectively. We have not recognized any special interest expense related to the \n2.5\n% Green Notes to date. The amount of unamortized debt issuance costs as of December 31, 2024, and 2023, was $\n0.6\n million and $\n3.2\n million, respectively.\nAlthough the \n2.5\n% Green Notes contain embedded conversion features, we account for the \n2.5\n% Green Notes in its entirety as a liability. As of December 31, 2024, and 2023, the net carrying value of the \n2.5\n% Green Notes was classified as a short-term liability and as a long-term liability in our consolidated balance sheets, respectively.\nNon-recourse Debt Facilities\n4.6\n% Term Loans due April 2026 and October 2026\nOn April 11, 2023, and October 5, 2023, Korean JV entered into \nthree-year\n $\n1.5\n million and \nthree-year\n $\n3.1\n million credit agreements with SK ecoplant, respectively, to help fund its working capital. Both loans bear a fixed interest rate of \n4.6\n% payable upon maturity along with the principal. Neither loan requires us to maintain a debt service reserve.\nRepayment Schedule and Interest Expense\nThe following table presents details of our outstanding loan principal repayment schedule as of December 31, 2024 (in thousands):\n2025\n$\n115,000\n\n2026\n4,057\n\n2027\n—\n\n2028\n632,500\n\n2029\n402,500\n\nThereafter\n—\n\n$\n1,154,057\n\nInterest expense of $\n62.6\n million, $\n108.3\n million, and $\n53.5\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, was recorded in interest expense on the consolidated statements of operations. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2023, included $\n52.8\n million as a result of the SK ecoplant Second Tranche Closing. For additional information, please see Note 17 — \nSK ecoplant Strategic Investment\n.\n8. \nLeases\nFacilities, Energy Server Systems, and Vehicles\nWe lease most of our facilities, the Energy Server systems, and vehicles under operating and finance leases that expire at various dates through November 2037. We lease various manufacturing facilities in California and Delaware. We lease additional office space as field offices in the U.S. and around the world including in India, Germany, Ireland, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Taiwan, China, and Singapore.\nSome of the lease arrangements have free rent periods or escalating rent payment provisions. We recognize lease cost under such arrangements on a straight-line basis over the life of the leases. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, rent expenses for all occupied facilities were $\n22.4\n million, $\n23.0\n million and $\n21.4\n million, respectively.\nAt inception of the contract, we assess whether a contract is a lease based on whether the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Lease classification, measurement, and recognition are determined at lease commencement, which is the date the underlying asset is available for use by us. The accounting classification of a lease is based on whether the arrangement is effectively a financed purchase of the underlying asset (financing lease) or not (operating lease). Our operating leases are comprised primarily of leases for facilities, the Energy Server systems, office buildings, and vehicles, and our financing leases are comprised primarily of vehicles.\n 113\nOur leases have lease terms ranging from less than \n1\n year to \n15\n years, some of which include options to extend the leases. The lease term is the non-cancelable period of the lease and includes options to extend the lease when it is reasonably certain that an option will be exercised.\nLease liabilities are measured at the lease commencement date as the present value of future lease payments. Lease right-of-use assets are measured as the lease liability plus unamortized initial direct costs and prepaid (accrued) lease payments less unamortized balance lease incentives received. In measuring the present value of the future lease payments, the discount rate for the lease is the rate implicit in the lease unless that rate cannot be readily determined. In that case, the lessee is required to use its IBR. In computing our lease liabilities, we use the IBR based on the information available on the commencement date using an estimate of company-specific rate in the U.S. on a collateralized basis and consistent with the lease term for each lease. The lease term is the non-cancelable period of the lease and includes options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that an option will be exercised.\nOperating and financing lease right-of-use assets and lease liabilities as of December 31, 2024, and 2023, were as follows (in thousands):\nYears Ended\nDecember 31,\n2024\n2023\nOperating Leases:\nOperating lease right-of-use assets, net \n1, 2\n$\n122,489\n\n$\n139,732\n\nCurrent operating lease liabilities\n(\n19,642\n)\n(\n20,245\n)\nNon-current operating lease liabilities\n(\n124,523\n)\n(\n141,939\n)\nTotal operating lease liabilities\n(\n144,165\n)\n(\n162,184\n)\nFinance Leases:\nFinance lease right-of-use assets, net \n2, 3, 4\n3,214\n\n2,708\n\nCurrent finance lease liabilities\n 5\n(\n981\n)\n(\n1,072\n)\nNon-current finance lease liabilities \n6\n(\n2,450\n)\n(\n1,837\n)\nTotal finance lease liabilities\n(\n3,431\n)\n(\n2,909\n)\nTotal lease liabilities\n$\n(\n147,596\n)\n$\n(\n165,093\n)\n1\n These assets primarily include leases for facilities, the Energy Server systems, and vehicles.\n2\n Net of accumulated amortization.\n3\n These assets primarily include leases for vehicles.\n4\n Included in property, plant and equipment, net in the consolidated balance sheets.\n5\n Included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\n6\n Included in other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\n 114\nThe components of our lease costs for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, were as follows (in thousands):\nYears Ended\nDecember 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nOperating lease costs\n$\n35,814\n\n$\n33,190\n\n$\n25,503\n\nFinancing lease costs:\nAmortization of right-of-use assets\n675\n\n891\n\n968\n\nInterest on lease liabilities\n263\n\n273\n\n220\n\nTotal financing lease costs\n938\n\n1,164\n\n1,188\n\nShort-term lease costs\n98\n\n517\n\n974\n\nTotal lease costs\n$\n36,850\n\n$\n34,871\n\n$\n27,665\n\nWeighted average remaining lease terms and discount rates for our leases as of December 31, 2024, and 2023, were as follows:\nDecember 31,\n2024\n2023\nWeighted average remaining lease term:\nOperating leases\n6.7\n years\n7.4\n years\nFinance leases\n3.7\n years\n3.2\n years\nWeighted average discount rate:\nOperating leases\n10.6\n\n%\n10.6\n\n%\nFinance leases\n9.2\n\n%\n9.5\n\n%\nFuture lease payments under lease agreements as of December 31, 2024, were as follows (in thousands):\nOperating Leases\nFinance Leases\n2025\n$\n33,295\n\n$\n1,255\n\n2026\n33,158\n\n1,036\n\n2027\n32,675\n\n875\n\n2028\n26,793\n\n546\n\n2029\n20,056\n\n317\n\nThereafter\n59,268\n\n—\n\nTotal minimum lease payments\n205,245\n\n4,029\n\nLess: amounts representing interest or imputed interest\n(\n61,080\n)\n(\n598\n)\nPresent value of lease liabilities\n$\n144,165\n\n$\n3,431\n\nManaged Services Financing\nCertain of our customers enter into Managed Services Financing to finance their lease of Bloom Energy Server systems. Customer arrangements under Managed Services Financing entered into after January 1, 2020, do not contain a lease under ASC 842 and are accounted for under ASC 606 as revenue arrangements.\nLease agreements under our Managed Services Financing include non-cancellable lease terms, during which terms the majority of our investment in the Energy Server systems under lease are typically recovered. We mitigate the remaining residual value risk of the Energy Server systems through provision of maintenance on the Energy Server systems during the lease term and through insurance which proceeds are payable in the event of theft, loss, damage, or destruction.\n 115\nOur Managed Services Financing with financiers that result in failed sale-and-leaseback transactions are accounted for as financing transactions. Payments received from the financier are recognized as financing obligations in our consolidated balance sheets. Proceeds from the financiers in excess of fair value of the Energy Server systems under successful sale-and-leaseback transactions are also accounted for as financing obligations. These financing obligations are included in each agreement’s contract value and are recognized as short-term or long-term financing obligations based on the estimated payment dates. The lease agreements expire on various dates through 2034. For successful sale-and-leaseback transactions, we record operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities and record operating lease expenses over the lease term.\nWe recognized $\n9.4\n million, $\n28.7\n million, and $\n20.4\n million of product revenue, and $\n4.5\n million, $\n8.4\n million, and $\n11.3\n million of installation revenue from successful sale-and-leaseback transactions for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. The recognized operating lease expense from successful sale-and-leaseback transactions for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, was $\n12.8\n million, $\n9.7\n million, and $\n5.6\n million, respectively.\nOperating lease right-of-use assets from successful sale-and-leaseback transactions as of December 31, 2024, and 2023, were $\n47.2\n million and $\n47.6\n million, respectively. Operating lease liability from successful sale-and-leaseback transactions as of December 31, 2024, and 2023, was $\n50.4\n million and $\n50.1\n million, including long-term operating lease liability of $\n42.1\n million and $\n43.7\n million, respectively. Financing obligations from successful sale-and-leaseback transactions as of December 31, 2024, and 2023, were $\n11.0\n million and $\n10.9\n million, including long-term financing obligations of $\n8.9\n million and $\n9.3\n million, respectively.\nAt December 31, 2024, future lease payments under the Managed Services Agreements financing obligations were as follows (in thousands):\nFinancing Obligations\n2025\n$\n29,571\n\n2026\n23,447\n\n2027\n17,576\n\n2028\n11,913\n\n2029\n7,267\n\nThereafter\n19,647\n\nTotal minimum lease payments\n109,421\n\nLess: imputed interest\n(\n54,123\n)\nPresent value of net minimum lease payments\n55,298\n\nLess: current financing obligations\n(\n11,702\n)\nLong-term financing obligations\n$\n43,596\n\nThe total financing obligations, as reflected in our consolidated balance sheets, were $\n255.8\n million and $\n444.8\n million as of December 31, 2024, and 2023, respectively. We expect the difference between these obligations and the principal obligations in the table above to be offset against the carrying value of the related Energy Server systems at the end of the lease and the remainder recognized as either a net gain or net loss at that point. For the years ended December 31, 2024, and 2023, we recognized a $\n17.4\n million net gain and $\n0.4\n million net loss on failed sale-and-leaseback transactions in other income (expense), net on our consolidated statements of operations, respectively.\n9. \nStock-Based Compensation and Employee Benefit Plans\nShare-based grants are designed to reward employees for their long-term contributions to us and provide incentives for them to remain with us. \n2012 Equity Incentive Plan\nOur 2012 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2012 Plan”) was approved in August 2012. The 2012 Plan provided for the grant \n 116\nof incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options, stock appreciation rights and RSUs, all of which may be granted to employees, including officers, and to non-employee directors and consultants except we may grant incentive stock options only to employees.\nGrants under the 2012 Plan generally vest ratably over a \nfour-year\n period from the vesting commencement date and expire \nten years\n from the grant date. As of December 31, 2024, and 2023, stock options to purchase of \n3,691,919\n and \n4,511,074\n shares of Class A common stock were outstanding with a weighted average exercise price of $\n27.38\n and $\n27.28\n per share, respectively, and \nno\n shares were available for future grant. The 2012 Equity Incentive Plan has been canceled but continues to govern outstanding option grants under the 2012 Plan.\n2018 Equity Incentive Plan\nThe 2018 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2018 Plan”) was approved in April 2018. The 2018 Plan became effective upon our initial public offering (“IPO”) and serves as the successor to the 2012 Plan. The 2018 Plan authorizes the award of stock options, restricted stock awards, stock appreciation rights, RSUs, PSUs and stock bonuses. The 2018 Plan provides for the grant of awards to employees, directors, consultants, independent contractors and advisors provided the consultants, independent contractors, directors and advisors render services not in connection with the offer and sale of securities in a capital-raising transaction. The exercise price of stock options is at least equal to the fair market value of Class A common stock on the date of grant. Grants under the 2018 Plan generally vest ratably over \nthree\n or \nfour years\n from the vesting commencement date and expire \nten years\n from the grant date. \nThe 2018 Plan allows for an annual increase on January 1, of each of 2019 through 2028, by the lesser of (a) four percent (\n4\n%) of the number of Class A common stock and common stock equivalents (including options, RSUs, warrants and preferred stock on an as-converted basis) issued and outstanding on each December 31 immediately prior to the date of increase, and (b) such number of shares determined by the Board of Directors.\nAs of December 31, 2024, and 2023, stock options to purchase \n3,740,902\n and \n2,736,550\n shares of Class A common stock were outstanding, respectively, with a weighted average exercise price of $\n10.14\n and $\n10.42\n per share, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, and 2023, \n12,896,465\n and \n9,887,706\n RSUs and PSUs that may be settled for Class A common stock, which were granted pursuant to the 2018 Plan, respectively, were outstanding. As of December 31, 2024, and 2023, we had \n35,263,475\n and \n32,877,906\n shares reserved for issuance under the 2018 Plan, respectively.\nStock-Based Compensation Expense\nThe following table summarizes the components of stock-based compensation expense in the consolidated statements of operations (in thousands):\n\nYears Ended\nDecember 31,\n\n2024\n2023\n2022\nCost of revenue\n$\n16,579\n\n$\n17,504\n\n$\n18,955\n\nResearch and development\n22,150\n\n27,620\n\n33,956\n\nSales and marketing\n11,224\n\n16,415\n\n18,651\n\nGeneral and administrative\n33,042\n\n25,556\n\n42,404\n\n$\n82,995\n\n$\n87,095\n\n$\n113,966\n\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, stock-based compensation expense capitalized on inventory and deferred cost of goods sold was immaterial.\n 117\nStock Option and Stock Award Activity\nStock Options\nThe following table summarizes the stock option activity under our stock plans during the reporting period:\n\nOutstanding Options\n\nNumber of\nShares\nWeighted\nAverage\nExercise\nPrice\nRemaining\nContractual\nLife (Years)\nAggregate\nIntrinsic\nValue\n\n(in thousands)\nBalances at December 31, 2022\n8,748,309\n\n$\n20.70\n\n4.6\n$\n40,532\n\nExercised\n(\n525,031\n)\n6.76\n\nForfeited / Expired\n(\n975,654\n)\n26.58\n\nBalances at December 31, 2023\n7,247,624\n\n20.93\n\n3.8\n19,446\n\nExercised\n(\n307,857\n)\n7.01\n\nGranted\n1,364,348\n\n9.96\n\nForfeited / Expired\n(\n871,294\n)\n27.45\n\nBalances at December 31, 2024\n7,432,821\n\n18.72\n\n4.1\n53,453\n\nVested and expected to vest at December 31, 2024\n7,143,140\n\n19.09\n\n3.9\n49,764\n\nExercisable at December 31, 2024\n6,093,473\n\n$\n20.65\n\n3.0\n$\n37,014\n\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we recognized $\n3.2\n million, $\n0.4\n million and $\n7.1\n million of stock-based compensation costs for stock options, respectively.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, we granted \n1,364,348\n stock options, including \n1,135,000\n stock options granted to certain executives to purchase shares of common stock that contain certain performance-based vesting criteria related to corporate milestones (the “performance-based stock options”). The performance-based stock options were granted “at-the-money” and have a term of \n10\n years. The performance-based stock options vest based over a \nthree-year\n or a \nfour-year\n requisite service period. We did \nno\nt grant options in the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022.\nWe used the following weighted-average assumptions in applying the Black-Scholes valuation model for determination of the stock options valuation:\nRisk-free interest rate\n3.7\n% - \n4.4\n%\nExpected term (years)\n6\n years\nExpected dividend yield\n—\nExpected volatility\n95.3\n% - \n97.1\n%\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the intrinsic value of stock options exercised was $\n2.1\n million, $\n3.6\n million and $\n3.8\n million, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2024, and 2023, we had unrecognized compensation costs related to unvested stock options of $\n7.2\n million and $\n0.1\n million, respectively. This cost is expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted-average period of \n2.1\n years and \n0.3\n years, respectively. Cash received from stock options exercised totaled $\n2.0\n million, $\n3.6\n million and $\n3.7\n million and for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n 118\nStock Awards\nA summary of our stock awards activity and related information is as follows:\nNumber of\nAwards\nOutstanding\nWeighted\nAverage Grant\nDate Fair\nValue\nUnvested Balance at December 31, 2022\n9,549,035\n\n$\n19.99\n\nGranted\n6,369,823\n\n17.33\n\nVested\n(\n4,160,416\n)\n19.55\n\nForfeited\n(\n1,869,101\n)\n21.12\n\nUnvested Balance at December 31, 2023\n9,889,341\n\n$\n18.25\n\nGranted\n8,574,481\n\n15.66\n\nVested\n(\n3,067,129\n)\n19.61\n\nForfeited\n(\n1,350,228\n)\n18.60\n\nCancelled\n(\n1,150,000\n)\n17.44\n\nUnvested Balance at December 31, 2024\n12,896,465\n\n$\n16.29\n\nThe estimated fair value of RSUs and PSUs is based on the fair value of our Class A common stock on the date of grant.

The 2021 PSUs were cancelled due to the lack of their retention value and the change in the Company’s strategic goals. Also, on December 18, 2024, the Company’s board of directors granted the CEO replacement awards that included (1) a front-loaded \nthree-year\n equity award consisting of: (i) \n1,500,000\n PSU awards and (ii) \n500,000\n RSU awards (the “2025 Equity Package”), and (2) a one-time award of \n600,000\n PSU awards (the “One-Time Grant”, and together with the 2025 Equity Package, the “Replacement Awards”).\nThe 2025 Equity Package RSU awards have time-based vesting schedule of \nthree years\n and started vesting on December 18, 2024. The performance criteria under the 2025 Equity Package PSU awards are equally weighted between product revenue growth and adjusted product gross margin. The CEO is eligible to receive up to \n300\n% of the target PSUs under the 2025 Equity Package, which is intended to provide a meaningful retention incentive for the CEO over the next several years. The 2025 Equity Package PSUs have a \nthree-year\n cliff performance vesting period. \nThe One-Time Grant consists of \ntwo\n awards: (i) a grant of \n300,000\n PSUs that fully vested on December 18, 2024, and (ii) a grant of \n300,000\n PSUs that will be earned and vest following the Compensation and Organizational Development Committee’s certification that the CEO has achieved specific, objective criteria tied to strategic priorities prior to December 31, 2027. The maximum amount of shares the CEO can earn under the One-Time Grant is \n600,000\n shares of our Class A common stock.\nThe cancellation of the 2021 PSUs accompanied by the concurrent grant of the Replacement Awards was accounted for as a modification of the terms of the cancelled award according to the ASC 718. On December 18, 2024, the Company determined the incremental compensation cost of $\n42.4\n million measured as the excess of the fair value of the Replacement Awards over the fair value of the cancelled award immediately before the terms were modified. These compensation costs will be recognized over the requisite service period of the Replacement Awards. The total fair value of the Replacement Awards of $\n57.6\n million measured at the date of a cancellation and replacement consisted of (1) the grant-date fair value of the original award for which the service has already been rendered and is expected to be rendered at that date, and (2) the incremental cost resulting from the cancellation and replacement. For the year ended December 31, 2024, we recognized $\n7.6\n million of \n 119\ncompensation costs related to the Replacement Awards.\nOn March 1, 2024, the Company granted RSUs, PSUs, time-based and performance-based stock option awards to certain executive staff; on May 6, 2024, the Company granted RSUs and PSUs to new executive hires, including our new Chief Financial Officer; and on August 29, 2024, the Company granted additional performance-based stock option awards to our Chief Commercial Officer (collectively, the “2024 Executive Awards”), pursuant to the 2018 Plan.\nThe RSUs have time-based vesting schedules that range from \ntwo\n to \nfour years\n, and started vesting on February 15, 2024 (May 15, 2024, for new hires).\nThe time-based stock options started vesting on February 15, 2024, and shall vest over \nthree years\n. The PSUs have vesting schedules that range from \none\n to \nthree years\n. The performance-based stock options have vesting schedules that range from \nthree\n to \nfour years\n. Both the PSUs and the performance-based stock options have a threshold target for vesting of \n50\n% of the number of awards, a target for \n100\n% of earned awards and a maximum of \n150\n% of granted awards earned, for each of the performance periods.\nThe PSUs and performance-based stock options will vest based on a combination of time and achievement against performance metrics targets assuming continued employment and service through each vesting date. Stock-based compensation costs associated with the 2024 Executive Awards are recognized over the service period as we evaluate the probability of the achievement of the performance conditions. As of December 31, 2024, the unamortized compensation expense for the RSUs, the PSUs, the time-based and the performance-based stock options per the 2024 Executive Awards and the Replacement Awards was $\n66.8\n million.\nFiscal Year 2023\nOn February 15, 2023, and July 11, 2023, the Company granted RSU and PSU awards (the “2023 Executive Awards”) to certain executive staff pursuant to the 2018 Plan. The RSU awards have time-based vesting schedules, started vesting on February 15, 2023, and shall vest over a \nthree-year\n period. The PSU awards which started vesting on February 15, 2023, have either a \nthree-year\n or \none-year\n cliff vesting period, and the PSU awards which started vesting on July 11, 2023, cliff vest on February 15, 2024. The PSU awards will vest based on a combination of time and achievement against performance metrics targets assuming continued employment and service through each vesting date. Stock-based compensation costs associated with the 2023 Executive Awards are recognized over the service period as we evaluate the probability of the achievement of the performance conditions. As of December 31, 2024, and 2023, the unamortized compensation expense for the 2023 Executive Awards was $\n1.8\n million and $\n7.0\n million, respectively.\nFiscal Year 2022\nIn 2022, the Company granted RSU and PSU awards (the “2022 Executive Awards”) to certain executive staff, including our CEO, pursuant to the 2018 Plan. The RSUs have time-based vesting schedules. The PSUs consist of \nthree\n vesting tranches during 2023-2025 with an annual vesting schedule based on the attainment of performance conditions related to fiscal year 2022 and assuming continued employment and service through each vesting date. Stock-based compensation costs associated with the 2022 Executive Awards are recognized over the service period. As of December 31, 2024, and 2023, the unamortized compensation expense for the 2022 Executive Awards was $\n1.0\n million and $\n6.2\n million, respectively. Actual compensation expense is determined by the attained performance condition of the PSUs in fiscal year 2022.\nFiscal Year 2021\nIn 2021, the Company granted RSU and PSU awards (the “2021 Executive Awards”) to certain executive staff, other than our Chief Executive Officer, pursuant to the 2018 Plan. The RSUs have time-based vesting schedules. The PSUs consist of annual vesting tranches based on the attainment of performance conditions and assuming continued employment and service through each vesting date. Stock-based compensation costs associated with the 2021 Executive Awards are recognized over the service period as we evaluate the probability of the achievement of the performance conditions.\nIn 2021, the Company also granted RSU and PSU awards to our CEO pursuant to the 2018 Plan. The RSUs will vest in equal annual installments over \nfive years\n from the grant date. A portion of the PSUs can be earned based on achieving certain financial performance goals and another portion can be earned based upon achieving certain progressive stock price hurdles. Any shares issued under the PSU awards will be subject to a \ntwo-year\n post-vest holding period in which the award holder will be restricted from selling any shares (net of shares settled for taxes). \nActual compensation expense is dependent on the performance of the PSUs that vest based upon a performance condition. We estimated the fair value of the PSUs that vest based on a market condition on the date of grant using a Monte \n 120\nCarlo simulation with the following assumptions: (i) expected volatility of \n71.2\n%, (ii) risk-free interest rate of \n1.6\n%, and (iii) \nno\n expected dividend yield.\nOn December 18, 2024, the Company cancelled \n1,150,000\n PSU awards from the 2021 Executive Awards and replaced them with the 2025 Equity Package.\nAs of December 31, 2024, and 2023, the unamortized compensation expense for 2021 Executive Awards was $\n3.7\n million, and $\n8.2\n million, respectively.\nThe following table presents the stock activity and the total number of shares available for grant under our stock plans:\n\nPlan Shares Available\nfor Grant\n\nBalances at December 31, 2022\n28,340,641\n\nAdded to plan\n8,948,255\n\nGranted\n(\n6,290,060\n)\nCancelled/Forfeited\n2,774,990\n\nExpired\n(\n895,920\n)\nBalances at December 31, 2023\n32,877,906\n\nAdded to plan\n9,674,114\n\nGranted\n(\n9,933,957\n)\nCancelled/Forfeited\n3,371,522\n\nExpired\n(\n726,110\n)\nBalances at December 31, 2024\n35,263,475\n\n2018 Employee Stock Purchase Plan\nIn April 2018, we adopted the 2018 ESPP. The 2018 ESPP became effective upon our IPO in July 2018. The 2018 ESPP is intended to qualify under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. The aggregate number of our shares that may be issued over the term of our ESPP is \n33,333,333\n Class A common stock. A total of \n3,333,333\n shares of our Class A common stock were initially reserved for issuance under the plan. The number of shares reserved for issuance under the 2018 ESPP will increase automatically on the 1st day of January of each of the first \nnine years\n following the first offering date by the number of shares equal to one percent (\n1\n%) of the total number of Class A common stock, Class B common stock (automatically converted to Class A common stock on July 27, 2023) and common stock equivalents (including options, RSUs, warrants and preferred stock on an as converted basis) issued and outstanding on the immediately preceding December 31 (rounded down to the nearest whole share); provided, that the Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee may in its sole discretion reduce the amount of the increase in any particular year. \nThe 2018 ESPP allows eligible employees to purchase shares, subject to purchase limits of \n2,500\n shares during each \nsix-month\n period or $\n25,000\n worth of stock for each calendar year, of our Class A common stock through payroll deductions at a price per share equal to \n85\n% of the lesser of the fair market value of our Class A common stock (i) on the first trading day of the applicable offering date and (ii) the last trading day of each purchase date.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we recognized $\n5.9\n million, $\n15.5\n million and $\n16.2\n million of stock-based compensation costs for the 2018 ESPP, respectively. We issued \n1,049,955\n, \n875,695\n and \n759,744\n shares in the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we added an additional \n2,418,528\n, \n2,239,563\n and \n12,055,792\n shares, respectively. There were \n16,573,157\n and \n15,204,584\n shares available for issuance as of December 31, 2024, and 2023, respectively. \nAs of December 31, 2024, and 2023, we had $\n5.9\n million and $\n8.8\n million of unrecognized stock-based compensation costs, expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of \n0.8\n years and \n0.8\n years, respectively.\n 121\nWe used the following weighted-average assumptions in applying the Black-Scholes valuation model for determination of the 2018 ESPP share valuation:\nYears Ended\nDecember 31,\n2024\n2023\nRisk-free interest rate\n\n4.1\n% - \n5.6\n%\n4.9\n% - \n5.6\n%\nExpected term (years)\n0.5\n - \n2.0\n0.5\n - \n2.0\nExpected dividend yield\n—\n—\nExpected volatility\n54.1\n% - \n78.7\n%\n54.1\n% - \n74.1\n%\n10. \nPortfolio Financings\nOverview\nWe have developed various financing options that enable customers’ use of the Energy Server systems through third-party ownership financing arrangements. \nIn the past, we and our third-party equity investors (together, the “Equity Investors”) contributed funds into a limited liability investment entity (the “Investment Company”) that owns and is parent to the Operating Company (together, the “PPA Entities”). The contributed funds were restricted for use by the Operating Company to the purchase of our Energy Server systems manufactured by us in our normal course of operations. All \nsix\n PPA Entities established in the past utilized their entire available financing capacity and have completed the purchase of their Energy Server systems. Any debt incurred by the Operating Companies was non-recourse to us. Under these structures, each Investment Company was treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Equity Investors received investment tax credits and accelerated tax depreciation benefits.\nIn June 2022, November 2022, and August 2023, we sold PPA IIIa, PPA IV, and PPA V, respectively, which were accounted as our consolidated VIEs, as a result of the repowering of the Energy Server systems. The other three PPA Entities — PPA II, PPA IIIb and PPA VI — are not considered VIEs (the Third-Party PPAs). \nPPA IIIa Repowering of the Energy Server Systems\nPPA IIIa was established in 2012 and we, through a special purpose subsidiary (the “Project Company”), had previously entered into certain agreements for the purpose of developing, financing, owning, operating, maintaining and managing a portfolio of \n9.8\n megawatts of the Energy Server systems. \n On March 31, 2022, we entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the “MIPA”) where we bought out the equity interest of the third-party investor, wherein the PPA IIIa became wholly owned by us (the “PPA IIIa Buyout”). \nFollowing the PPA IIIa Buyout and prior to June 14, 2022, we repaid all outstanding debt of the Project Company of $\n30.6\n million, and recognized loss on extinguishment of debt in an amount of $\n4.2\n million, which includes the write-off of the debt discount related to warrants of $\n1.8\n million and a make-whole payment of $\n2.4\n million associated with the debt extinguishment.\nOn June 14, 2022, we sold our \n100\n% interest in the Project Company to the financier through the MIPA. Simultaneously, we entered into an agreement with the Project Company to repower the old \n9.8\n megawatts of the old PPA IIIa Energy Servers by replacing them with the new PPA IIIa Energy Servers and providing related installation services, which were financed by the financier (the “EPC Agreement”). The plan was to remove the old PPA IIIa Energy Servers prior to installing the new PPA IIIa Energy Servers and return the old PPA IIIa Energy Servers to Bloom. We also amended and restated our O&M Agreement with the Project Company to cover all the new PPA IIIa Energy Servers and the old PPA IIIa Energy Servers prior to their repowering. The operations and maintenance fees under the O&M Agreement are paid on a fixed dollar per kilowatt basis.\nCertain power purchase agreements within the PPA IIIa portfolio were classified as sales-type leases under ASC 840, while some were classified as operating leases. We elected the practical expedient package with the adoption of ASC 842, which allowed us to carry forward the lease classification upon adoption of ASC 842 on January 1, 2020. The leases were \n 122\nmodified prior to the sale of PPA IIIa to the financier. Such modified leases were reassessed and determined to not be leases under ASC 842 because customers have no control over the identified assets. Accordingly, on the date of modification, the customer financing receivables were derecognized and recognized as property, plant, and equipment (the “PPA IIIa PP&E”). \nDue to our repurchase option on the old PPA IIIa Energy Servers, we concluded there was no transfer of control of the old PPA IIIa Energy Servers upon sale of the membership interest to the financier. Accordingly, we continued to recognize the old PPA IIIa Energy Servers, despite the legal ownership of such assets under the MIPA. Upon reclassification of the lease assets to property, plant and equipment, net, we assessed the recorded assets for impairment. The carrying amount of the PPA IIIa PP&E was determined to be not recoverable as the net undiscounted cash flows were less than the carrying amounts for PPA IIIa PP&E. Therefore, we recognized the asset impairment charge as electricity cost, consistent with depreciation expense classification for property, plant and equipment under leases. \nThe PPA IIIa Repowering was completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022. It resulted in the following summarized impacts on our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2024: (i) service revenue recognized of $\n2.3\n million related to the O&M Agreements, (ii) \nimmaterial\n amount of cost of installation revenue recognized.\nThe PPA IIIa Repowering resulted in the following summarized impacts on our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023: (i) service revenue recognized of $\n3.5\n million related to the O&M Agreements, (ii) installation revenue recognized of $\n0.4\n million, and (iii) cost of installation revenue of $\n0.1\n million. The PPA IIIa Repowering had the following impacts on our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022: (i) product, installation and service revenue recognized of $\n49.8\n million, $\n4.6\n million, and $\n0.7\n million, respectively, as a result of the sale of the new PPA IIIa Energy Servers; (ii) cost of electricity revenue of $\n45.0\n million, including the impairment of the old PPA IIIa Energy Servers of $\n44.8\n million and accelerated depreciation of $\n0.2\n million prior to the completion of installation; (iii) cost of product and installation revenue of $\n21.8\n million and $\n3.2\n million, respectively, due to the sale of the new PPA IIIa Energy Servers; and (iv) $\n4.2\n million of loss on extinguishment of debt. \nImpacts on our consolidated statements of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022, are summarized as follows: net cash provided by financing activities decreased by $\n32.6\n million due to the repayment of debt of $\n30.2\n million and cash fee of $\n2.4\n million associated with debt extinguishment. There were \nno\n impacts on cash flows from financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2024, and 2023.\nPPA IV Repowering of the Energy Server Systems\nPPA IV was established in 2014 and we, through the Project Company, had previously entered into certain agreements for the purpose of developing, financing, owning, operating, maintaining and managing a portfolio of \n19.3\n megawatts of the Energy Server systems. \n On November 2, 2022, we entered into the MIPA where we bought out the equity interest of the third-party investor for $\n4.0\n million, wherein the PPA IV became wholly owned by us (the “PPA IV Buyout”).\nFollowing the PPA IV Buyout and prior to November 22, 2022, we repaid all outstanding debt of the Project Company of $\n70.9\n million and recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt in an amount of $\n4.7\n million, which includes the write-off of the debt discount of $\n0.6\n million and a make-whole payment of $\n4.1\n million associated with the debt extinguishment.\nOn November 22, 2022, we sold our \n100\n% interest in the Project Company to the financier through the MIPA. Simultaneously, we entered into an agreement with the Project Company to repower the \n19.3\n megawatts of the old PPA IV Energy Servers by replacing them with the new PPA IV Energy Servers and providing related installation services, which were financed by the financier under the EPC Agreement. The old PPA IV Energy Servers were removed prior to installing the new PPA IV Energy Servers, whereby upon completion of installation the old PPA IV Energy Servers are returned to Bloom. We also amended and restated our O&M Agreement with the Project Company to cover all the new PPA IV Energy Servers and the old PPA IV Energy Servers prior to their repowering. The operations and maintenance fees under the O&M Agreement are paid on a fixed dollar per kilowatt basis.\nThe power purchase agreements within the PPA IV portfolio were classified as operating leases under ASC 840. We elected the practical expedient package with the adoption of ASC 842, which allowed us to carry forward the lease classification upon adoption of ASC 842 on January 1, 2020. The leases were modified prior to the sale of PPA IV to the financier. Such modified leases were reassessed and determined to not be leases under ASC 842 because customers have no control over the identified assets. Accordingly, on the date of modification, the operating leases were recognized as property, plant, and equipment (the “PPA IV PP&E”). \n 123\nDue to our repurchase option on the old PPA IV Energy Servers, we concluded there was no transfer of control of the old PPA IV Energy Servers upon sale of the membership interest to the financier. Accordingly, we continued to recognize the old PPA IV Energy Servers, despite the legal ownership of such assets under the MIPA. We assessed the recorded assets for impairment. The carrying amount of the PPA IV PP&E was determined to be not recoverable as the net undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amounts for the PPA IV PP&E. Therefore, we recognized the asset impairment charge as electricity cost, consistent with depreciation expense classification for property, plant and equipment under leases. \nThe PPA IV Repowering was completed in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024. It resulted in the following summarized impacts on our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2024: (i) service revenue recognized of $\n2.3\n million related to the O&M Agreements, (ii) product revenue recognized of $\n0.4\n million, (iii) a decrease of cost of installation revenue of $\n0.2\n million due to accrual reversal, and (iv) immaterial amount of installation revenue recognized due to revenue adjustment.\nThe PPA IV Repowering had the following impacts on our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023: (i) installation revenue recognized of $\n10.0\n million, (ii) service revenue recognized of $\n1.8\n million related to the O&M Agreements, (iii) electricity revenue recognized of $\n6.1\n million, (iv) product revenue decreased by $\n3.4\n million due to the revenue adjustment, (v) cost of installation revenue of $\n6.6\n million, and (vi) cost of product revenue of $\n0.1\n million. The PPA IV Repowering had the following impacts on our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022: (i) product and electricity revenue recognized of $\n102.3\n million and $\n1.4\n million, respectively, as a result of the sale of new Energy Servers; (ii) cost of electricity revenue of $\n64.3\n million, including the impairment of old Energy Servers of $\n64.0\n million and accelerated depreciation of $\n0.3\n million prior to the completion of installation; (iii) cost of product revenue of $\n37.4\n million, due to the sale of the new PPA IV Energy Servers; (iv) general and administrative expenses of $\n4.7\n million primarily due to the impairment of prepaid insurance, and; (v) $\n4.7\n million of loss on extinguishment of debt.\nAs a result of the equity interest buyout from the third-party investor, noncontrolling interest related to PPA IV of $\n23.7\n million was eliminated and recorded as part of additional paid-in capital in our consolidated statements of stockholders’ equity (deficit).\nImpacts on our consolidated statements of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022, are summarized as follows: net cash provided by financing activities decreased by $\n74.6\n million due to the repayment of debt of $\n70.5\n million and cash fee of $\n4.1\n million associated with debt extinguishment. There were \nno\n impacts on cash flows from financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2024, and 2023.\nPPA V Interest Buyout\nOn November 2, 2022, we acquired all of Constellation Energy Generation, LLC’s (“Constellation”) interest in PPA V (the “2022 PPA V Buyout”), as set forth in the Purchase and Sale Agreement. The aggregate purchase price of the transaction amounted to $\n8.0\n million. After the acquisition our interest in PPA V increased from \n10\n% to \n70\n%.\nOn August 10, 2023, we acquired all of Solar TC Corp’s (“Intel”) interest in PPA V, as set forth in the Purchase and Sale Agreement (the “2023 PPA V Buyout”). The aggregate purchase price of the transaction amounted to $\n6.9\n million. After the acquisition, PPA V became wholly owned by us.\nThe changes in our ownership interest in PPA V were accounted for as equity transactions in accordance with ASC 810, \nConsolidations\n (“ASC 810”). The carrying amounts of the noncontrolling interest were eliminated to reflect the changes in our ownership interest in PPA V, and the differences between the fair values of the considerations paid and the carrying amounts of the noncontrolling interest immediately prior to the 2022 PPA V Buyout on November 2, 2022, and immediately prior to the 2023 PPA V Buyout on August 10, 2023, of $\n48.1\n million and $\n11.5\n million, respectively, were recognized as additional paid-in capital in our consolidated statements of stockholders’ equity (deficit).\nPPA V Repowering of the Energy Server Systems\nPPA V was established in 2015 and we, through the Project Company, had previously entered into certain agreements for the purpose of developing, financing, owning, operating, maintaining and managing a portfolio of \n37.1\n megawatts of the Energy Server systems.\nOn August 24, 2023, we entered into the MIPA with the financier. Following the 2023 PPA V Buyout and prior to signing the MIPA, we repaid all of the outstanding debt of the Project Company of $\n119.0\n million, including accrued interest of $\n0.5\n million, and recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt in an amount of $\n1.4\n million, represented in its entirety by the \n 124\nderecognition of the related debt issuance costs. Refer to Note 7 — \nOutstanding Loans and Security Agreements\n, \nNon-recourse Debt Facilities\n section.\nOn August 25, 2023, we sold our \n100\n% interest in the Project Company to the financier through the MIPA. Simultaneously, we entered into an agreement with the Project Company to repower the \n37.1\n megawatts of the old PPA V Energy Servers by replacing them with the new PPA V Energy Servers and to provide related installation services, which were financed by the financier (i.e., EPC Agreement). We also amended and restated our O&M Agreement with the Project Company to cover all the new PPA V Energy Servers and the old PPA V Energy Servers prior to their Repowering. The operations and maintenance fees under the O&M Agreement are paid on a fixed dollar per kilowatt basis.\nDue to our repurchase option on the old PPA V Energy Servers, we concluded there was no transfer of control of the old PPA V Energy Servers upon sale of the membership interest to the financier. Accordingly, we continued to recognize the old PPA Energy Servers, despite the legal ownership of such assets having been transferred under the MIPA. We assessed the recorded assets for impairment. The carrying amount of the PPA V property, plant and equipment was determined to be not recoverable as the net undiscounted cash flows were less than the carrying amounts for PPA V property, plant and equipment. Therefore, we recognized the asset impairment charge as electricity cost, consistent with our depreciation expense classification for property, plant and equipment under leases.\nThe PPA V Repowering was complete in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, and resulted in the following summarized impacts on our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2024: (i) service revenue recognized of $\n10.9\n million related to the O&M Agreements, (ii) a decrease in cost of installation revenue of $\n0.8\n million due to accrual reversal, (iii) product revenue decreased by $\n0.1\n million due to the revenue adjustment, and (iv) immaterial amount of installation revenue recognized.\nThe PPA V Repowering had the following impacts on our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023: (i) product revenue and installation revenue recognized of $\n176.2\n million and $\n14.8\n million, respectively, as a result of the sale of the new PPA V Energy Servers; (ii) electricity revenue recognized of $\n6.1\n million related to the old PPA V Energy Servers and the release of deferred incentive revenue of $\n5.0\n million, (iii) service revenue recognized of $\n2.6\n million related to the O&M Agreements, (iv) cost of electricity revenue of $\n125.6\n million, primarily including the impairment of the old PPA V Energy Servers of $\n123.7\n million and accelerated depreciation of $\n0.4\n million prior to the completion of installation; (v) cost of product revenue and cost of installation revenue of $\n75.3\n million and $\n13.2\n million, respectively, due to the sale of the new PPA V Energy Servers; (vi) general and administrative expenses of $\n6.4\n million due to the impairment of non-recoverable production insurance; (vii) loss on extinguishment of debt of $\n1.4\n million, (viii) interest expense of $\n0.3\n million, and (ix) net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest of $\n1.0\n million.\nImpacts on our consolidated statements of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2023, are summarized as follows: net cash provided by financing activities decreased by $\n109.3\n million due to the repayment of debt related to PPA V of $\n118.5\n million, and acquisition of all of interest in PPA V from Intel for $\n6.9\n million net of distributions to Intel’s noncontrolling interest of $\n2.3\n million. There were \nno\n impacts on cash flows from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nAssets Buyout and Repowering\nIn December 2024, we terminated certain of our legacy managed services agreements, previously recorded as failed sale and lease-back transactions upon inception. At termination, we bought back the old Energy Server systems from the respective legacy financiers (the “Buyout”). Upon the Buyout, title for these Energy Server systems was transferred to a Bloom-owned SPV. The SPV was a VIE of Bloom under ASC 810, and we consolidated it in our financial statements as we were the primary beneficiary and therefore had the power to direct activities which were most significant to this entity.\nSimultaneously with the Buyout, we sold our \n100\n% interest in the SPV to the new financier. Upon the sale, the SPV is no longer a part of our consolidated financial statements. We also entered into two agreements with the New Project Company: (1) the EPC Agreement to repower its fleet of the old Energy Server systems by replacing them with the new Energy Server systems and to provide related installation services, which was financed by the new financier (the “old Energy Server systems Repowering”); and (2) the O&M Agreement for the operations and maintenance of the new Energy Server systems with fees payable on a fixed dollar per kilowatt basis. The old Energy Server systems Repowering was scheduled for the first half of fiscal year 2025.\nAt the time of the Buyout, we assessed the old Energy Server systems for impairment. As a result, the carrying amount of the assets, recorded as property, plant and equipment on our consolidated balance sheet, was adjusted to $\n1.5\n million, to represent the new remaining useful life. The asset impairment charge of $\n74.4\n million, along with the amount of the Buyout of \n 125\n$\n59.4\n million, net of refund received from the financier, was offset against the \ngain from derecognition of financing obligations\n related to the terminated legacy managed services agreements of $\n146.2\n million, and the net effect of $\n12.4\n million was recorded in other income (expense), net on our consolidated statements of operations (see Note 8 — \nLeases\n).\nUnder the EPC Agreement, Bloom has a right to repurchase the old Energy Server systems. Due to such repurchase right, we concluded there was no transfer of control of the old Energy Server systems upon sale of the SPV to the new financier. Consequently, the sale of the old Energy Server systems was recorded as a sales-type lease. Accordingly, we derecognized the old Energy Server systems with the carrying amount of $\n1.5\n million, as determined at the time of the Buyout, resulting in the selling profit from the sales-type lease of $\n3.6\n million, which was recorded in other income (expense), net on our consolidated statements of operations. Instead of recording the respective lease receivable for the sales-type lease, we adjusted customer deposits received from the new financier as part of the EPC Agreement by $\n5.1\n million. The sales-type lease will have a term ending upon completion of the old Energy Server systems Repowering, which is expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter of fiscal year 2025.\n11. \nRelated Party Transactions\nOn September 23, 2023, all \n13,491,701\n shares of the Series B RCPS (i.e., the Second Tranche Shares) were automatically converted into shares of our Class A common stock. For more information on the Second Tranche Closing, see Note 17 — \nSK ecoplant Strategic Investment\n. Consequently, SK ecoplant became a principal owner of an aggregate of \n23,491,701\n shares of our Class A common stock, including (i) \n10,000,000\n shares held with sole voting and investment power (as a result of the conversion of \n10,000,000\n shares of our Series A preferred stock, par value $\n0.0001\n per share (the “Series A RCPS”) into \n10,000,000\n shares of our Class A common stock on November 8, 2022) and (ii) \n13,491,701\n shares held with shared voting and investing power with Econovation, LLC, \n51.67\n% and \n48.33\n% of which is owned by SK ecoplant and Blooming Green Energy Limited, respectively, as the assignee of the Second Tranche Shares. SK ecoplant is considered to be a related party as of September 23, 2023, and became entitled to nominate a member to the Board of Directors of Bloom. As of December 31, 2024, and 2023, SK ecoplant’s beneficial ownership of our Class A common stock represented \n10.3\n% and \n10.5\n% of our outstanding Class A common stock, respectively.\nOur operations included the following related party transactions (in thousands):\n\nYears Ended\nDecember 31,\n\n2024\n2023\n2022\nTotal revenue from related parties\n1\n$\n338,602\n\n$\n487,240\n\n$\n36,281\n\nCost of product revenue\n2\n163\n\n133\n\n—\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses\n3\n683\n\n812\n\n—\n\nInterest expense\n4\n203\n\n84\n\n—\n\n1\n\nTotal revenue from related parties for the years ended December 31, 2024, and 2023, includes revenue from (a) Korean JV and (b) SK ecoplant, which became a related party on September 23, 2023; however, we had transactions with SK ecoplant in prior periods (see Note 17 — SK ecoplant Strategic Investment). Revenue from related parties for the year ended December 31, 2022, relate to Korean JV in its entirety.\n2\n\nIncludes expenses billed by SK ecoplant to Korean JV for headcount support, maintenance and other services.\n3\n\nIncludes rent expenses per operating lease agreements entered between Korean JV and SK ecoplant and miscellaneous expenses billed by SK ecoplant to Korean JV.\n4\n\nInterest expense per \ntwo\n term loans entered into between Korean JV and SK ecoplant in fiscal year 2023 (see Note 7 — \nOutstanding Loans and Security Agreements\n).\n 126\nBelow is the summary of outstanding related party balances as of December 31, 2024, and 2023 (in thousands):\n\nDecember 31,\n2024\n2023\n\nAccounts receivable\n$\n93,510\n\n$\n262,031\n\nContract assets\n800\n\n6,872\n\nDeferred cost of revenue, current\n—\n\n875\n\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets (Note 17)\n1,215\n\n2,257\n\nOperating lease right-of-use assets\n1\n1,385\n\n2,031\n\nOther long-term assets (Note 17)\n8,776\n\n9,069\n\nAccounts payable\n—\n\n77\n\nAccrued warranty\n1,205\n\n1,260\n\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities\n3,989\n\n3,427\n\nDeferred revenue and customer deposits, current\n8,857\n\n1,707\n\nOperating lease liabilities, current\n1\n442\n\n440\n\nDeferred revenue and customer deposits, long-term\n3,335\n\n6,709\n\nOperating lease liabilities, non-current\n1\n977\n\n1,617\n\nNon-recourse debt\n2\n (Note 7)\n4,057\n\n4,627\n\n1\n Balances r\nelate to operating leases entered between Korean JV and SK ecoplant.\n2\n\nRepresents the total balance of \ntwo\n term loans entered between Korean JV and SK ecoplant in fiscal year 2023 (see Note 7 — \nOutstanding Loans and Security Agreements\n).\nSK ecoplant Joint Venture and Strategic Partnership\nIn September 2019, we entered into a joint venture agreement with SK ecoplant to establish a light-assembly facility in the Republic of Korea for sales of certain portions of our Energy Server systems for the stationary utility and commercial and industrial market in the Republic of Korea. The joint venture is a VIE of Bloom and we consolidate it in our financial statements as we are the primary beneficiary and therefore have the power to direct activities which are most significant to the joint venture. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we recognized related party revenue of $\n40.2\n million, $\n37.3\n million and $\n36.3\n million, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, and 2023, we had outstanding accounts receivable from related parties of $\n2.5\n million and $\n19.6\n million, and non-recourse debt of $\n4.1\n million and $\n4.6\n million, respectively.\nFor additional information, see Note 17 — \nSK ecoplant Strategic Investment\n.\n\n12. \nRestructuring\nIn September 2023, as a result of a review of current strategic priorities and resource allocation, we approved the restructuring plan (the “Restructuring Plan”) intended to realign our operational focus to support our multi-year growth, scale the business, and improve our cost structure and operating margins. The Restructuring Plan included (i) an optimization of our workforce across multiple functions, (ii) a relocation of our Repair & Overhaul (“R&O”) department from our manufacturing and warehousing facility in Newark, Delaware, to Mexico, and (iii) a closure of a manufacturing, warehousing, research and development (“R&D”) facility in Sunnyvale, California (i.e., facility closure). We began executing the Restructuring Plan in September 2023. The restructuring activities related to an optimization of our workforce and the facility closure were completed in fiscal year 2024. As of December 31, 2024, we have paused our plan to relocate our R&O department from our manufacturing and warehousing facility in Newark, Delaware, to Mexico.\nThe determination of when we accrue for involuntary termination benefits under restructuring plans depends on whether the termination benefits are provided under an ongoing benefit arrangement or under a one-time benefit arrangement. We account for one-time benefit arrangements in accordance with ASC 420, \nExit or Disposal Cost Obligations \n(“ASC 420”) and account for ongoing benefit arrangements in accordance with ASC 712, \nNonretirement Postemployment Benefits\n. For \n 127\ninvoluntary termination benefits that are not provided under the terms of an ongoing benefit arrangement, the liability for the current fair value of expected future costs associated with a management-approved restructuring plan is recognized in the period in which the plan is communicated to the employees and the plan is not expected to change significantly. For ongoing benefit arrangements, inclusive of statutory requirements, employee termination costs are accrued when the existing situation or set of circumstances indicates that an obligation has been incurred, it is probable the benefits will be paid, and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The restructuring charges that have been incurred but not yet paid are recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets, as they are expected to be settled within the next twelve months. Other costs associated with restructuring or exit activities may include contract termination costs, relocation costs and impairments of long-lived assets, which are expensed in accordance with ASC 420 and ASC 360, \nProperty, Plant and Equipment\n.\nAccording to the Restructuring Plan, \n74\n full-time employees and \n48\n contractors were separated from the Company in September 2023. An additional \n71\n full-time employees and \n8\n contractors separated from the Company in October 2023. Both full-time employees and contractors who were impacted by the restructuring were eligible to receive severance benefits.\nOn October 28, 2023, we communicated to an additional \n61\n full-time employees about their separation from the Company on January 2, 2024. These employees were sent on paid leave from the communication date through January 2, 2024, and were eligible for one-time employee termination benefits represented by the base salary they earned through the term of the leave.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, we incurred $\n9.3\n million in restructuring costs recorded as severance expenses of $\n5.3\n million, facility closure costs of $\n2.6\n million, and other restructuring costs of $\n1.4\n million. For the year ended December 31, 2024, the impact from the restructuring on our consolidated statements of operations was not material. We do not expect to incur material restructuring costs in subsequent quarters.\nThe following table presents our current liability as accrued for restructuring charges on our consolidated balance sheets. The table sets forth an analysis of the components of the restructuring charges (releases) and payments made against the accrual for the year ended December 31, 2024 (in thousands):\nFacility Closure\nSeverance\nOther\nTotal\nBalance at December 31, 2022\n$\n—\n\n$\n—\n\n$\n—\n\n$\n—\n\nRestructuring accruals\n2,611\n\n5,306\n\n1,249\n\n9,166\n\nPayments\n(\n34\n)\n(\n4,842\n)\n(\n497\n)\n(\n5,373\n)\nBalance at December 31, 2023\n2,577\n\n464\n\n752\n\n3,793\n\nRestructuring accruals (releases)\n(\n35\n)\n(\n385\n)\n472\n\n52\n\nPayments\n(\n2,542\n)\n(\n79\n)\n(\n883\n)\n(\n3,504\n)\nBalance at December 31, 2024\n$\n—\n\n$\n—\n\n$\n341\n\n$\n341\n\nFacility closure costs (accrual releases) recorded in accordance with ASC 420 related to the closure of a manufacturing, warehousing, R&D facility in Sunnyvale, California, which was consolidated with our manufacturing facility in Fremont, California. As of December 31, 2023, $\n2.6\n million of accrued facility closure costs were included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. There were \nno\n accrued facility closure costs as of December 31, 2024.\nSeverance expense (accrual releases) recorded in accordance with ASC 420 was a result of the separation of \n145\n full-time employees and \n56\n contractors associated with the Restructuring Plan. As of December 31, 2023, $\n0.5\n million of accrued severance-related costs were included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. There were \nno\n accrued severance-related costs as of December 31, 2024.\nOther costs are represented by performance bonuses, stock-based compensation expense, and other one-time employee termination benefits. As of December 31, 2024, and 2023, $\n0.3\n million and $\n0.8\n million of accrued other costs were included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets, respectively.\n 128\nThe following table summarizes restructuring costs included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023 (in thousands):\n\nYear ended December 31, 2023\nCost of product revenue\n$\n2,976\n\nCost of installation revenue\n71\n\nCost of service revenue\n521\n\nOperating expenses:\nResearch and development\n1,609\n\nSales and marketing\n1,679\n\nGeneral and administrative\n2,467\n\nTotal\n$\n9,323\n\nRestructuring costs\n included in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2024, were \nimmaterial\n.\n13. \nCommitments and Contingencies\nCommitments\nPurchase Commitments with Suppliers and Contract Manufacturers — \nIn order to reduce manufacturing lead-times for an adequate supply of inventories, we have agreements with our component suppliers and contract manufacturers to allow long lead-time component inventory procurement based on a rolling production forecast. We are contractually obligated to purchase long lead-time component inventory procured by certain manufacturers in accordance with our forecasts. We can generally give notice of order cancellation at least 90 days prior to the delivery date. However, we occasionally issue purchase orders to our component suppliers and third-party manufacturers that may not be cancellable. As of December 31, 2024, and 2023, we had \nno\n material open purchase orders with our component suppliers and third-party manufacturers that are expected to be realized within more than a 12-month period and are not cancellable.\nPerformance Guarantees — \nWe guarantee the performance of the Energy Server systems at certain levels of output and efficiency to our customers over the contractual term. We monitor the need for any accruals arising from such guaranties, which are calculated as the difference between committed and actual power output or between natural gas consumption at warranted efficiency levels and actual consumption, multiplied by the contractual rates with the customer. Amounts payable under these guaranties are accrued in periods when the guaranties are not met and are recorded as service revenue in the consolidated statements of operations. We paid $\n21.2\n million, $\n25.9\n million and $\n12.1\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, for such performance guarantees.\nLetters of Credit\n — In 2019, pursuant to the PPA II repowering of the Energy Server systems, we agreed to indemnify our financing partner for losses that may be incurred in the event of certain regulatory, legal or legislative developments and established a cash-collateralized letter of credit facility for this purpose. As of December 31, 2024, and 2023, the balance of this cash-collateralized letter of credit was $\n9.5\n million and $\n40.4\n million, respectively.\nIn December 2024, we issued a $\n100.0\n million letter of credit in favor of one of our major customers to guarantee the performance in accordance with the limited indemnity and cooperation agreement dated November 14, 2024, related to the supply of \n100\n MW of Energy Server systems. This letter of credit was released in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025.\nIn addition, we have other outstanding letters of credit issued to our customers and other counterparties in the U.S. and international locations under different performance and financial obligations. These letters of credit are collateralized through cash deposited in the controlled bank accounts with the issuing banks and are classified as restricted cash in our consolidated balance sheets. In September 2023, we canceled certain existing cash-collateralized letters of credit with an approximate value of $\n60.4\n million issued to our customers in the Republic of Korea under long-term service agreements and replaced them with surety bonds on a non-collateralized basis. As of December 31, 2024, and 2023, the balances of the cash-collateralized letters of \ncredit issued to our customers and other counterparties in the U.S. and international locations other than PPA II were $\n131.2\n million and $\n32.6\n million, respectively.\nPledged Funds\n — In 2019, pursuant to the PPA IIIb repowering of the Energy Server systems, we established a restricted cash fund of $\n20.0\n million, which had been pledged for a \nseven-year\n period to secure our operations and maintenance obligations with respect to the totality of our obligations to the financier. These funds will be released to us by the end of 2026 as long as the Energy Server systems continue to perform in compliance with our warranty obligations. As of December 31, 2024, and 2023, the balance of the restricted cash fund was $\n7.4\n million and $\n7.6\n million, respectively.\nContingencies\nIndemnification Agreements — \nWe enter into standard indemnification agreements with our customers and certain other business partners in the ordinary course of business. Our exposure under these agreements is unknown because it involves future claims that may be made against us but have not yet been made. To date, we have not paid any claims or been required to defend any action related to our indemnification obligations. However, we may record charges in the future as a result of these indemnification obligations.\nInvestment Tax Credits\n — Until the end of fiscal year 2024, our Energy Server systems running on a non-zero carbon fuel were eligible for federal ITCs that accrued to qualified property under Internal Revenue Code Section 48 when placed into service. However, the ITC program has operational criteria that extends for five years. If the energy property is disposed of or otherwise ceases to be qualified investment credit property before the close of the five-year recapture period is fulfilled, it could result in a partial reduction of the incentives.\nLegal Matters — \nWe are involved in various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. We review all legal matters at least quarterly and assess whether an accrual for loss contingencies needs to be recorded. We record an accrual for loss contingencies when management believes that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Legal matters are subject to uncertainties and are inherently unpredictable, so the actual liability in any such matter may be materially different from our estimates. If an unfavorable resolution were to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows for the period in which the resolution occurs or in future periods.\nIn March 2019, the Lincolnshire Police Pension Fund filed a class action complaint in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Santa Clara, against us, certain members of our senior management, certain of our directors and the underwriters in our July 25, 2018 IPO alleging violations under Sections 11 and 15 of the Securities Act for alleged misleading statements or omissions in our Registration Statement on Form S-1 filed with the SEC in connection with the IPO. \nTwo\n related class action cases were subsequently filed in the Santa Clara County Superior Court against the same defendants containing the same allegations.\nOn January 6, 2023, Bloom and the plaintiffs’ entered into an agreement in principle to settle the claims against Bloom, its executives and directors, and the IPO underwriters for a payment of $\n3.0\n million, which was funded entirely by our insurers. On May 9, 2024, in light of the stipulated settlement, the court issued an order dismissing the lawsuit with prejudice.\nIn February 2022, Plansee SE/Global Tungsten & Powders Corp. (“Plansee/GTP”), a former supplier, filed a request for expedited arbitration with the World Intellectual Property Organization Arbitration and Mediation Center in Geneva Switzerland (“WIPO”), for various claims allegedly in relation to an Intellectual Property and Confidential Disclosure Agreement between Plansee/GTP and Bloom Energy Corporation. Plansee/GTP’s statement of claims includes allegations of infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 8,802,328, 8,753,785 and 9,434,003. On April 3, 2022, we filed a complaint against Plansee/GTP in the Eastern District of Texas to address the dispute between Plansee/GTP and Bloom Energy Corporation in a proper forum before a U.S. Federal District Court. Our complaint seeks the correction of inventorship of U.S. Patent Nos. 8,802,328, 8,753,785 and 9,434,003 (the “Patents-in-Suit”); declaratory judgment of invalidity, unenforceability, and non-infringement of the Patents-in-Suit; and declaratory judgment of no misappropriation. Further, our complaint seeks to recover damages we have suffered in relation to Plansee/GTP’s business dealings that, as alleged, constitute acts of unfair competition, tortious interference contract, breach of contract, violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act and violations of the Clayton Antitrust Act. On June 9, 2022, Plansee/GTP filed a motion to dismiss the complaint filed in the Eastern District of Texas and compel arbitration (or alternatively to stay). We filed our opposition on June 30, 2022, Plansee/GTP filed its reply on July 14, 2022, and we filed our sur-reply on July 22, 2022. On February 9, 2023, Magistrate Judge Payne issued a report and recommendation to stay the district court action pending an arbitrability determination by the arbitrator for each claim.\nOn February 23, 2023, we filed an amended complaint adding additional causes of action and filed objections to the Magistrate’s report and recommendation. On April 26, 2023, Judge Gilstrap overruled our objections to the Magistrate’s report and recommendation and stayed the district court action pending arbitrability determinations by the arbitrator in the WIPO proceeding. The arbitration had been held in abeyance awaiting the decision of the Eastern District of Texas. A hearing by the arbitrator in WIPO on arbitrability took place on June 27, 2023. On October 2, 2023, the arbitrator in the WIPO proceeding issued a ruling concluding that all the parties’ claims were arbitrable. On November 18, 2023, the arbitrator bifurcated the arbitration into a first phase that will focus on Bloom’s claims directed to improper inventorship of the Patents-in-Suit and Bloom’s defective product claims. Briefing on the first phase took place throughout 2024 with a potential evidentiary hearing to be scheduled in 2025. We are unable to predict the ultimate outcome of the arbitration at this time.\n14. \nSegment Information \nASC 280, \nSegment Reporting\n, (“ASC 280”) establishes standards for companies to report in their financial statement information about operating segments, products, services, geographic areas, and major customers. Based on the criteria established by ASC 280, our chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) has been identified as the Chief Executive Officer. The CODM reviews consolidated results when making decisions about allocating resources and assessing the performance of the Company as a whole and hence, we have only \none\n reportable segment. We do not distinguish between markets or segments for the purpose of internal reporting.\nSignificant segment expenses that are provided to CODM on a regular basis and are included within reported measure of segment profit or loss are:\n•\ncost of product revenue, \n•\ncost of installation revenue,\n•\ncost of service revenue, \n•\ncost of electricity revenue,\n•\nresearch and development expenses, \n•\nsales and marketing expenses, and;\n•\ngeneral and administrative expenses.\nOther segment items are represented by interest income, interest expense, other (expenses) income, net, loss (gain) on extinguishment of debt, (loss) gain on revaluation of embedded derivatives, and income tax provision. \nPlease refer to the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, for significant segment expenses and other segment items.\nThe Company’s primary measure of segment profitability is non-GAAP gross profit margin. Non-GAAP gross profit margin is defined by the Company as non-GAAP gross profit divided by total revenue. Non-GAAP gross profit is the difference between total revenue and non-GAAP total cost of revenue, which represents the total cost of revenue adjusted by items that do not contribute directly to management’s evaluation of its operating results. These items include stock-based compensation, impairment charges, restructuring accruals (releases), and other adjustments. This presentation is consistent with how the Company’s CODM evaluates the results of operations and makes strategic decisions about the business. For these reasons, the Company believes that non-GAAP gross profit margin represents the most relevant measure of segment profit and loss.\nFor information on the Company’s geographic risk, please refer to Note 1 — \nNature of Business, Liquidity and Basis of Presentation, Concentration of Risk\n.\n 129\n15. \nIncome Taxes\nThe components of loss before the provision for income taxes are as follows (in thousands):\n\nYears Ended\nDecember 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nUnited States\n$\n(\n29,969\n)\n$\n(\n310,243\n)\n$\n(\n320,107\n)\nForeign\n3,612\n\n4,200\n\n6,118\n\n    Total\n$\n(\n26,357\n)\n$\n(\n306,043\n)\n$\n(\n313,989\n)\n\nThe provision for income taxes consists of the following (in thousands): \nYears Ended\nDecember 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n\nCurrent:\nState\n$\n(\n13\n)\n$\n246\n\n$\n374\n\nForeign\n1,182\n\n1,640\n\n1,158\n\nTotal current\n1,169\n\n1,886\n\n1,532\n\nDeferred:\nForeign\n(\n323\n)\n8\n\n(\n435\n)\nTotal deferred\n(\n323\n)\n8\n\n(\n435\n)\nTotal provision for income taxes\n$\n846\n\n$\n1,894\n\n$\n1,097\n\nA reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate to our effective tax rate is as follows (in thousands): \nYears Ended\nDecember 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nTax at federal statutory rate\n$\n(\n5,534\n)\n$\n(\n64,270\n)\n$\n(\n65,922\n)\nState taxes, net of federal effect\n(\n13\n)\n246\n\n374\n\nImpact of noncontrolling interest\n(\n425\n)\n1,222\n\n2,872\n\nNon-U.S. tax effect\n392\n\n1,067\n\n(\n387\n)\nNondeductible expenses and losses\n1,349\n\n5,239\n\n2,258\n\nStock-based compensation\n9,479\n\n3,222\n\n7,019\n\nLoss on debt extinguishment\n5,458\n\n—\n\n—\n\nU.S. tax on foreign earnings (GILTI)\n428\n\n86\n\n2,525\n\n(Gain) loss on SK Equity Transaction\n—\n\n11,811\n\n(\n3,932\n)\nChange in valuation allowance\n(\n10,288\n)\n43,271\n\n56,290\n\nProvision for income taxes\n$\n846\n\n$\n1,894\n\n$\n1,097\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recognized a provision for income taxes of $\n0.8\n million on a pre-tax loss of $\n26.4\n million, for an effective tax rate of (\n3.2\n)%. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we recognized a provision for income taxes of $\n1.9\n million on a pre-tax loss of $\n306.0\n million, for an effective tax rate of (\n0.6\n)%. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we recognized a provision for income taxes of $\n1.1\n million on a pre-tax loss of $\n314.0\n million, for an \n 130\neffective tax rate of (\n0.3\n)%. The effective tax rate for 2024, 2023 and 2022, is lower than the statutory federal tax rate primarily due to a full valuation allowance against U.S. deferred tax assets.\nSignificant components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities consist of the following (in thousands): \nDecember 31,\n2024\n2023\n\nTax credits and net operating loss carryforwards\n$\n604,681\n\n$\n574,679\n\nLease liabilities\n103,313\n\n151,470\n\nDepreciation and amortization\n14,131\n\n59,790\n\nDeferred revenue\n9,603\n\n13,580\n\nAccruals and reserves\n29,509\n\n36,096\n\nResearch and development expenditures capitalization\n71,229\n\n53,991\n\nStock-based compensation\n18,808\n\n19,698\n\nDisallowed Interest expenses\n27,873\n\n29,581\n\nOther items — deferred tax assets\n2,544\n\n1,695\n\nGross deferred tax assets\n881,691\n\n940,580\n\nValuation allowance\n(\n816,257\n)\n(\n831,597\n)\nNet deferred tax assets\n65,434\n\n108,983\n\nManaged services — deferred costs\n—\n\n(\n16,826\n)\nRight-of-use assets and leased assets\n(\n60,043\n)\n(\n88,391\n)\nCapitalized Commission\n(\n3,503\n)\n(\n2,381\n)\nGross deferred tax liabilities\n(\n63,546\n)\n(\n107,598\n)\nNet deferred tax asset\n$\n1,888\n\n$\n1,385\n\nIncome taxes are recorded using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income (or loss) in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nA valuation allowance is provided for the amount of deferred tax assets that, based on available evidence, is not more-likely-than-not to be realized. Management believes that, based on available evidence, both positive and negative, it is not more likely than not that the net U.S. deferred tax assets will be utilized. As a result, a full valuation allowance has been recorded.\nThe valuation allowance for deferred tax assets was $\n816.3\n million and $\n831.6\n million as of December 31, 2024, and 2023, respectively. The net change in the total valuation allowance for the years ended December 31, 2024, and 2023, was a decrease of $\n15.3\n million and an increase of $\n73.4\n million, respectively.\nAt December 31, 2024, we had federal and California net operating loss carryforwards of $\n2.2\n billion and $\n1.5\n billion, respectively, to reduce future taxable income. \nThe expiration of federal and California net operating loss carryforwards is summarized as follows (in billions):\n\nFederal\nCalifornia\nExpire in 2025 - 2029\n$\n0.2\n\n$\n0.2\n\nExpire in 2030 - 2034\n0.9\n\n0.6\n\nExpire beginning in 2035\n0.5\n\n0.7\n\nCarryforward indefinitely\n0.6\n\n—\n\nTotal\n$\n2.2\n\n$\n1.5\n\n 131\nAt December 31, 2024, we also had other state net operating loss carryforwards of $\n403.9\n million, that begin to expire in fiscal year 2025, and Japanese net operating loss carryforwards of $\n7.9\n million, that will begin to expire in fiscal 2025. Korea had operating loss of $\n0.5\n million, that will begin to expire in fiscal year 2039. In addition, at December 31, 2024, we had approximately $\n43.4\n million of federal research credit, $\n6.6\n million of federal investment tax credit, and $\n20.6\n million of state research credit carryforwards. \nThe expiration of the federal and California credit carryforwards is summarized as follows (in millions):\nFederal\nCalifornia\nExpire in 2025 - 2029\n$\n5.3\n\n$\n—\n\nExpire in 2030 - 2034\n8.8\n\n—\n\nExpire beginning in 2035\n36.0\n\n—\n\nCarryforward indefinitely\n—\n\n20.6\n\nTotal\n$\n50.1\n\n$\n20.6\n\nWe have not reflected deferred tax assets for the federal and state research credit carryforwards as the entire amount of the carryforwards represents unrecognized tax benefits.\nInternal Revenue Code Section 382 (“Section 382”) limits the use of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in certain situations in which changes occur in our capital stock ownership. Any annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits before utilization. If we should have an ownership change, as defined by the tax law, utilization of the net operating loss and credit carryforwards could be significantly reduced. Based on our analysis, Section 382 limitations will not have a material impact on our net operating loss and credit carryforwards related to any ownership changes.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, the amount of uncertain tax positions an increase by $\n5.8\n million. We have not recorded any uncertain tax liabilities associated with our tax positions.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits were as follows (in thousands):\nYears Ended\nDecember 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nUnrecognized tax benefits beginning balance\n$\n58,157\n\n$\n48,389\n\n$\n42,010\n\nGross decrease for tax positions of prior year\n(\n145\n)\n(\n152\n)\n(\n55\n)\nGross increase for tax positions of prior year\n—\n\n1,307\n\n—\n\nGross increase for tax positions of current year\n5,939\n\n8,613\n\n6,434\n\nUnrecognized tax benefits end balance\n$\n63,951\n\n$\n58,157\n\n$\n48,389\n\nIf fully recognized in the future, there would be no impact to the effective tax rate, and $\n59.6\n million would result in adjustments to the valuation allowance. We do not have any tax positions that are expected to significantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months.\nInterest and penalties, to the extent there are any, would be included in income tax expense. There were \nno\n material interest or penalties accrued during or for the years ended December 31, 2024, and 2023.\nThe Company is subject to taxation in the U.S. and various state and foreign jurisdictions. All of the Company’s tax years will remain open for examination by federal and state authorities for three and four years, respectively, from the date of utilization of any net operating losses and tax credits. There are currently no pending income tax examinations in the United States. The Company currently has an Indian income tax examination in progress. Although the timing of the resolution of an income tax examination is highly uncertain, we believe the final determination will not have a material impact to our financial position.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“Tax Act”) includes a provision referred to as Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (“GILTI”) which generally imposes a tax on foreign income in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets. Guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board in January 2018 allows companies to make an accounting policy election to either \n 132\n(i) account for GILTI as a component of tax expense in the period in which the tax is incurred (“period cost method”), or (ii) account for GILTI in the measurement of deferred taxes (“deferred method”). We elected to account for the tax effects of this provision using the period cost method.\nOn August 16, 2022, the U.S. government enacted the IRA. The IRA establishes a new corporate alternative minimum tax based on financial statement income adjusted for certain items. The new minimum tax is effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2022. The enactment of the IRA did not have a material impact on our tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2024, and 2023.\nThe accumulated undistributed foreign earnings of the Company as of December 31, 2024, have been subject to either the deemed one-time mandatory repatriation under the Tax Act or the current year income inclusion under GILTI regime for U.S. tax purposes. If we were to make actual distributions of some or all of these earnings, including earnings accumulated after December 31, 2017, we would generally incur no additional U.S. income tax but could incur U.S. state income tax and foreign withholding taxes. We have not accrued for these potential U.S. state income tax and foreign withholding taxes because we intend to indefinitely reinvest our foreign earnings in our international operations. However, any additional income tax associated with the distribution of these earnings would be immaterial.\n16. \nNet Loss per Share Available to Common Stockholders\nNet loss per share (basic) available to common stockholders is calculated by dividing net loss available to common stockholders by the weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Net loss per share is the same for each class of common stock as they are entitled to the same liquidation and dividend rights. As a result, net loss per share (basic) and net loss per share (diluted) available to common stockholders are the same for both Class A and Class B common stock and are combined for presentation. On July 27, 2023, each share of our Class B common stock automatically converted into \none\n share of our Class A common stock.\nNet loss per share (diluted) is computed by using (i) the if-converted method when calculating the potentially dilutive effect, if any, of our convertible notes, and our redeemable convertible preferred stock, and (ii) the treasury stock method when calculating the potentially dilutive effect, if any, of our outstanding stock options and awards, and shares issued in conjunction with the Company’s ESPP. Net loss per share (diluted) available to common stockholders is then calculated by dividing the resulting adjusted net loss available to common stockholders by the combined weighted-average number of fully diluted common shares outstanding. There were no adjustments to net loss available to common stockholders (diluted). Equally, there were no adjustments to the weighted average number of outstanding shares of common stock (basic) in arriving at the weighted average number of outstanding shares (diluted), as such adjustments would have been antidilutive.\nThe following table sets forth the computation of our net loss per share available to common stockholders, basic and diluted (in thousands, except per share amounts):\nYears Ended\nDecember 31,\n\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNumerator:\nNet loss available to common stockholders\n$\n(\n29,227\n)\n$\n(\n302,116\n)\n$\n(\n301,708\n)\nDenominator:\nWeighted average shares of common stock, basic and diluted\n227,365\n\n212,681\n\n185,907\n\nNet loss per share available to common stockholders, basic and diluted\n$\n(\n0.13\n)\n$\n(\n1.42\n)\n$\n(\n1.62\n)\n 133\nThe following common stock equivalents (in thousands) were excluded from the computation of our net loss per share available to common stockholders, diluted, for the years presented as their inclusion would have been antidilutive (in thousands):\n\nYears Ended\nDecember 31,\n\n2024\n2023\n2022\n\nConvertible notes\n55,020\n\n35,327\n\n14,187\n\nRedeemable convertible preferred stock\n—\n\n9,795\n\n8,521\n\nStock options and awards\n6,325\n\n4,011\n\n5,683\n\n61,345\n\n49,133\n\n28,391\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, pursuant to the notice received from SK ecoplant of its intent to exercise its option to purchase additional shares of our Class A common stock, there were an additional \n13,491,701\n common stock equivalents that were excluded from the table above.\n17. \nSK ecoplant Strategic Investment\nIn October 2021, we expanded our existing relationship with SK ecoplant. As part of this arrangement, we amended the previous Preferred Distribution Agreement (the “Restated PDA”) and the Joint Venture Agreement (the “JVA”) with SK ecoplant. The Restated PDA establishes SK ecoplant’s purchase commitments for our Energy Server systems for the \nthree-year\n period on a take-or-pay basis as well as the basis for determining the prices at which the Energy Server systems and related components will be sold. The restated JVA increases the scope of assembly done by the joint venture facility in the Republic of Korea, which was established in 2019, for the procurement of local parts for our Energy Server systems and the assembly of certain portions of the Energy Server systems for the South Korean market. The joint venture is a VIE of Bloom and we consolidate it in our financial statements as we are the primary beneficiary and therefore have the power to direct activities which are most significant to the joint venture.\nIn October 2021, we also entered into a new Commercial Cooperation Agreement (the “CCA”) regarding initiatives pertaining to the hydrogen market and general market expansion for our products.\nIn September 23, 2023, we entered into the Amended and Restated Joint Venture Agreement (the “JVA”) and the Share Purchase Agreement (together, the “Amended JV Agreements”) with SK ecoplant which allowed SK ecoplant to increase its share of the voting rights in the Korean JV to \n60\n% and increased the scope of assembly done by the joint venture facility in the Republic of Korea to full assembly. In January 2024, in accordance with the Amended JV Agreements, SK ecoplant made a capital contribution to Korean JV of $\n4.0\n million.\nNeither the Amended JV Agreements, nor the fact that SK ecoplant is considered to be our related party after the conversion of Series B RCPS into shares of our Class A common stock (for additional information, please see Note 11 — \nRelated Party Transactions\n) changed our status as the primary beneficiary of the Korean JV. Therefore, we continue to consolidate this VIE in our financial statements as of December 31, 2024.\n 134\nThe following are the aggregate carrying values of the Korean JV’s assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets, after eliminations of intercompany transactions and balances, as of December 31, 2024, and 2023 (in thousands):\nDecember 31,\n2024\n2023\nAssets\nCurrent assets:\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n15,767\n\n$\n3,003\n\nAccounts receivable\n2,515\n\n19,567\n\nInventories\n15,020\n\n8,156\n\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets\n3,361\n\n644\n\nTotal current assets\n36,663\n\n31,370\n\nProperty and equipment, net\n1,796\n\n2,519\n\nOperating lease right-of-use assets\n1,663\n\n2,138\n\nOther long-term assets\n40\n\n46\n\nTotal assets\n$\n40,162\n\n$\n36,073\n\nLiabilities\nCurrent liabilities:\nAccounts payable\n$\n7,693\n\n$\n3,480\n\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities\n2,154\n\n2,347\n\nOperating lease liabilities\n442\n\n440\n\nTotal current liabilities\n10,289\n\n6,267\n\nOperating lease liabilities\n977\n\n1,617\n\nNon-recourse debt\n4,057\n\n4,627\n\nTotal liabilities\n$\n15,323\n\n$\n12,511\n\nIn September 2023, and December 2023, we entered into the First and the Second Amendments to the Restated PDA, respectively (the “First Amended Restated PDA” and the “Second Amended Restated PDA”, respectively). The First Amended Restated PDA amends the delivery terms. The Second Amended Restated PDA extends the initial term of the Restated PDA to December 31, 2027, and increases SK ecoplant’s purchase commitments for Bloom Energy products.\nThe Second Amended Restated PDA adds a new minimum purchase commitment of \n250\n megawatts and extends the timing of delivery of the remaining take-or- pay commitment under the original agreement. For the \nfour-year\n period from January 1, 2024, to December 31, 2027, the total purchase commitment under the Second Amended Restated PDA is \n500\n megawatts, including a re-commitment of \n250\n megawatts from the Restated PDA and an additional \n250\n megawatts commitment.\nUnder the Second Amended Restated PDA SK ecoplant can fulfill its volume commitments with both our Energy Server systems and the Electrolyzer and this enables SK ecoplant to pursue opportunities globally outside of the Republic of Korea. The purchase commitments are expressed on a quarterly and annual basis. Should SK ecoplant fail to meet these purchase commitments, this would constitute\n an event of default and we would be entitled to damages equivalent to the lost profit.\nThe Initial Investment\nIn October 2021, we entered into the SPA pursuant to which we agreed to sell and issue to SK ecoplant \n10,000,000\n shares of Series A RCPS at a purchase price of $\n25.50\n per share for an aggregate purchase price of $\n255.0\n million. On December 29, 2021, the closing of the sale of the Series A RCPS was completed, and we issued \n10,000,000\n shares of the Series A RCPS (the “Initial Investment”).\nIn addition to the Initial Investment, the SPA provided SK ecoplant with an option to acquire a variable number of shares of Class A common stock (the “Option”). According to the SPA, SK ecoplant was entitled to exercise the Option through August 31, 2023, and the transaction must have been completed by November 30, 2023.\nThe sale of Series A RCPS was recorded at its fair value of $\n218.0\n million on the date of issuance. Accordingly, we \n 135\nallocated the excess of the cash proceeds received of $\n255.0\n million plus the change in fair value of the Series A RCPS between October 23, 2021, and December 29, 2021, of $\n9.7\n million, over the fair value of the Series A RCPS on December 29, 2021, and the fair value of the Option on October 23, 2021, to the PDA. This excess amounted to $\n37.0\n million and was recorded in deferred revenue and customer deposits. Accordingly, during the year ended December 31, 2022, we recognized product revenue of $\n9.6\n million in connection with this arrangement. \nNo\n product revenue was recognized during the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 in connection with this arrangement. As of March 31, 2023, the unrecognized amount of deferred revenue and customer deposits of $\n24.6\n million was reduced to \nzero\n as a result of the Second Tranche Closing (see details below in section “The Second Tranche Closing”).\nRestated PDA, JVA, CCA and the SPA entered into with SK ecoplant concurrently were evaluated as a combined contract in accordance with ASC 606\n\nand, to the extent applicable for separated components, under the guidance of Topic 815 \nDerivatives and Hedging\n and applicable subsections and ASC 480, \nDistinguishing Liabilities from Equity.\nWe concluded that the Option was a freestanding financial instrument that should have been separately recorded at fair value on the date the SPA was executed. We determined the fair value of the Option on that date to be $\n9.6\n million.\nOn August 10, 2022, pursuant to the SPA, SK ecoplant notified us of its intent to exercise its option to purchase additional shares of our Class A common stock, pursuant to a Second Tranche Exercise Notice (as defined in the SPA) electing to purchase \n13,491,701\n shares at a purchase price of $\n23.05\n per share. The Option was fairly valued as of the notice date at $\n4.2\n million and gain on revaluation of $\n9.0\n million was recorded under other income (expense), net in our consolidated statements of operations. Upon the receipt of the notice from SK ecoplant the Option met the criteria of equity award and was classified as a forward contract as part of additional paid-in capital.\nOn November 8, 2022, each share of the Series A RCPS was converted into \n10,000,000\n shares of Class A common stock.\nOn December 6, 2022, SK and Bloom mutually agreed to delay the Second Tranche Closing until March 31, 2023. The mutual agreement to modify the closing date did not change the accounting or valuation of the equity-classified forward recorded.\nThe Second Tranche Closing\nOn March 20, 2023, SK ecoplant entered into the Amended SPA with us, pursuant to which on March 23, 2023, we issued and sold to SK ecoplant \n13,491,701\n shares of non-voting Series B RCPS, par value $\n0.0001\n per share, at a purchase price of $\n23.05\n per share for cash proceeds of $\n311.0\n million, excluding issuance cost of $\n0.5\n million.\nThe Amended SPA triggered the modification of the equity-classified forward contract on Class A common stock, which resulted in the derecognition of the pre-modified fair value of the forward contract given to SK ecoplant of $\n76.2\n million. We valued the forward contract as the difference between our Class A common stock trading price adjusted by a discount for lack of marketability (“DLOM”) as of the date of Amended SPA (the “Valuation Date”) and the present value of the strike price, with further reduction associated with the expected outcome of the Second Tranche Closing. The derecognition of the pre-modified fair value was recorded in additional paid-in capital in our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2024, and 2023.\nThe Series B RCPS was accounted for as a stock award with liability and equity components. The liability component of the Series B RCPS was recognized at the redemption value of $\n311.0\n million, less issuance costs of $\n0.5\n million, and was recorded in current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets as of March 31, 2023. The equity component of the Series B RCPS (the “Conversion Option”) was valued as a European-type call option under the guidance of ASC 718 by applying the Black-Scholes valuation model using inputs of the strike price, maturity, risk-free rate, and volatility. In addition, DLOM was applied to the Class A common stock price. The Conversion Option was recognized at its fair value of $\n16.1\n million on March 20, 2023, and recorded in additional paid-in capital in our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2024, and 2023.\nOn March 20, 2023, in connection with the Amended SPA we also entered into the Loan Agreement, pursuant to which we had the option to draw on a loan from SK ecoplant with a maximum principal amount of $\n311.0\n million, a maturity of \nfive years\n and an interest rate of \n4.6\n%, should SK ecoplant have sent a redemption notice to us under the Amended SPA (i.e., loan commitment asset). We concluded that the loan commitment was a freestanding financial instrument as of the Valuation Date, as such its fair value was based on the difference between the present value of cash flows associated with a loan with a market-participant based interest rate (i.e., the rate for which the value of the hypothetical loan agreement equals the face value of the \n 136\nLoan Agreement) and the cash flows associated with the loan committed to by SK ecoplant, and applied a redemption probability to the difference. The Series B RCPS redemption probability was obtained from a lattice model used to value the Series B preferred stock. As of September 30, 2023, the loan commitment asset from SK ecoplant was derecognized as a result of automatic conversion of all shares of the Series B RCPS into shares of our Class A common stock.\nThe Amended SPA and the Loan Agreement provided us with cash proceeds of $\n311.0\n million and a loan commitment asset of $\n52.8\n million from SK ecoplant for total consideration of $\n363.8\n million. In return, SK ecoplant received consideration of $\n403.3\n million, consisting of the release from the obligation to close on the original transaction fair valued at $\n76.2\n million, the obligation from us to issue the Series B RCPS at redemption value of $\n311.0\n million, and the option to convert the Series B RCPS to Class A common stock, which had an estimated fair value of $\n16.1\n million. The excess consideration provided by us amounted to $\n39.5\n million, which resulted in a reduction of our deferred revenue and customer deposits by $\n24.6\n million related to the Initial Investment, as of March 31, 2023. The net excess consideration of $\n14.9\n million was recognized as $\n8.2\n million in prepaid expenses and other current assets and $\n6.7\n million was classified as other long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets as of March 31, 2023.
