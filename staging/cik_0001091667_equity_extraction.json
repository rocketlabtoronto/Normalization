(together with its controlled subsidiaries, “Charter,” or the “Company”) is a leading broadband connectivity company and cable operator.  Over an advanced communications network, the Company offers a full range of state-of-the-art residential and business services including Spectrum Internet\n®\n, TV, Mobile and Voice.  For small and medium-sized companies, Spectrum Business\n®\n delivers the same suite of broadband products and services coupled with special features and applications to enhance productivity, while for larger businesses and government entities, Spectrum Enterprise\n®\n provides highly customized, fiber-based solutions. Spectrum Reach\n®\n delivers tailored advertising and production for the modern media landscape. The Company also distributes award-winning news coverage and sports programming to its customers through Spectrum Networks.   \nCharter is a holding company whose principal asset is a controlling equity interest in Charter Communications Holdings, LLC (“Charter Holdings”), an indirect owner of Charter Communications Operating, LLC (“Charter Operating”) under which substantially all of the operations reside. \nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Areas involving significant judgments and estimates include capitalization of labor and overhead costs, pension benefits and income taxes.  Actual results could differ from those estimates. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform with the 2024 presentation.\nComprehensive income equaled net income attributable to Charter shareholders for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\n2.    \nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\nInformation on other accounting policies and methods that the Company uses in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements are included, where applicable, in their respective footnotes.  Below is a discussion of accounting policies and methods used in the Company's consolidated financial statements that are not presented within other footnotes.\nConsolidation \nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Charter and all entities in which Charter has a controlling interest, including variable interest entities (“VIEs”) where Charter is the primary beneficiary.  The Company consolidates based upon evaluation of the Company’s power, through voting rights or similar rights, to direct the activities of another entity that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance; its obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity; and its right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity.  Charter controls and consolidates Charter Holdings.  The noncontrolling interest on the Company’s balance sheet primarily represents Advance/Newhouse Partnership's (“A/N”) minority equity interests in Charter Holdings.  See Note 11.  All significant intercompany accounts and transactions among consolidated entities have been eliminated in consolidation.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\n\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.  These investments are carried at cost, which approximates market value.\n\nF-8\nCHARTER COMMUNICATIONS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDecember 31, 2024, 2023 AND 2022\n(dollars in millions, except share or per share data or where indicated)\nValuation of Long-Lived Assets\n\nThe Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets (e.g., property, plant and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets) to be held and used when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.  Such events or changes in circumstances could include such factors as impairment of the Company’s indefinite life assets, changes in technological advances, fluctuations in the fair value of such assets, adverse changes in relationships with local franchise authorities, adverse changes in market conditions or a deterioration of current or expected future operating results.  If a review indicates that the carrying value of such asset is not recoverable from estimated undiscounted cash flows, the carrying value of such asset is reduced to its estimated fair value.  While the Company believes that its estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, different assumptions regarding such cash flows could materially affect its evaluations of asset recoverability.  \nNo\n impairments of long-lived assets held for use were recorded in 2024, 2023 and 2022.\nFair Value Measurements\nAccounting guidance\n\nestablishes a three-level hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurements, based on the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date, as follows:\n•\nLevel 1 – inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\n•\nLevel 2 – inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.\n•\nLevel 3 – inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.\nThe Company estimates the fair value of its financial instruments using available market information or other appropriate valuation methodologies.  Considerable judgment, however, is required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value.  Accordingly, the estimates presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company would realize in a current market exchange. \nThe Company’s nonfinancial assets such as equity method investments, franchises, property, plant, and equipment, and other intangible assets are not measured at fair value on a recurring basis; however, they are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances, such as when there is evidence that an impairment may exist.  When such impairments are recorded, fair values are generally classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. \nThe carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, payables and other current assets and liabilities approximate fair value because of the short maturity of those instruments.\nGovernment Assistance\nThe Company's government assistance primarily consists of federal subsidies from the Rural Development Opportunity Fund (“RDOF”) and state broadband grants primarily funded by the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (“ARPA”).  The Company was awarded approximately $\n1.1\n billion in federal subsidies in phase I of the RDOF auction to be received monthly over ten years to deploy and operate broadband services to unserved communities to more than one million estimated passings.  For accounting purposes, RDOF subsidies are recorded as other revenues since the primary conditions for the receipt of the subsidies are the build out and operation of the broadband network over the ten years.  During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, \nother revenues\n included approximately $\n108\n million, $\n116\n million and $\n107\n million of RDOF subsidy revenue, respectively.  \nThe Company has also been awarded broadband grants to construct broadband infrastructure to unserved and underserved communities by various state and local governments.  As of December 31, 2024, the Company has been publicly awarded approximately $\n1.3\n billion in state grants, of which approximately $\n1.1\n billion of these state grants have been formalized into executed agreements.  State grants are either a fixed subsidy or variable with a subsidy cap conditioned upon construction.  Cash is paid either upon project completion, milestone completion, or in some instances a portion of grant is paid in advance.  Prefunded grants are subject to recapture if buildouts are not completed.  For accounting purposes state broadband grants are \nF-9\nCHARTER COMMUNICATIONS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDecember 31, 2024, 2023 AND 2022\n(dollars in millions, except share or per share data or where indicated)\ngenerally recorded as a reduction to property, plant and equipment using a percentage of completion, since the primary conditions for these grants are to build out the broadband network.  During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the amount of state broadband grants recorded in the consolidated financial statements was not material.\n\nAdvertising Costs\n\nAdvertising costs associated with marketing the Company’s products and services are generally expensed as costs are incurred.\n3.    \nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nAdditions to property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost, including all material, labor and certain indirect costs associated with the construction of cable transmission and distribution facilities.  While the Company’s capitalization is based on specific activities, once capitalized, costs are tracked on a composite basis by fixed asset category at the cable system level and not on a specific asset basis.  For assets that are sold or retired, the estimated historical cost and related accumulated depreciation is removed.  Costs associated with the placement of the customer drop to the dwelling and the placement of outlets within a dwelling along with the costs associated with the deployment of new customer premise equipment necessary to provide video, Internet or voice services are capitalized.  Costs capitalized include materials, direct labor and overhead costs.  The Company capitalizes direct labor and overhead using standards developed from actual costs and applicable operational data. The Company calculates standards annually (or more frequently if circumstances dictate) for items such as the labor rates, overhead rates, and the actual amount of time required to perform a capitalizable activity.  Overhead costs are associated with the activities of the Company’s personnel and consist of compensation and other indirect costs associated with support functions.  Indirect costs primarily include employee benefits and payroll taxes, and vehicle and occupancy costs.  The costs of disconnecting service and removing customer premise equipment from a dwelling and the costs to reconnect a customer drop or to redeploy previously installed customer premise equipment are charged to operating expense as incurred.  Costs for repairs and maintenance are charged to operating expense as incurred, while plant and equipment replacement, including replacement of certain components, betterments, including replacement of cable drops and outlets, are capitalized. \nDepreciation is recorded using the straight-line composite method over management’s estimate of the useful lives of the related assets as follows: \nCable distribution systems\n6\n-\n22\n years\nCustomer premise equipment and installations\n3\n-\n8\n years\nVehicles and equipment\n6\n-\n21\n years\nBuildings and improvements\n8\n-\n40\n years\nFurniture, fixtures and equipment\n2\n-\n10\n years\nThe Company periodically evaluates the estimated useful lives used to depreciate its assets and the estimated amount of assets that will be abandoned or have minimal use in the future.  A significant change in assumptions about the extent or timing of future asset retirements, or in the Company’s use of new technology and upgrade programs, could materially affect future depreciation expense.  Depreciation expense for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $\n7.8\n billion, $\n7.6\n billion, and $\n7.6\n billion, respectively. \nF-10\nCHARTER COMMUNICATIONS, INC.

The Company expects to continually renew its franchise agreements and therefore cannot reasonably estimate any liabilities associated with such agreements. A remote possibility exists that franchise agreements could be terminated unexpectedly, which could result in the Company incurring significant expense in complying with restoration or removal provisions. The Company does not have any significant liabilities related to asset retirements recorded in its consolidated financial statements.\n4.    \nFranchises, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nFranchise rights represent the value attributed to agreements or authorizations with local and state authorities that allow access to homes in cable service areas.  For valuation purposes, they are defined as the future economic benefits of the right to solicit and service potential customers (customer marketing rights), and the right to deploy and market new services to potential customers (service marketing rights).  \nManagement estimates the fair value of franchise rights at the date of acquisition and determines if the franchise has a finite life or an indefinite life.  The Company has concluded that all of its franchises qualify for indefinite life treatment given that there are no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors which limit the period over which these rights will contribute to the Company's cash flows. The Company reassesses this determination periodically or whenever events or substantive changes in circumstances occur. \nAll franchises are tested for impairment annually or more frequently as warranted by events or changes in circumstances.  Franchise assets are aggregated into essentially inseparable units of accounting to conduct valuations.  The franchise units of accounting are geographical clustering of cable systems representing the highest and best use groupings if sold to market participants.  The Company assesses qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that an indefinite lived intangible asset has been impaired.  If, after this optional qualitative assessment, the Company determines that it is not more likely than not that an indefinite lived intangible asset has been impaired, then no further quantitative testing is necessary.  In completing the qualitative impairment testing, the Company evaluates a multitude of factors that affect the fair value of its franchise assets. Examples of such factors include environmental and competitive changes within the Company's operating footprint, actual and projected operating performance, the consistency of its operating margins, equity and debt market trends, including changes in its market capitalization, and changes in its regulatory and political landscape, among other factors.  The Company performed a qualitative assessment in 2024.  After consideration of the qualitative factors in 2024, the Company concluded that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the franchise assets in each unit of accounting exceeds the carrying value of such assets and therefore did not perform a quantitative analysis at the assessment date.  Periodically, the Company may elect to perform a quantitative analysis for impairment testing. If the Company elects or is required to perform a quantitative analysis to test its franchise assets for impairment, the estimated fair value of franchises is determined utilizing an income approach model based on the present value of the estimated discrete future cash flows attributable to each of the intangible assets identified assuming a discount rate.  \nF-11\nCHARTER COMMUNICATIONS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDecember 31, 2024, 2023 AND 2022\n(dollars in millions, except share or per share data or where indicated)\nThe Company has determined that it has one reporting unit for purposes of the assessment of goodwill impairment.  Goodwill is tested for impairment as of November 30 of each year\n,\n or more frequently as warranted by events or changes in circumstances.  Accounting guidance also permits an optional qualitative assessment for goodwill to determine whether it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value.  If, after this qualitative assessment, the Company determines that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount then no further quantitative testing would be necessary.  A quantitative assessment is performed if the qualitative assessment results in a more likely than not determination or if a qualitative assessment is not performed. The quantitative assessment considers whether the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, in which case an impairment charge is recorded to the extent the reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value.  As with the Company’s franchise impairment testing, in 2024 the Company elected to perform a qualitative goodwill impairment assessment, which incorporated consideration of the same qualitative factors relevant to the Company's franchise impairment testing.  As a result of that assessment, the Company concluded that goodwill is not impaired.\nCustomer relationships are recorded at fair value as of the date acquired less accumulated amortization.  Customer relationships are amortized on an accelerated sum of years’ digits method over useful lives of \n10\n-\n15\n years based on the period over which current customers are expected to generate cash flows.  The Company periodically evaluates the remaining useful lives of its customer relationships to determine whether events or circumstances warrant revision to the remaining periods of amortization.  Customer relationships are evaluated for impairment upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.  Customer relationships are deemed impaired when the carrying value exceeds the projected undiscounted future cash flows associated with the customer relationships. No impairment of customer relationships was recorded in the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 or 2022.\nThe Company owns approximately $\n464\n million of Citizens Broadband Radio Service (\"CBRS\") priority access licenses.  The wireless spectrum licenses are considered indefinite life intangible assets recorded in other noncurrent assets on the Company's consolidated balance sheets and payments (including deposits) are presented as an investing cash outflow on the Company’s statements of cash flows.  The Company elected to perform a qualitative impairment assessment in 2024 and concluded that its CBRS priority access licenses are not impaired.\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, indefinite-lived and finite-lived intangible assets are presented in the following table: \nDecember 31,\n2024\n2023\nGross Carrying Amount\nAccumulated Amortization\nNet Carrying Amount\nGross Carrying Amount\nAccumulated Amortization\nNet Carrying Amount\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets:\nFranchises\n$\n67,462\n\n$\n— \n$\n67,462\n\n$\n67,396\n\n$\n— \n$\n67,396\n\nGoodwill\n29,674\n\n— \n29,674\n\n29,668\n\n— \n29,668\n\nWireless spectrum licenses\n464\n\n— \n464\n\n464\n\n— \n464\n\nTrademarks\n159\n\n— \n159\n\n159\n\n— \n159\n\n$\n97,759\n\n$\n— \n$\n97,759\n\n$\n97,687\n\n$\n— \n$\n97,687\n\nFinite-lived intangible assets:\nCustomer relationships\n$\n18,294\n\n$\n(\n17,319\n)\n$\n975\n\n$\n18,268\n\n$\n(\n16,523\n)\n$\n1,745\n\nOther intangible assets\n453\n\n(\n320\n)\n133\n\n450\n\n(\n278\n)\n172\n\n$\n18,747\n\n$\n(\n17,639\n)\n$\n1,108\n\n$\n18,718\n\n$\n(\n16,801\n)\n$\n1,917\n\nAmortization expense related to customer relationships and other intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $\n838\n million, $\n1.1\n billion and $\n1.3\n billion, respectively. \nF-12\nCHARTER COMMUNICATIONS, INC.

The Company applies the equity method to investments when it has the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee.  The Company’s share of the investee’s earnings (losses) is included in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of operations.  The Company monitors its investments for indicators that a decrease in investment value has occurred that is other-than-temporary. If it has been determined that an investment has sustained an other-than-temporary decline in value, the investment is written down to fair value with a charge to earnings.  Investments acquired are measured at fair value utilizing the acquisition method of accounting. The difference between the fair value and the amount of underlying equity in net assets for most equity method investments is due to unrecognized intangible assets at the investee.  These amounts are amortized as a component of equity earnings (losses), recorded within other income (expense), net over the estimated useful life of the asset.\nInvestments consisted of the following as of December 31, 2024 and 2023:\nDecember 31,\n2024\n2023\nEquity method investments\n$\n376\n\n$\n684\n\nOther investments\n142\n\n149\n\nTotal investments\n$\n518\n\n$\n833\n\nEquity method investments primarily includes the Company's 50/50 joint venture with Comcast Corporation (\"Comcast\") in Xumo Services, LLC (\"Xumo\"), a next generation streaming platform.\nThe Company's equity method investments balances reflected in the table above includes differences between the acquisition date fair value of certain investments acquired and the underlying equity in the net assets of the investee, referred to as a basis difference.  This basis difference is amortized as a component of equity earnings.  The remaining unamortized basis difference was $\n240\n million and $\n340\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, net losses from investments were $\n331\n million, $\n343\n million and $\n100\n million, respectively, which were recorded in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations.  Losses on equity investments, net for years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 are primarily related to our joint venture in Xumo.\n\nF-13\nCHARTER COMMUNICATIONS, INC.

The Company has generally extended its payment terms with vendors.  A participating vendor may request a participating financial institution to finance one or more of the Company's payment obligations to such vendor prior to the scheduled due date thereof at a discounted price. The Company is not required to provide collateral to the financial institutions.\nThe Company's obligations to participating vendors, including amounts due and scheduled payment dates, are not impacted by the vendors’ decisions to finance amounts due under these financing arrangements. Cash outflows to the financial institutions are classified as cash flows from operating and investing activities.\nA rollforward of the Company's outstanding payment obligations to participating vendors under its SCF program is summarized as follows for the year ended December 31, 2024 and are included in accounts payable - trade and accrued capital expenditures in the table above: \nBalance, beginning of period\n$\n—\n\nObligations confirmed during the year\n1,454\n\nObligations paid during the year\n(\n878\n)\nBalance, end of period\n$\n576\n\nUnder a deferred payment program, the Company has agreements with third parties specifically for its mobile handset purchases.

The lease agreements include both lease and non-lease components, which the Company accounts for separately depending on the election made for each leased asset class. For real estate and dark fiber leased asset classes, the Company accounts for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component and includes all fixed payments in the measurement of lease liabilities and lease assets.  For colocation facilities leased asset class, the Company accounts for lease and non-lease components separately including only the fixed lease payment component in the measurement of lease liabilities and lease assets.    \nLease assets and lease liabilities are initially recognized based on the present value of the future lease payments over the expected lease term. As for most leases the implicit rate is not readily determinable, the Company uses a discount rate in determining the present value of future payments based on the yield-to-maturity of the Company’s secured publicly traded United States dollars denominated debt instruments interpolating the duration of the debt to the term of the executed lease.  \nThe Company’s leases have base rent periods and some with optional renewal periods.  Leases with base rent periods of less than 12 months are not recorded on the balance sheet.  For purposes of measurement of lease liabilities, the expected lease terms may include renewal options when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise such options.\nOperating lease expenses were $\n516\n million, $\n506\n million and $\n482\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, inclusive of both short-term lease costs and variable lease costs that were not included in the measurement of operating lease liabilities.  \nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of operating lease liabilities, recorded as operating cash flows in the statements of cash flows, were $\n378\n million, $\n369\n million and $\n345\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. \n\nOperating lease right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for operating lease obligations were $\n274\n million, $\n335\n million and $\n221\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nSupplemental balance sheet information related to leases is as follows.\nDecember 31,\n2024\n2023\nOperating lease right-of-use assets:\nIncluded within \nother noncurrent assets\n$\n1,244\n\n$\n1,270\n\nOperating lease liabilities:\nCurrent portion included within \naccounts payable, accrued and other current liabilities\n$\n278\n\n$\n290\n\nLong-term portion included within \nother long-term liabilities\n1,135\n\n1,128\n\n$\n1,413\n\n$\n1,418\n\nWeighted average remaining lease term for operating leases\n5.6\n years\n5.4\n years\nWeighted average discount rate for operating leases\n5.1\n\n%\n4.5\n\n%\nF-15\nCHARTER COMMUNICATIONS, INC.

In the event of specified change of control events, CCO Holdings must offer to purchase the outstanding CCO Holdings notes from the holders at a purchase price equal to \n101\n% of the total principal amount of the notes, plus any accrued and unpaid interest.\nThe indentures governing the CCO Holdings notes contain certain covenants that restrict the ability of CCO Holdings, CCO Holdings Capital Corp. and all of their restricted subsidiaries to: \n•\nincur additional debt;\n•\npay dividends on equity or repurchase equity;\n•\nmake investments;\n•\nsell all or substantially all of their assets or merge with or into other companies;\n•\nsell assets;\n•\nin the case of restricted subsidiaries, create or permit to exist dividend or payment restrictions with respect to CCO Holdings, guarantee their parent companies debt, or issue specified equity interests; \n•\nengage in certain transactions with affiliates; and\n•\ngrant liens (with respect to only CCO Holdings).\nThe above limitations in certain circumstances regarding incurrence of debt, payment of dividends and making investments contained in the indentures of CCO Holdings permit CCO Holdings and its restricted subsidiaries to perform the above, so long as, after giving pro forma effect to the above, the leverage ratio would be below a specified level for the issuer.  The maximum total leverage ratio under the indentures is \n6.0\n to \n1.0\n.  The leverage ratio was \n3.9\n as of December 31, 2024. \nCharter Operating Notes\nThe Charter Operating notes are guaranteed by CCO Holdings and substantially all of the subsidiaries of Charter Operating.

As of December 31, 2024, $\n35\n million of the revolving loans were utilized to collateralize a like principal amount of letters of credit out of $\n425\n million of letters of credit issued on the Company’s behalf.  Amounts outstanding under the Charter Operating credit facilities bear interest, at Charter Operating’s election, at a base rate, SOFR, as defined, plus an applicable margin. SOFR was \n4.3\n% and \n5.4\n% as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.  \nThe Charter Operating credit facilities also allow us to enter into incremental term loans in the future, with amortization as set forth in the notices establishing such term loans.  Although the Charter Operating credit facilities allow for the incurrence of a certain amount of incremental term loans subject to pro forma compliance with its financial maintenance covenants, no assurance can be given that the Company could obtain additional incremental term loans in the future if Charter Operating sought to do so or what amount of incremental term loans would be allowable at any given time under the terms of the Charter Operating credit facilities.\nThe obligations of Charter Operating under the Charter Operating credit facilities are guaranteed by CCO Holdings and substantially all of the subsidiaries of Charter Operating.  The obligations are also secured by (i) a lien on substantially all of the assets of Charter Operating and substantially all of its subsidiaries, to the extent such lien can be perfected under the Uniform Commercial Code by the filing of a financing statement, and (ii) a pledge of the equity interests directly or indirectly owned by Charter Operating in substantially all of its subsidiaries, as well as intercompany obligations owing to it and the guarantor subsidiaries by any of their affiliates.\nThe Charter Operating credit facilities contain representations and warranties, and customary affirmative and negative covenants, including restrictions on the ability of Charter Operating or any of its subsidiaries to incur liens securing indebtedness for borrowed money and on the ability of Charter Operating to consolidate, merge or convey or transfer substantially all of its assets.  The financial covenants measure performance against standards set for leverage to be tested as of the end of each quarter.  The Charter Operating credit facilities also contain customary events of default and the right to cure with respect to any defaults or events of default.\nAt December 31, 2024, Charter Operating had a consolidated leverage ratio of approximately \n2.7\n and a consolidated first lien leverage ratio of \n2.7\n.  Both ratios are in compliance with the ratios required by the Charter Operating credit facilities of \n5.0\n to \nF-18\nCHARTER COMMUNICATIONS, INC.

A failure by Charter Operating to maintain the financial covenants would result in an event of default under the Charter Operating credit facilities and the debt of CCO Holdings.  \nTime Warner Cable, LLC Notes and Debentures\nThe Time Warner Cable, LLC (\"TWC, LLC\") senior notes and debentures are guaranteed by CCO Holdings, Charter Operating and substantially all of the subsidiaries of Charter Operating (other than TWC, LLC) and rank equally with the liens on the collateral securing obligations under the Charter Operating notes and credit facilities.  Interest on each series of TWC, LLC senior notes and debentures is payable semi-annually (with the exception of the Sterling Notes, which is payable annually) in arrears. \nThe TWC, LLC indentures contain customary covenants relating to restrictions on the ability of TWC, LLC or any of its  material subsidiaries to incur liens securing indebtedness for borrowed money and on the ability of TWC, LLC and Time Warner Cable Enterprises LLC (\"TWCE\") to consolidate, merge or convey or transfer substantially all of their assets. The TWC, LLC indentures also contain customary events of default.\nThe TWC, LLC senior notes and debentures may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time at TWC, LLC’s option at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) all of the applicable principal amount being redeemed and (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments on the applicable TWC, LLC senior notes and debentures discounted to the redemption date on a semi-annual basis (with the exception of the Sterling Notes, which are on an annual basis), at a comparable government bond rate plus a designated number of basis points as further described in the indenture and the applicable note or debenture, plus, in each case, accrued but unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date.\nThe Company may offer to redeem all, but not less than all, of the Sterling Notes in the event of certain changes in the tax laws of the U.S. (or any taxing authority in the U.S.). This redemption would be at a redemption price equal to \n100\n% of the principal amount, together with accrued and unpaid interest on the Sterling Notes to, but not including, the redemption date.\nTWCE Debentures\nThe TWCE senior debentures are guaranteed by CCO Holdings, Charter Operating, and substantially all of the subsidiaries of Charter Operating (other than TWCE) and rank equally with the liens on the collateral securing obligations under the Charter Operating notes and credit facilities.  Interest on each series of TWCE senior debentures is payable semi-annually in arrears. The TWCE senior debentures are not redeemable before maturity.\nThe TWCE indentures contain customary covenants relating to restrictions on the ability of TWC, LLC, TWCE or any of its subsidiaries to incur liens securing indebtedness for borrowed money and on the ability of TWC, LLC and TWCE to consolidate, merge or convey or transfer substantially all of their assets. The TWCE indentures also contain customary events of default. \nLimitations on Distributions\nDistributions by the Company’s subsidiaries to a parent company for payment of principal on parent company notes are restricted under the CCO Holdings indentures discussed above, unless there is no default under the applicable indenture, and unless CCO Holdings’ leverage ratio test is met at the time of such distribution.  As of December 31, 2024, there was no default under any of these indentures and CCO Holdings met its applicable leverage ratio tests based on December 31, 2024 financial results. There can be no assurance that CCO Holdings will satisfy these tests at the time of the contemplated distribution.\nIn addition to the limitation on distributions under the various indentures, distributions by the Company’s subsidiaries may be limited by applicable law, including the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act, under which the Company’s subsidiaries may make distributions if they have “surplus” as defined in the act.\nF-19\nCHARTER COMMUNICATIONS, INC.

As set forth below, the Company has significant future principal and interest payments.  The Company continues to monitor the capital markets, and it expects to undertake refinancing transactions and utilize free cash flow and cash on hand to further extend or reduce the maturities of its principal obligations.  The timing and terms of any refinancing transactions will be subject to market conditions.  \nInterest payments on variable debt are estimated using amounts outstanding at December 31, 2024 and the average implied forward SOFR rates applicable for the quarter during the interest rate reset based on the yield curve in effect at December 31, 2024.  Actual interest payments will differ based on actual SOFR rates and actual amounts outstanding for applicable periods.  \nBased upon outstanding indebtedness as of December 31, 2024, the amortization of term loans, and the maturity dates for all senior and subordinated notes, total future principal and interest payments on the total borrowings under all debt agreements are as follows.   \nPrincipal\nInterest\n2025\n$\n2,105\n\n$\n4,844\n\n2026\n2,155\n\n4,704\n\n2027\n3,554\n\n4,517\n\n2028\n5,392\n\n4,302\n\n2029\n7,279\n\n4,036\n\nThereafter \n73,294\n\n38,534\n\n$\n93,779\n\n$\n60,937\n\n9.    \nEquipment Installment Plan Financing Facility\nIn June 2024, a bankruptcy remote special purpose vehicle and consolidated subsidiary of the Company, CCO EIP Financing, LLC, (the “SPV Borrower”) entered into a senior secured revolving credit facility to finance the purchase of equipment installment plan receivables (“EIP Receivables”) with a number of financial institutions (the “EIP Financing Facility”). \nThe revolving credit facility under the EIP Financing Facility bears interest on the outstanding borrowings based on lenders’ cost of funds plus an applicable margin and was \n5.78\n% as of December 31, 2024.  The EIP Financing Facility has a final maturity date of June 20, 2028, comprised of a one-year revolving loan period, subject to annual renewal, and if not renewed, cash flows on EIP Receivables are applied to amortize the loan which may occur over a period of up to three years. SPV Borrower may borrow up to $\n1.25\n billion under the EIP Financing Facility.  As of December 31, 2024, the carrying value of the EIP Financing Facility was $\n1.1\n billion and is included in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. \nThe SPV Borrower’s sole business consists of the purchase or acceptance through capital contributions of the EIP Receivables from Spectrum Mobile Equipment, LLC, (the sole direct parent entity of SPV Borrower that originates the EIP Receivables) and the subsequent retransfer of or granting of a security interest in such EIP Receivables to the administrative agent under the EIP Financing Facility.  The SPV Borrower is a separate legal entity with its own separate creditors who will be entitled, upon its liquidation, to be satisfied out of the SPV Borrower’s assets prior to any assets or value in the SPV Borrower becoming available to the SPV Borrower’s equity holders, and the assets of the SPV Borrower are not available to pay creditors of any other affiliate of the Company. \nThe EIP Financing Facility is accounted for on a consolidated basis as a secured borrowing. As of December 31, 2024, pledged EIP Receivables with an unpaid principal balance of $\n1.6\n billion, included in accounts receivable, net and other noncurrent assets, and restricted cash of $\n47\n million, included in prepaid expenses and other current assets, are held by the SPV Borrower and reflected in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. Receipts from mobile customers related to the underlying EIP Receivables are reflected as cash flows from operating activities and borrowings and repayments under the EIP Financing Facility are reflected as cash flows from financing activities in the Company’s consolidated statements of cash flows.\nF-20\nCHARTER COMMUNICATIONS, INC.

The Company accounts for treasury stock using the cost method and includes treasury stock as a component of total shareholders’ equity.  Upon retirement, these treasury shares are allocated between additional paid-in capital and accumulated deficit based on the cost of original issue included in additional paid-in capital.\n11.    \nNoncontrolling Interests\nNoncontrolling interests represents consolidated subsidiaries of which the Company owns less than \n100\n%.  The Company is a holding company whose principal asset is a controlling equity interest in Charter Holdings, the indirect owner of the Company’s cable systems.  Noncontrolling interests on the Company’s balance sheet primarily includes A/N’s equity interests in Charter Holdings, which is comprised of a common ownership interest. \nAs of December 31, 2024, A/N held \n16.5\n million Charter Holdings common units which are exchangeable at any time into either Charter Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis, or, at Charter’s option, cash, based on the then current market price of Charter Class A common stock. Net income of Charter Holdings attributable to A/N’s common noncontrolling interest for financial reporting purposes is based on the weighted average effective common ownership interest of approximately \n10\n% to \n11\n% and was $\n767\n million, $\n702\n million and $\n792\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.  Charter Holdings is required to make quarterly cash tax distributions (with annual true-ups) on a pro rata basis to its partners based on the partner with the highest proportionate cash tax requirement.  To the extent such tax distributions would exceed Charter’s cash tax requirements, it may waive its entitlement to tax distributions and, instead, issue a non-pro rata \"advance\" to A/N, which will accrue interest at the interest rate applicable to Charter Operating’s revolving credit facility and will reduce A/N’s exchange value into cash or Charter Class A common stock.  Charter Holdings distributed $\n155\n million, $\n156\n million and $\n110\n million to A/N as a pro rata tax distribution on its common units during the years ended December 31, 2024,  2023 and 2022, respectively.  \nThe following table represents Charter Holdings' purchase of Charter Holdings common units from A/N pursuant to the A/N Letter Agreement (see Note 18) and the effect on total shareholders' equity during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNumber of units purchased\n589,319\n\n1,079,322\n\n3,171,681\n\nAmount of units purchased\n$\n189\n\n$\n427\n\n$\n1,602\n\nDecrease in noncontrolling interest based on carrying value\n$\n(\n138\n)\n$\n(\n240\n)\n$\n(\n700\n)\nDecrease in additional paid-in-capital, net of tax\n$\n(\n38\n)\n$\n(\n140\n)\n$\n(\n681\n)\nF-22\nCHARTER COMMUNICATIONS, INC.

The cross-currency swaps have maturities of June 2031 and July 2042. \nThe Company’s derivative instruments are not designated as hedges and are marked to fair value each period, with the impact recorded as a gain or loss on financial instruments in the consolidated statements of operations in other income (expense), net.  While these derivative instruments are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes, management continues to believe such instruments are closely correlated with the respective debt, thus managing associated risk.\n  The fair value of the Company's cross-currency derivatives, which are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy, was $\n504\n million and $\n440\n million and is included in other long-term liabilities on its consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.   \nThe effect of financial instruments are recorded in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations and consisted of the following.\n\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nChange in fair value of cross-currency derivative instruments \n$\n(\n64\n)\n$\n130\n\n$\n(\n280\n)\nForeign currency remeasurement of Sterling Notes to U.S. dollars\n30\n\n(\n85\n)\n185\n\nGain (loss) on financial instruments, net\n$\n(\n34\n)\n$\n45\n\n$\n(\n95\n)\nF-23\nCHARTER COMMUNICATIONS, INC.

Mobile services are sold under unlimited data plans or by-the-gig data usage plans.  The Company often provides multiple services to a customer.  The transaction price for a bundle of services may be less than the sum of the standalone selling prices of each individual service.  The Company allocates the bundle discount among the services to which the discount relates based on the relative standalone selling prices of those services. Generally, directly observable standalone selling prices are used for the revenue allocation.  Customers are invoiced for subscription services in advance of the service period.  Each subscription service provided is accounted for as a distinct performance obligation and revenue is recognized ratably over the monthly service period as the subscription services are delivered. Residential customers may generally cancel their subscriptions at the end of their monthly service period without penalty.  Each optional service purchased is generally accounted for as a distinct performance obligation when purchased and revenue is recognized when the service is provided.  Performance obligations relating to services provided by third-party content providers where the Company does not control the delivery of the services are presented net of costs paid because the Company is acting as an agent in such situations.  \nFor customer premise equipment (\"CPE\") where such CPE would qualify as a lease, the Company combines the operating lease with the subscription service revenue as a single performance obligation as the subscription service is the predominant component.  Installation fees are deferred over the period the fee remains material to the customer, which the Company has estimated to be approximately six months.  Sales commission costs are expensed as incurred as the amortization period is less than one year.  Right-of-entry costs represent upfront costs incurred related to agreements entered into with multiple dwelling units (“MDUs”) including landlords, real estate companies or owners to gain access to a building in order to market and service customers who reside in the building.  Right-of-entry costs are deferred as contract fulfillment costs and recognized over the term of the contracts.\nCustomers can purchase mobile equipment, including devices and accessory products, and have the option to pay for devices under interest-free monthly installment plans.  The Company does not impute interest on equipment installment plans sold through its direct channel as the inherent financing component is not considered significant based on the commercial objective of the plans, interest rates prevailing in the marketplace and credit risks of the Company's customers.  The sale of equipment is a separate performance obligation, therefore, revenue is recognized from the sale of equipment upon delivery and acceptance by the customer. \nFees imposed on the Company by various governmental authorities are passed through on a monthly basis to the Company’s customers and are periodically remitted to authorities. Fees of $\n941\n million, $\n993\n million and $\n1.1\n billion for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, are reported in revenues on a gross basis with a corresponding operating \nF-24\nCHARTER COMMUNICATIONS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDecember 31, 2024, 2023 AND 2022\n(dollars in millions, except share or per share data or where indicated)\nexpense because the Company is acting as a principal.  Certain taxes, such as sales taxes imposed on the Company’s customers, collected and remitted to state and local authorities are recorded on a net basis because the Company is acting as an agent in such situations.  \nCommercial Services\nSmall and medium business (\"SMB\") customers are offered Internet, video, mobile and voice services similar to those provided to residential customers. SMB customers may generally cancel their subscriptions at the end of their monthly service period without penalty.  Each subscription service provided is accounted for as a distinct performance obligation and revenue is recognized ratably over the monthly service period as the subscription services are delivered. \nServices to enterprise clients include more tailored communications products and managed service solutions to larger businesses, as well as high-capacity last-mile data connectivity services to mobile and wireline carriers on a wholesale basis. Services are primarily offered on a subscription basis with a contractually specified and non-cancelable service period, which is generally one to seven years with a weighted average term of approximately three years. Each subscription service provided is accounted for as a distinct performance obligation and revenue is recognized ratably over the contract period as the subscription services are delivered.  Enterprise subscription services are billed as monthly recurring charges to customers and related installation services, if applicable, are billed upon completion of the customer installation.  Installation services are not accounted for as distinct performance obligations, but rather a component of the connectivity services, and therefore upfront installation fees are deferred and recognized as revenue over the related contract period.  Enterprise sales commission costs are deferred and recognized using a portfolio approach over a weighted-average contract period.  \nAdvertising Services\nThe Company offers local, regional and national businesses the opportunity to advertise in individual and multiple service areas on cable television networks and digital outlets. Placement of advertising is accounted for as a distinct performance obligation and revenue is recognized at the point in time when the advertising is distributed.  In some service areas, the Company has formed advertising interconnects or entered into representation agreements with other video distributors, under which the Company sells advertising on behalf of those distributors. In other service areas, the Company has entered into representation agreements under which another operator in the area will sell advertising on the Company’s behalf. For representation arrangements in which the Company controls the sale of advertising and acts as the principal to the transaction, the Company recognizes revenue earned from the advertising customer on a gross basis and the amount remitted to the distributor as an operating expense. For other representation arrangements in which the Company does not control the sale of advertising and acts as an agent to the transaction, the Company recognizes revenue net of any fee remitted to the distributor.\nOther balances that are not separately presented on the consolidated balance sheets that relate to the recognition of revenue and collection of the related cash, as well as the deferred costs associated with our contracts with customers consist of the following for the periods presented:\nDecember 31,\n2024\n2023\nAccounts receivable, net:\nEquipment installment plan receivables, net\n$\n967\n\n$\n673\n\nOther noncurrent assets:\nEquipment installment plan receivables, net\n$\n980\n\n$\n687\n\nContract acquisition and fulfillment costs\n$\n701\n\n$\n616\n\nAccounts payables, accrued and other current liabilities:\nCustomer prepayments and upfront deferred installation fees\n$\n456\n\n$\n509\n\nF-25\nCHARTER COMMUNICATIONS, INC.

The CODM assesses performance and allocates resources based on the Company’s consolidated statements of operations, as the converged network requires the CODM to manage and evaluate the results of the business in a consolidated manner to drive efficiencies and develop uniform strategies. Accordingly, key components and processes of the Company’s operations are managed centrally, including contracting for programming, capital and new technology development and deployment, plant engineering, customer service, marketing, legal and government affairs. Segment asset information is not used by the CODM to allocate resources.  Under this organizational and reporting structure, the Company has \none\n reportable segment.\nAs a single reportable segment entity, the Company’s segment performance measure is net income attributable to Charter shareholders. See Note 13 for a description of the Company's disaggregated revenues by product line.  Significant segment expenses are presented in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations.  \nAdditional disaggregated significant segment expenses on a functional basis, that are not separately presented on the Company’s consolidated statements of operations, are presented below.  \nOperating Costs and Expenses\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nProgramming\n$\n9,653\n\n$\n10,638\n\n$\n11,620\n\nOther costs of revenue\n6,351\n\n5,587\n\n4,804\n\nField and technology operations\n5,083\n\n5,113\n\n4,793\n\nCustomer operations\n3,221\n\n3,302\n\n3,294\n\nSales and marketing\n3,714\n\n3,653\n\n3,585\n\nStock compensation expense (see Note 15)\n651\n\n692\n\n470\n\nOther\n4,494\n\n4,420\n\n4,310\n\n$\n33,167\n\n$\n33,405\n\n$\n32,876\n\nProgramming costs consist primarily of costs paid to programmers for basic, premium, video on demand and pay-per-view programming.

The stock incentive plan allows for the issuance of up to \n23\n million shares of Charter Class A common stock (or units convertible into Charter Class A common stock).\nRestricted stock, restricted stock units, stock options as well as equity awards with market conditions are measured at the grant date fair value and amortized to stock compensation expense over the requisite service period.  The fair value of stock options is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and the fair value of equity awards with market conditions is estimated on the date of grant using Monte Carlo simulations.  The grant date weighted average assumptions used during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 were: risk-free interest rate of \n3.9\n%, \n3.7\n% and \n1.7\n%, respectively; expected lives of \n5.0\n years, \n4.8\n years and \n5.7\n years, respectively; and expected volatility of \n33\n%, \n31\n% and \n28\n%, respectively.  The Company’s volatility assumptions represent management’s best estimate and were based on a review of historical and implied volatility.  Expected lives were estimated using historical exercise data.  The valuations assume no dividends are paid.  The Company has elected an accounting policy to assume zero forfeitures for stock awards grants and account for forfeitures when they occur.\nStock options and restricted stock units generally cliff vest \nthree years\n from the date of grant.  Certain stock options and restricted stock units vest based on achievement of stock price hurdles.  Stock options generally expire \nten years\n from the grant date and restricted stock units have no voting rights.  Restricted stock generally vests \none year\n from the date of grant.  \nAs of December 31, 2024, total unrecognized compensation remaining to be recognized in future periods totaled $\n276\n million for stock options, $\n1\n million for restricted stock and $\n396\n million for restricted stock units and the weighted average period \nF-27\nCHARTER COMMUNICATIONS, INC.

Valuation allowances are established when management determines that it is more likely than not that some portion or the entire deferred tax asset will not be realized.  In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, management takes into account various factors, including the expected level of future taxable income, available tax planning strategies and reversals of existing taxable temporary differences. The impact on deferred taxes of changes in tax rates and tax law, if any, applied to the years during which temporary differences are expected to be settled, are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period of enactment.  In determining the Company’s tax provision for financial reporting purposes, the Company establishes a reserve for uncertain tax positions unless such positions are determined to be “more likely than not” of being sustained upon examination, based on their technical merits. There is considerable judgment involved in making such a determination.  The Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued on uncertain income tax positions as part of the income tax provision.\n\nSubstantially all of the Company’s operations are held through Charter Holdings and its direct and indirect subsidiaries. Charter Holdings and the majority of its subsidiaries are generally limited liability companies that are not subject to income tax. However, certain of these limited liability companies are subject to state income tax. In addition, the subsidiaries that are corporations are subject to income tax. Generally, the taxable income, gains, losses, deductions and credits of Charter Holdings are passed through to its members, Charter and A/N. Charter is responsible for its share of taxable income or loss of Charter Holdings allocated to it in accordance with the Charter Holdings Limited Liability Company Agreement (“LLC Agreement”) and partnership tax rules and regulations. As a result, Charter's primary deferred tax component recorded in the consolidated balance sheets relates to its excess financial reporting outside basis, excluding amounts attributable to nondeductible goodwill, over Charter's tax basis in the investment in Charter Holdings.\nCharter Holdings, the indirect owner of the Company’s cable systems, generally allocates its taxable income, gains, losses, deductions and credits proportionately according to the members’ respective ownership interests, except for special allocations required under Section 704(c) of the Internal Revenue Code and the Treasury Regulations (“Section 704(c)”).  Pursuant to Section 704(c) and the LLC Agreement, each item of income, gain, loss and deduction with respect to any property contributed to the capital of the partnership shall, solely for tax purposes, be allocated among the members so as to take into account any variation between the adjusted basis of such property to the partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and its initial gross asset value using the “traditional method” as described in the Treasury Regulations.\nF-29\nCHARTER COMMUNICATIONS, INC.

(“TWC”).  In addition, Charter has state tax net operating loss carryforwards that generally expire in the years 2025 through 2042.  Charter's federal tax loss carryforwards are subject to Section 382 and other restrictions.  Also included in carryforwards is Charter's Section 163(j) interest limitation, which is based on interest expense that is not deductible in the current year due to taxable income limitations.  The limited interest has an indefinite carryforward period and will become deductible when Charter generates taxable income sufficient to overcome the limitation.\nTax Receivable Agreement\nUnder the LLC Agreement, A/N has the right to exchange at any time some or all of its common units in Charter Holdings for Charter’s Class A common stock or cash, at Charter’s option. Pursuant to a Tax Receivable Agreement (\"TRA\") between Charter and A/N, Charter must pay to A/N \n50\n% of the tax benefit when realized by Charter from the step-up in tax basis resulting from any future exchange or sale of the common units.  Charter did not record a liability for this obligation as of the acquisition date since the tax benefit is dependent on uncertain future events that are outside of Charter’s control, such as the timing of a conversion or exchange. A future exchange or sale is not based on a fixed and determinable date and the exchange or sale is not certain to occur. If all of A/N's partnership units were to be exchanged or sold in the future, the undiscounted value of the obligation is currently estimated to be in the range of \nzero\n to $\n3.5\n billion depending on measurement of the tax step-up in the future and Charter’s ability to realize the tax benefit in the periods following the exchange or sale.  Factors impacting these calculations include, but are not limited to, the fair value of the equity at the time of the exchange and the effective tax rates when the benefits are realized.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nThe net amount of the unrecognized tax benefits recorded as of December 31, 2024 that could impact the effective tax rate is $\n604\n million.

Under these agreements, Charter, Spectrum Management and Charter Holdco provide management services for the cable systems owned or operated by their subsidiaries.  Costs associated with providing these services are charged directly to the Company’s operating subsidiaries.  All other costs incurred on behalf of Charter’s operating subsidiaries are considered a part of the management fee.  These costs are recorded as a component of operating costs and expenses, in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.  The management fee charged to the Company’s operating subsidiaries approximated the expenses incurred by Spectrum Management, Charter Holdco and Charter on behalf of the Company’s operating subsidiaries in 2024, 2023 and 2022.  \nLiberty Broadband and A/N\nUnder the terms of the Second Amended and Restated Stockholders Agreement among Charter, Liberty Broadband and A/N, dated as of May 23, 2015 (the “Existing Stockholders Agreement”), as amended by Amendment No. 1 to the Second Amended and Restated Stockholders Agreement and the Letter Agreement, dated as of November 12, 2024 (the “Stockholders and Letter Agreement Amendment”), the number of Charter’s directors is fixed at 13.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDecember 31, 2024, 2023 AND 2022\n(dollars in millions, except share or per share data or where indicated)\ncurrently comprised of three unaffiliated directors and one designee of each of A/N and Liberty Broadband. A/N and Liberty Broadband also have certain other committee designation and governance rights.  A description of the terms of the Stockholders and Letter Agreement Amendment is set forth below under “Stockholders and Letter Agreement Amendment.”\nIn December 2016, Charter and A/N entered into a letter agreement, as amended in December 2017 (the “A/N Letter Agreement”) that requires A/N to sell to Charter or to Charter Holdings, on a monthly basis, a number of shares of Charter Class A common stock or Charter Holdings common units that represents a pro rata participation by A/N and its affiliates in any repurchases of shares of Charter Class A common stock from persons other than A/N effected by Charter during the immediately preceding calendar month, at a purchase price equal to the average price paid by Charter for the shares repurchased from persons other than A/N during such immediately preceding calendar month. A/N and Charter both have the right to terminate or suspend the pro rata repurchase arrangement on a prospective basis. Pursuant to the TRA between Charter and A/N, Charter must pay to A/N \n50\n% of the tax benefit when realized by Charter from the step-up in tax basis resulting from any future exchange or sale of the common units.  See Note 16 for more information. \nIn February 2021, Charter and Liberty Broadband entered into a letter agreement (the “Existing LBB Letter Agreement”), as amended by the Stockholders and Letter Agreement Amendment. The Existing LBB Letter Agreement implemented Liberty Broadband’s obligations under the Existing Stockholders Agreement to participate in share repurchases by Charter.  Under the Existing LBB Letter Agreement, Liberty Broadband sold to Charter, generally on a monthly basis, a number of shares of Charter Class A common stock representing an amount sufficient for Liberty Broadband’s ownership of Charter to be reduced such that it did not exceed the ownership cap then applicable to Liberty Broadband under the Existing Stockholders Agreement at a purchase price per share equal to the volume weighted average price per share paid by Charter for shares repurchased during such immediately preceding calendar month other than (i) purchases from A/N, (ii) purchases in privately negotiated transactions or (iii) purchases for the withholding of shares of Charter Class A common stock pursuant to equity compensation programs of Charter.  The Existing LBB Letter Agreement was amended on November 12, 2024 pursuant to the Stockholders and Letter Agreement Amendment as described below under “Stockholders and Letter Agreement Amendment.”  \nGregory Maffei, a director of Charter and former President and CEO and director and holder of a \n3.7\n% voting interest in Liberty Broadband, is Chairman of the board of directors of Qurate Retail, Inc. (\"Qurate\") and Dr. John Malone, Chairman of the board of directors of Liberty Broadband and holder of a \n48.5\n% voting interest in Liberty Broadband, also serves on the Qurate board of directors.  As reported in SEC filings of Qurate, Mr. Maffei and Dr. Malone, Mr. Maffei has ownership of an approximate \n18.5\n% voting interest in Qurate and Dr. Malone has ownership of an approximate \n6.5\n% voting interest in Qurate.  Qurate wholly owns HSN, Inc. (“HSN”) and QVC, Inc. (“QVC”).  The Company has programming relationships with HSN and QVC.  For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded revenue in aggregate of approximately $\n48\n million, $\n47\n million and $\n43\n million, respectively, from HSN and QVC as part of channel carriage fees and revenue sharing arrangements for home shopping sales made to customers in the Company’s footprint.  \nLiberty Broadband Combination\nOn November 12, 2024, Charter, Liberty Broadband, Fusion Merger Sub 1, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Charter, and Fusion Merger Sub 2, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Fusion Merger Sub 1, LLC, entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (as it may be amended or supplemented from time to time, the “merger agreement”), pursuant to which, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, Charter will acquire Liberty Broadband through the merger of Fusion Merger Sub 2, Inc. with and into Liberty Broadband (the “merger”), with Liberty Broadband surviving the merger and becoming an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Charter.  Immediately following the merger, Liberty Broadband, as the surviving corporation of the merger, will merge with and into Fusion Merger Sub 1, LLC (the “upstream merger” and together with the merger, the “combination”), with Fusion Merger Sub 1, LLC surviving the upstream merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Charter. \nAt the effective time of the merger (the “effective time”):\n•\neach share of (i) Liberty Broadband Series A common stock, par value $\n0.01\n per share (“Liberty Broadband Series A common stock”), (ii) Liberty Broadband Series B common stock, par value $\n0.01\n per share (“Liberty Broadband Series B common stock”), and (iii) Liberty Broadband Series C common stock, par value $\n0.01\n per share (“Liberty Broadband Series C common stock” and together with the Liberty Broadband Series A common stock and the Liberty Broadband Series B common stock, the “Liberty Broadband common stock”), in each case, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (other than certain excluded shares as set forth in the merger agreement) will be converted into the \nF-34\nCHARTER COMMUNICATIONS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDecember 31, 2024, 2023 AND 2022\n(dollars in millions, except share or per share data or where indicated)\nright to receive \n0.236\n of a validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of Charter Class A common stock, par value $\n0.001\n per share (“Charter Class A common stock”); and\n•\neach share of Liberty Broadband Series A cumulative redeemable preferred stock, par value $\n0.01\n per share (“Liberty Broadband preferred stock”), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (other than excluded treasury shares as set forth in the merger agreement) will be converted into the right to receive one share of newly issued Charter Series A cumulative redeemable preferred stock, par value $\n0.001\n per share (“Charter preferred stock”). The Charter preferred stock will have substantially identical terms to the Liberty Broadband preferred stock, including a mandatory redemption date of March 8, 2039.  \nAs of December 31, 2024, Liberty Broadband’s principal assets currently consist of approximately \n45.3\n million shares of Charter Class A common stock and its subsidiary GCI, LLC, which is comprised of one operating entity, GCI Holdings, LLC (“GCI”), Alaska’s largest communications provider.  Pursuant to the merger agreement, Liberty Broadband has agreed to spin off GCI by way of a distribution to the stockholders of Liberty Broadband prior to the closing of the Merger Transaction.  The GCI distribution is expected to be taxable to Liberty Broadband and its stockholders, with Charter bearing the corporate level tax liability upon completion of the combination.  However, to the extent such corporate level tax liability exceeds $\n420\n million, Charter will be entitled under a tax receivables agreement to the portion of the tax benefits realized by GCI corresponding to such excess.  The companies currently expect the transaction to close on June 30, 2027, unless otherwise agreed, subject to the completion of the GCI spin-off and other customary closing conditions. \nFor additional information, see the definitive joint proxy statement/prospectus with respect to the combination, filed by Charter on January 22, 2025, including the sections entitled “The Combination” and “The Merger Agreement” included therein.\nVoting Agreements\nIn connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, on November 12, 2024, Dr. Malone’s affiliated holders of shares of Liberty Broadband common stock and Liberty Broadband preferred stock (collectively, the “Malone Group) entered into a voting agreement with Charter and Liberty Broadband, pursuant to which, subject to certain conditions, the Malone Group has committed to vote its shares of Liberty Broadband common stock and Liberty Broadband preferred stock representing approximately \n48.5\n% of the total voting power of the issued and outstanding shares of Liberty Broadband common stock and Liberty Broadband preferred stock, in the aggregate, in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and the approval of the transactions contemplated thereby.\nIn addition, on November 12, 2024, Gregory B. Maffei and certain related holders of shares of Liberty Broadband common stock and Liberty Broadband preferred stock (collectively, the “Maffei Group”) entered into a voting agreement with Charter and Liberty Broadband, pursuant to which, subject to certain conditions, the Maffei Group has committed to vote its shares of Liberty Broadband common stock and Liberty Broadband preferred stock representing approximately \n3.7\n% of the total voting power of the issued and outstanding shares of Liberty Broadband common stock and Liberty Broadband preferred stock, in the aggregate, in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and the approval of the transactions contemplated thereby.\nFor additional information, see the definitive joint proxy statement/prospectus with respect to the combination, filed by Charter on January 22, 2025, including the sections entitled “The Combination,” “The Merger Agreement,” “Other Agreements Related to the Combination - Malone Voting Agreement” and “Other Agreements Related to the Combination - Maffei Voting Agreement” included therein.\nStockholders and Letter Agreement Amendment\nSimultaneously with the entry into the merger agreement, Charter, Liberty Broadband and A/N entered into the Stockholders and Letter Agreement Amendment to amend (i) the Existing Stockholders Agreement and (ii) the Existing LBB Letter Agreement.  The Stockholders and Letter Agreement Amendment sets forth, among other things, the terms of Liberty Broadband’s participation in Charter’s share repurchases during the period between the execution of the merger agreement and the effective time of the merger agreement. Pursuant to the Stockholders and Letter Agreement Amendment, each month during the pendency of the proposed transaction, Charter will repurchase shares of Charter Class A common stock from Liberty Broadband in an amount equal to the greater of (i) $\n100\n million and (ii) the Liberty Broadband minimum liquidity threshold as set forth in the Stockholders and Letter Agreement Amendment, provided that if any repurchase would reduce Liberty \nF-35\nCHARTER COMMUNICATIONS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDecember 31, 2024, 2023 AND 2022\n(dollars in millions, except share or per share data or where indicated)\nBroadband’s equity interest in Charter below \n25.25\n% after giving effect to such repurchase or if all or a portion of such repurchase is not permitted under applicable law, then Charter shall instead loan to Liberty Broadband an amount equal to the lesser of (x) the repurchase amount that cannot be repurchased and (y) the Liberty Broadband minimum liquidity threshold as set forth in the Stockholders and Letter Agreement Amendment less the repurchase amount that is repurchased, with such loan on the terms set forth in the Stockholders and Letter Agreement Amendment.  From and after the date Liberty Broadband’s exchangeable debentures are no longer outstanding, the amount of monthly repurchases will be the lesser of (i) $\n100\n million and (ii) an amount equal to the sum of (x) the amount needed in the reasonable judgment of Charter to maintain unrestricted cash balance of Liberty Broadband and its subsidiaries (other than GCI, GCI Spinco and their respective subsidiaries) or $50 million plus (y) the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Liberty Broadband margin loan.  The purchase price payable by Charter to Liberty Broadband in connection with such monthly repurchases will equal (i) the average price paid by Charter for shares of Charter Class A common stock repurchased during the immediately preceding calendar month (excluding shares repurchased from A/N and certain other excluded repurchases) or (ii) if Charter has not engaged in any repurchases of shares of Charter Class A common stock during the immediately preceding calendar month (other than any repurchases from A/N and certain other excluded repurchases), a purchase price based on a Bloomberg volume-weighted average price methodology proposed by Charter and reasonably acceptable to Liberty Broadband. Liberty Broadband will apply the proceeds from any such repurchases or borrowings from Charter to repay certain of its outstanding indebtedness in accordance with the Stockholders and Letter Agreement Amendment. The Stockholders and Letter Agreement Amendment provides that Liberty Broadband will be exempt from the standstill restrictions and the ownership cap under the Existing Stockholders Agreement to the extent its ownership in Charter exceeds such ownership cap solely as a result of the repurchase provisions in the Stockholders and Letter Agreement Amendment.\nFor additional information, see the definitive joint proxy statement/prospectus with respect to the combination, filed by Charter on January 22, 2025, including the sections entitled “The Combination,” “The Merger Agreement” and “Other Agreements Related to the Combination - Stockholders and Letter Agreement Amendment” included therein.\nOther Agreements\nSimultaneously with the entry into the merger agreement, certain additional related agreements were entered into by Charter and Liberty Broadband, including:\n•\nAn Assumption and Joinder Agreement to Tax Sharing Agreement, by and among Charter, Liberty Broadband, Grizzly Merger Sub 1, LLC (successor to GCI Liberty, Inc.) (“Grizzly Merger Sub”) and Qurate, pursuant to which Charter agrees to assume, effective at the Effective Time, Liberty Broadband’s rights and obligations under the Tax Sharing Agreement, dated as of March 9, 2018, by and between Qurate and Grizzly Merger Sub; and\n•\nAn Assumption and Joinder Agreement to Indemnification Agreement, by and among Charter, Liberty Broadband, Grizzly Merger Sub, LV Bridge, LLC, Qurate and Liberty Interactive LLC, pursuant to which Charter agrees to assume, effective at the Effective Time, Liberty Broadband’s rights and obligations under the Indemnification Agreement, dated as of March 9, 2018, by and among Grizzly Merger Sub, Qurate, Liberty Interactive LLC and LV Bridge, LLC.\nFor additional information, see the definitive joint proxy statement/prospectus with respect to the combination, filed by Charter on January 22, 2025, including the sections entitled “The Combination,” “The Merger Agreement” and “Other Agreements Related to the Combination - Additional Transaction Agreements” included therein.\nEquity Investments\nThe Company has agreements with certain equity investees (see Note 5) pursuant to which the Company has made or received payments for the receipt of goods or services. The Company recorded payments to equity investees totaling $\n189\n million, $\n180\n million and $\n213\n million during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\nF-36\nCHARTER COMMUNICATIONS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDecember 31, 2024, 2023 AND 2022\n(dollars in millions, except share or per share data or where indicated)\n19.    \nCommitments and Contingencies\nCommitments\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s payment obligations as of December 31, 2024 for its contractual obligations which consists of guaranteed minimum commitments, including rights negotiated directly with content owners for distribution on company-owned channels or networks, commitments related to our role as an advertising and distribution sales agent for third party-owned channels or networks, commitments to our customer premise equipment and device vendors, contractual obligations related to third-party network augmentation and guaranteed minimum commitments under the Company’s programming contracts.  \n2025\n$\n1,995\n\n2026\n1,344\n\n2027\n1,121\n\n2028\n728\n\n2029\n655\n\nThereafter \n4,945\n\n$\n10,788\n\nThe following items are not included in the contractual obligation table due to various factors discussed below.  However, the Company incurs these costs as part of its operations:\n•\nThe Company rents utility poles used in its operations.  Generally, pole rentals are cancelable on short notice, but the Company anticipates that such rentals will recur.  Rent expense incurred for pole rental attachments for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $\n243\n million, $\n230\n million and $\n207\n million, respectively.  \n•\nThe Company pays franchise fees under multi-year franchise agreements based on a percentage of revenues generated from video service per year.  The Company also pays other franchise related costs, such as public education grants, under multi-year agreements.  Franchise fees and other franchise-related costs included in the accompanying statement of operations were $\n604\n million, $\n664\n million and $\n730\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 respectively.\n•\nThe Company has $\n425\n million in letters of credit, of which $\n35\n million are issued under the Charter Operating credit facility, primarily to its various casualty carriers as collateral for reimbursement of workers' compensation, auto liability and general liability claims, as well as $\n416\n million of surety bonds.  \nLegal Proceedings\nThe California Attorney General and the Alameda County, California District Attorney are investigating whether certain of Charter’s waste disposal policies, procedures and practices are in violation of the California Business and Professions Code and the California Health and Safety Code. That investigation was commenced in January 2014. A similar investigation involving TWC was initiated in February 2012.  Charter is cooperating with these investigations.  While the Company is unable to predict the outcome of these investigations, it does not expect that the outcome will have a material effect on its operations, financial condition, or cash flows. \nThe Company is a defendant or co-defendant in several lawsuits involving alleged infringement of various intellectual property relating to various aspects of its businesses. Other industry participants are also defendants in certain of these cases or related cases. In the event that a court ultimately determines that the Company infringes on any intellectual property, the Company may be subject to substantial damages and/or an injunction that could require the Company or its vendors to modify certain products and services the Company offers to its subscribers, as well as negotiate royalty or license agreements with respect to the intellectual property at issue. While the Company believes the lawsuits are without merit and intends to defend the actions vigorously, no assurance can be given that any adverse outcome would not be material to the Company’s operations, consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. The Company cannot predict the outcome of any such claims nor can it reasonably estimate a range of possible loss.\nThe Company is party to other lawsuits, claims and regulatory inquiries or investigations that arise in the ordinary course of conducting its business or in connection with the Company’s participation in government funding programs. The ultimate \nF-37\nCHARTER COMMUNICATIONS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDecember 31, 2024, 2023 AND 2022\n(dollars in millions, except share or per share data or where indicated)\noutcome of these other legal matters pending against the Company cannot be predicted, and although such lawsuits and claims are not expected individually to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s operations, consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, such lawsuits could have, in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the Company’s operations, consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Whether or not the Company ultimately prevails in any particular lawsuit or claim, litigation can be time consuming and costly and injure the Company’s reputation.\n20.    \nEmployee Benefit Plans\nPension Plans\nThe Company sponsors qualified and unqualified defined benefit pension plans that provide pension benefits to a majority of employees who were employed by TWC before the merger with TWC.  Pension benefits are based on formulas that reflect the employees’ years of service and compensation during their employment period.  Actuarial gains or losses are changes in the amount of either the benefit obligation or the fair value of plan assets resulting from experience different from that assumed or from changes in assumptions.  The Company has elected to follow a mark-to-market pension accounting policy for recording the actuarial gains or losses annually during the fourth quarter, or earlier if a remeasurement event occurs during an interim period.\nIn June 2023, the Company purchased a buy-in group annuity contract (“GAC”) from a highly rated insurer and in October 2023, the Company announced plans to fully terminate the qualified pension plan. The benefit obligation for the qualified pension plan is determined on a plan termination basis for which it is assumed that a portion of eligible active and deferred vested participants will elect lump sum payments.  Pension obligations will be distributed through a combination of lump sum payments to eligible participants who elect such payments and through the GAC.\nChanges in the projected benefit obligation, fair value of plan assets and funded status of the pension plans from January 1 through December 31 are presented below:\n\n2024\n2023\nProjected benefit obligation at beginning of year\n$\n2,426\n\n$\n2,243\n\nInterest cost\n108\n\n117\n\nActuarial (gain) loss\n(\n141\n)\n222\n\nSettlement\n(\n127\n)\n(\n97\n)\nBenefits paid\n(\n60\n)\n(\n59\n)\nProjected benefit obligation at end of year\n\n$\n2,206\n\n$\n2,426\n\nAccumulated benefit obligation at end of year \n$\n2,206\n\n$\n2,426\n\nFair value of plan assets at beginning of year\n$\n2,553\n\n$\n2,583\n\nActual return on plan assets\n(\n56\n)\n124\n\nEmployer contributions\n3\n\n2\n\nSettlement\n(\n127\n)\n(\n97\n)\nBenefits paid\n(\n60\n)\n(\n59\n)\nFair value of plan assets at end of year \n$\n2,313\n\n$\n2,553\n\nFunded status\n$\n107\n\n$\n127\n\nF-38\nCHARTER COMMUNICATIONS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDecember 31, 2024, 2023 AND 2022\n(dollars in millions, except share or per share data or where indicated)\nThe components of net periodic benefit (cost) for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 consisted of the following:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nInterest cost\n$\n(\n108\n)\n$\n(\n117\n)\n$\n(\n103\n)\nExpected return on plan assets\n113\n\n124\n\n156\n\nRemeasurement gain (loss)\n(\n28\n)\n(\n223\n)\n201\n\nNet periodic pension benefit (cost)\n$\n(\n23\n)\n$\n(\n216\n)\n$\n254\n\nThe remeasurement loss recorded during the year ended December 31, 2024 was primarily driven by losses to record pension assets to fair value.  The remeasurement loss recorded during the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily reflects the measurement of the projected benefit obligations under a plan termination basis. The remeasurement gain recorded during the year ended December 31, 2022 was primarily driven by changes in the discount rate as well as gains or losses to record pension assets to fair value.\nThe discount rates used to determine benefit obligations as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 were \n5.08\n% and \n4.65\n%, respectively.  The Company utilized the 417(e) Applicable Mortality Table for lump sums for the portion of the benefit obligation not covered by the GAC as of December 31, 2024 and the Pri-2012/MP 2020 mortality table published by the Society of Actuaries to measure the benefit obligations as of December 31, 2022.  \nWeighted average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit costs consisted of the following:\nYear ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nExpected long-term rate of return on plan assets\n5.00\n\n%\n5.00\n\n%\n5.00\n\n%\nDiscount rate \n4.65\n\n%\n5.46\n\n%\n3.01\n\n%\nIn developing the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the Company considered the pension portfolio’s composition, past average rate of earnings and the Company’s future asset allocation targets.  The weighted average expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and discount rate used to determine net periodic pension benefit (cost) for the year ended December 31, 2025 are expected to be \n5.00\n% and \n5.08\n%, respectively.  The Company determined the discount rates used to determine benefit obligations and net periodic pension benefit (cost) based on the yield of a large population of high-quality corporate bonds with cash flows sufficient in timing and amount to settle projected future defined benefit payments.\nPension Plan Assets \nThe assets of the qualified pension plan are held in a master trust in which the qualified pension plan is the only participating plan (the “Master Trust”). The investment policy for the qualified pension plan is to manage the assets of the Master Trust with the objective to provide for pension liabilities to be met, seeking to maintain retirement income security for the participants of the plan and their beneficiaries. The investment portfolio is a mix of a GAC and pooled funds invested in fixed income securities, equity securities and certain alternative investments with the objective of matching plan liability performance, diversifying risk and achieving a target investment return.  Pension assets are managed in a balanced portfolio comprised of two major components: a return-seeking portion and a liability-matching portion. \nAs a result of the Company’s decision to terminate the qualified pension plan, the Company’s investment strategy has transitioned to liquidating and winding down the portfolio’s remaining return-seeking investments in a timely and orderly manner, while managing the liability-matching investments to hedge the interest rate risk of the liability for which the Company is still responsible (i.e., the liability not assumed by the GAC).\nF-39\nCHARTER COMMUNICATIONS, INC.
