        "content": "During the quarter ended March 30, 2025, the Company evaluated whether events or circumstances had changed such that  it was more likely than not that the fair value of its goodwill, intangible and other long-lived assets were less than their carrying amounts. After consideration of current operating results, changes in macro-economic conditions, and a decline in the Company’s market capitalization, the Company concluded that a triggering event had occurred for its Consumer Floral & Gifts reporting unit as of March 30, 2025.\n10\nTable of Contents\nThe Company performed its goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of its Consumer Floral and Gifts reporting unit to its respective carrying value. The Company estimated the fair value of the Consumer Floral and Gifts reporting unit using an equal weighting of the income and market approaches, and a discount rate of\n14.5\n%. The Company used industry accepted valuation models and set criteria that were reviewed and approved by various levels of management. Under the income approach, the Company used a discounted cash flow methodology that required management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to forecasted revenues, gross profit margins, operating income margins, working capital cash flow, perpetual growth rates, and long-term discount rates, among others. For the market approach, the Company used the guideline public company method. Under this method, the Company utilized information from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting units, to create valuation multiples that were applied to the operating performance of the reporting unit being tested, in order to obtain their respective fair values. The Company also reconciled the aggregate fair values of its reporting units to its current market capitalization.\nThe Company’s impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets encompassed calculating a fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset and comparing that result to its carrying value. To determine fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets, the Company used an income approach, the relief-from-royalty method. This method assumes that, in lieu of ownership, a third party would be willing to pay a royalty in order to obtain the rights to use the comparable asset. Indefinite-lived intangible assets’ fair values require significant judgments in determining both the assets’ estimated cash flows as well as the appropriate discount and royalty rates applied to those cash flows to determine fair value.\nThe Company’s impairment test for definite-lived and other long-lived assets was performed through a recoverability test, comparing projected undiscounted cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group to its carrying value.\nBased on the impairment assessment performed for the period ended March 30, 2025, the Company recorded a non-cash goodwill and intangible impairment charge of $\n138.2\n million, comprised of $\n113.4\n million attributable to goodwill and $\n24.8\n million attributable to the PersonalizationMall tradename within the same reporting unit. The Company concluded that definite-lived and other long-lived assets of the reporting unit were not impaired.\nIn the prior fiscal year, during the quarter ended December 31, 2023\n,\nas a result of a decline in the actual and projected revenue for the Company’s PersonalizationMall tradename, as well as a higher discount rate resulting from the higher interest rate environment, the Company determined that an impairment assessment was required for this tradename. This assessment resulted in the Company recording a non-cash impairment charge of $\n19.8\n million to reduce the recorded carrying value of the PersonalizationMall tradename to its estimated fair value at that time.\nAdditional Indefinite-Lived Intangible Asset Considerations\nFair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions, estimates, and market factors. Estimating the fair value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets requires the Company to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans, as well as industry, economic, and regulatory conditions. These assumptions and estimates include estimated future annual net cash flows, income tax considerations, discount rates, long-term growth rates, royalty rates, and other market factors. If current expectations of future growth rates and margins are not met, if market factors outside of our control change; such as discount rates, market capitalization, income tax rates, or inflation, or if management’s expectations or plans otherwise change, including updates to our long-term operating plans, then goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets might become impaired in the future.\nAs described above, goodwill for the Company’s Consumer Floral and Gifts reporting unit and the Company’s PersonalizationMall tradename were impaired during the quarter ended March 30, 2025 and were written down to their respective fair values resulting in zero excess fair value over carrying amount as of the impairment test date, resulting in a risk of future impairments if any assumptions, estimates, or market factors change in the future.\n\n11\nTable of Contents"

As such, the Company performed an impairment test of the reporting unit’s goodwill, intangibles and long-lived assets as of March 30, 2025.\nImpairment Assessments – Goodwill and Intangibles\nThe Company performed its goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of its Consumer Floral and Gifts reporting unit to its respective carrying value. The Company estimated the fair value of the Consumer Floral and Gifts reporting unit using an equal weighting of the income and market approaches, and a discount rate of 14.5%. The Company used industry accepted valuation models and set criteria that were reviewed and approved by various levels of management. Under the income approach, the Company used a discounted cash flow methodology that required management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to forecasted revenues, gross profit margins, operating income margins, working capital cash flow, perpetual growth rates, and long-term discount rates, among others. For the market approach, the Company used the guideline public company method. Under this method, the Company utilized information from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting units, to create valuation multiples that were applied to the operating performance of the reporting unit being tested, in order to obtain their respective fair values. The Company also reconciled the aggregate fair values of its reporting units to its current market capitalization.\nThe Company’s impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets encompassed calculating a fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset and comparing that result to its carrying value. To determine fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets, the Company used an income approach, the relief-from-royalty method. This method assumes that, in lieu of ownership, a third party would be willing to pay a royalty in order to obtain the rights to use the comparable asset. Indefinite-lived intangible assets’ fair values require significant judgments in determining both the assets’ estimated cash flows as well as the appropriate discount and royalty rates applied to those cash flows to determine fair value.\nThe Company’s impairment test for definite-lived and other long-lived assets was performed through a recoverability test, comparing projected undiscounted cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group to its carrying value.\nBased on the impairment assessment performed for the period ended March 30, 2025, the Company recorded a non-cash goodwill and intangible impairment charge of $138.2 million, comprised of $113.4 million attributable to goodwill and $24.8 million attributable to the PersonalizationMall tradename within the same reporting unit. The Company concluded that definite-lived and other long-lived assets of the reporting unit were not impaired.\nIncome Taxes\nRealizability of Deferred Tax Assets\nDuring the quarter ended March 30, 2025, in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets in accordance with ASC 740, management considered both positive and negative evidence. As of the reporting date, the Company was in a three-year cumulative loss position, which is considered significant negative evidence under the accounting standards. The Company has not developed any tax planning strategies that would provide an additional source of taxable income, and the goodwill and intangible impairment charge that was recorded during the quarter ended March 30, 2025 reduced the previously available deferred tax liabilities that had been relied upon to support the realization of deferred tax assets. As a result, the Company concluded that it was not more likely than not that a portion of its deferred tax assets will be realized and included a $24.9 million valuation allowance in its projected annual effective tax rate. In addition, the Company placed a specific valuation allowance of $3.4 million on its charitable contribution carryforward as a discrete item in the third quarter of fiscal 2025. As of March 30, 2025, the Company had valuation allowances of approximately $26.7 million, of which $20.5 million was recorded during the three months ended March 30, 2025, primarily related to net operating losses, charitable contributions, and deferred tax assets that are not more likely than not realizable. The Company will continue to monitor all relevant factors in evaluating the need for a valuation allowance and will reassess its position in future reporting periods as facts and circumstances evolve.\n35\nTable of Contents\n\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nSee"
