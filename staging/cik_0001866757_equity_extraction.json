Such decisions include the selection of the appropriate accounting principles to be applied and the assumptions on which to base accounting estimates. In reaching such decisions, we apply judgments based on our understanding and analysis of the relevant circumstances, historical experience, and current trends. Actual amounts could differ from those estimated at the time the audited consolidated financial statements are prepared.\nOur significant accounting policies are described in Note 2, \nSummary of significant accounting policies\n, to our accompanying financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of those significant accounting policies require us to make difficult, subjective, or complex judgments or estimates. An accounting estimate is considered to be critical if it meets both of the following criteria: (i) the estimate requires assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made, and (ii) different estimates reasonably could have been used, or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition, changes in financial condition, or results of operations. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors –Risks related to the Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock – \nIf our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies and estimates prove to be incorrect, our results of operations could be adversely affected\n. \n81"
